## 🛠️ Modules Overview

### 1. PDF Parsing

* **Purpose**: Cleanly extract text from academic PDFs.
* **Workflow**:

  1. Load PDFs from a directory.
  2. Remove low‑priority sections (`References`, `Contributors`, `Affiliations`).
  3. Split or trim content to fit LED’s 16k‑token limit.
  4. Save structured output to CSV for downstream processing.

### 2. Dataset Scraping

* **Sources**:

  * [aimodels.fyi](https://aimodels.fyi/) (\~140 papers)
  * [PapersWithCode SOTA](https://paperswithcode.com/) (\~500 papers)
* **Insights**:

  * Smaller dataset (138 entries) yielded minimal ROUGE gains.
  * Expanded dataset (503 entries) improved scores but required quality filtering.

### 3. Preference‑Pair Generation

* **Goal**: Create winning/losing summary pairs for DPO fine‑tuning.
* **Process**: Compare outputs from different LoRA variants to label preferences.

### 4. Fine‑Tuning Strategies

* **LoRA Exploration**: Tested various LoRA configurations; selected best by ROUGE improvement.
* **DPO Refinement**: Further polished the chosen LoRA model with Direct Preference Optimization.

### 5. Demo

* **Gradio App**: Quick web interface for uploading PDFs and receiving Gen Z summaries.
* **Components**:

  * `pdf_parser.py`: Preprocesses PDFs on the fly.
  * `demo.ipynb`: Notebook to launch the Gradio server.
