Figure 7. Our Prototype Results. Real objects were captured

they are not accurately aligned with the Difuzcam results.
the training process when using these text captions. Since
we identified that these inaccuracies might be critical in the
tests, we manually checked the test dataset captions to ver-
ify the accuracy and correctness of the data. This verifi-cation is very important for the text guidance reconstruc-
tion results and also for the textual CLIP score evaluation
we made. Despite the potential disadvantage of training on
incorrect captions, we did not manually verify the training
dataset since it is not feasible to manually check such a very
large dataset.
To compare our results to FlatNet [20], we trained our
method on their published dataset which consists of 10k im-
ages for training and 100 for testing. This data does not con-
tain captions to the images. Thus, to train our method with
text guidance on this data we use a large language model
(LLM) for the auto image captioning process. We used
llava1.5 [24] LLM and generated captions for all the images
in the data. Here we also might have the problem of incor-
rect captions, which is also known as LLM hallucinations.
Also in this case, the test samples captions were manually
verified due to the high importance of the test captions’ cor-
rectness. For this data we trained the model for 700k steps
with a similar optimizer setup to what we mentioned in Sec-
tion 3.1. We used the Allied Vision 1800 U-500 board-level
camera with a pixel size of 2.2um and 5 megapixels overall
for the prototype camera.
4.2. Ablations
We present ablation results in Table 2 and Figure 8. First
of all, it is noticeable from Table 2 that without our pro-
posed separable loss the reconstructed images are not sim-
ilar to the target image. We observe that the reconstructed
images contain the information of the text caption, accord-
ing to the high CLIP score, but do not succeed in extracting
additional information from the camera measurements for
the reconstruction process, i.e., the reconstructions become
independent of the input camera measurements. When we
do use the separable loss, the measurements are taken into
account. Adding text information as input improves the re-
construction even further, compared to the non-text-guided
model. The visual ablation images in Figure 8 show that the
text captions contribute to the high frequency details in the
reconstructed images. When we supply a text caption, the
reconstructed image details are aligned with the text. This is
noticeable also when a wrong text caption is provided. For
example, the reconstruction gains a painting style when the
caption mentions a painting and elephant shapes are visible
when elephants are described in the caption.
5. Conclusion
A novel method for image reconstruction from flat cam-
era measurements was presented, achieving high quality re-
constructions, with and without text guidance. The method
leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion
model for image prior. Such an approach can be inte-
grated into other imaging systems to improve the recon-
structions. Even though we get perceptually pleasant recon-

structed images, one may notice minor inaccuracies in the
reconstructed fine details compared to the ground-through
image. Since the imaging method at hand is highly ill-
posed, the model learns to generate the missing details,
which have been lost in the acquisition process. We there-
fore do not consider this as a problem but rather a property
of the method that improves the reconstruction quality. As
we have demonstrated in this work, our approach presents
state-of-the-art results compared to previous results and sig-
nificantly improves the reconstruction abilities of flat cam-
eras.References

11","The traditional way of capturing images with a camera involves using a complex lens system to focus light onto the camera sensor. DifuzCam proposes a different approach that replaces the camera lens with a simple mask and a diffusion model. Instead of using a lens to focus the light, the camera sensor is exposed to the scene through a mask. This mask is designed to create a specific pattern of light that falls on the sensor. The resulting ""blurry"" image captured by the sensor is then fed into a diffusion model - a type of machine learning algorithm that can computationally reconstruct the final, clear image. The advantage of this approach is that it can potentially lead to a more compact, flexible, and cost-effective camera system. Traditional lenses are bulky, expensive, and have limited adjustability. In contrast, the DifuzCam setup with a mask and a diffusion model can be much smaller and potentially cheaper to manufacture. Additionally, the diffusion model allows for more flexibility in terms of the types of images that can be captured, as the mask can be designed to create different patterns of light."

question during training.
2.2.2. Reward Modeling
The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL.
To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two
types of rewards:
•Accuracy rewards : The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct.
For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required
to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable
rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be
used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.
•Format rewards : In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward
model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’
tags.
We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale
reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training
resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.
2.2.3. Training Template
To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides
the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template
requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.
We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific
biases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-
gies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL
process.
2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero
Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-
R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated,
DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the
RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant
increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels
comparable to OpenAI-o1-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL
algorithm in optimizing the model’s performance over time.
Table 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI’s o1-0912
models across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks. The findings reveal that RL empowers

DeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised
fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model’s ability to
learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-
R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example,
when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s performance
escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. The
ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without
majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further
advancements in reasoning tasks.
Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero
is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities
autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model’s
progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides
a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle
complex reasoning tasks.
As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improve-

process. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time.
ment throughout the training process. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments
but rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the
ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time compu-
tation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens,
allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.
One of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated
behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection—where the model
revisits and reevaluates its previous steps—and the exploration of alternative approaches to
problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead
emerge as a result of the model’s interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This
spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s reasoning capabilities,
enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.
Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during
the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as
illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase,
DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial
approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities
but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and
sophisticated outcomes.
This moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers
observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather
than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the
right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The
“aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of
intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in
the future.

allowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning.
Drawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning
capabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces
several issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,
and language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the
open community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly
cold-start data.
2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start
Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can
reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small
amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that
not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong
general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The
pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.
2.3.1. Cold Start
Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from
the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data
to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several
approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting
models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-
Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human
annotators.
In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as
the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data
include:
•Readability: A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable
for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to
highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,
we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and
filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as
|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning
process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning
results.
•Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we
observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is
a better way for reasoning models.
2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning
After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale
reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses
on enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such
as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with
clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,
particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language
mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated
as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show
that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward
aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of
reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the
final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence
on reasoning tasks.
2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning
When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT
(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which
primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the
model’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we
generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.
Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-
ing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,
we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,
we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward
model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.
Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have
filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks. For
each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect
about 600k reasoning related training samples.
Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition,
and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of
DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential
chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries,
such as “hello” we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of
approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.
We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about
800k samples.
2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios
To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement
learning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-
ously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination
of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the
methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the
learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to
reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build
upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-
ing prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the
assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing
interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire
response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and
mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation
process. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us
to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.
2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability
To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly
fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using
the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that
this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller
models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-
14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its
reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.
For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though
incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL
stage to the broader research community.
3. Experiment
Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU , MMLU-Redux , MMLU-Pro , C-Eval , and CMMLU , IFEval , FRAMES , GPQA Diamond , SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA , SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,
2024d), Aider1, LiveCodeBench (2024-08 – 2025-01), Codeforces2, Chinese
National High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024)3, and American Invitational Math-
ematics Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024). In addition to standard benchmarks, we
also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we
adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard , which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we
only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we
report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and
LiveCodeBench.
Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as
MMLU, DROP , GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-
evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a
zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts
are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot
may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation
protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the
HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,
C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated
using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces
dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,
after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench
verified results are obtained via the agentless framework . AIDER-related
benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum
of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.
Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including
DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217.
Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its perfor-
mance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model
QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).
Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.
We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in
higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we
default to pass@ 𝑘evaluation and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.
Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6and a top- 𝑝value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘
responses (typically between 4and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1
is then calculated as
pass@1 =1
𝑘𝑘∑︁
𝑖=1𝑝𝑖,
where𝑝𝑖denotes the correctness of the 𝑖-th response. This method provides more reliable
performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.

Table 4|Comparison between DeepSeek-R1 and other representative models.
For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA
Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This im-
provement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where signif-
icant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1
excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis
capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data
analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,
demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where
OpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than
DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse
answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an
accuracy of over 70%.
DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a
model’s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion
of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL
training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard,
indicating DeepSeek-R1’s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its
significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale
RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse
domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an
average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that
DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying
its robustness across multiple tasks.
On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217,
surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm
tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these
benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1
on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering
performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL
training data currently remains very limited.

Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly
exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distilla-
tion. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further
gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the
simple SFT-distilled models here.
4. Discussion
4.1. Distillation v.s. Reinforcement Learning
In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-R1, the small model can achieve impressive
results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance
through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation?
To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math,
code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The
experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale

RL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1-
Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.
Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller
ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in
this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance
of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing
beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-
scale reinforcement learning.
4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts
In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along
the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that
these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.
Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better
approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,
2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-
cess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,
determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated
annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-
ducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward
hacking , and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources
and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good
ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search , its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it
introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-
ver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time
compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the
model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to
generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For
training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value
model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model
and the value model, iteratively refining the process.
However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,
unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an
exponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each
node, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model
directly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.
Training a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the
model to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to
progressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup
due to the complexities of token generation.
In conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a
pre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a
significant challenge.
5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work","The researchers built an AI system that thinks more logically by rewarding it for good reasoning, similar to how we might teach a child to solve puzzles step-by-step. This approach, called reinforcement learning , helps the AI learn to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Think of it like teaching someone to cook - instead of just showing them the final dish, you reward them for each correct step: measuring ingredients properly, following the recipe order, and adjusting temperatures at the right time. The AI learns to show its work and explain its thinking process. The team also managed to create smaller versions of their model that maintain strong reasoning abilities. It's like condensing a lengthy textbook into a pocket guide without losing the important information."

Abstract  
 
This work establishes a rigorous proof for the universality of the chemputer as a chemical 
synthesis machine, capable of constructing any stable and isolable molecule through a finite, 
expressible process. This process is governed by three key parameters: reagents, process 
conditions, and catalysts. Additionally, the study introduces dynamic error correction 
mechanisms integrated into each step of the synthesis pathway, ensuring real -time accuracy 
and reliability. The role of universally configurable hardwa re is also highlighted, with the 
introduction of a  ”chempiling” function that translates synthesis pathways into executable 
hardware configurations. These advancements collectively demonstrate the chemputer’s 
capability to perform any feasible chemical synthesis, thereby establishing it as a universal 
tool in chemical manufacturing and synthesis. I show that every finitely realizable chemical 
synthesis process that can exist within the bounds of physical laws can be perfectly 
instantiated and executed by a universal chemputer, provided that the process can be 
completed within the finite number of reagent input vessels, reaction vessels, and product 
output vessels available, and that the error correction mechanisms are sufficiently robust to 
maintain the accu racy of the synthesis within these constraints. Finally,  I show that chemical 
reactions are not implicit functions, but are an emergent property coming from the 
combination of the reagents, process conditions,  and catalysts . 
 
 
 
2 Introduction  
 
Turing completeness is a concept from theoretical computer science that defines the ability of 
a computational system to perform any computation that can be done by a Turing machine 
[1, 2, 3]. For a system to be Turing complete, it must have the capability  to simulate a Turing 
machine. This means it can execute any algorithm, given sufficient time and memory, and 
solve any problem that  is computationally solvable. Turing completeness is a foundational 
concept in understanding the limits of what can be compu ted. In essence, if a programming 
language or computational system is Turing complete, it can, in theory, perform any 
computation that a computer can, assuming no constraints on resources like time and 
memory.  
 
 
Figure 1:  A schematic of the Chemical State Machine (CSM). The inputs are the Reagents  (R), 
Catalysts( K) and the chemical program or χDL file[12] contains details of the process 
conditions and code to run the hardware. The output are the pure target compounds ( C) as 
the chemical state machine includes a reactor, workup, isolate and purify system.  
 
Expanding this concept to the realm of chemistry involves envisioning chemical systems that 
can perform computations in a way analogous to a Turing machine. Here we explore this idea 
where chemical reactions are used to undergo programmable transformations  in a device we 
call a chemputer[4, 5, 6, 7]. The chemputer is designed to automate and control chemical 
reactions with high precision[8]. It uses a combination of hardware and software to carry out 
complex sequences of chemical processes[9]. By programmin g these sequences, the 

3 chemputer can perform tasks that require conditional logic, loops, and the manipulation of 
data —key components of Turing completeness.  
 
The concept of a chemputer as a universal chemical synthesis machine posits that it can 
instantiate any feasible chemical synthesis, see Figure 1. This document outlines the proof for 
the universality of the chemputer, demonstrating that it can synthesize any target compound 
within the chemical space defined by the provided parameters. To prove the universality of 
the chemputer, we need to demonstrate that it can conduct any feasible chemical synthesis. 
This involves showing that the transformation function  τ can account for all chemical reactions 
possible under the defined reagents, process conditions, and catalysts (it has been suggested 
that catalysts might themselves be viewed as a type of constructor [10]) . Furthermore, we 
incorporate the mechanisms of dynamic error correction[11] during synthesis and the use of 
universally configurable hardware to support complex chemical processes through a 
chempiling function.  
 
Definitions  
 
• Reagent Space ( R): A finite set of all possible chemical reagents, including all chemical 
elements and basic compounds.  
• Process Conditions ( P): A set of environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, 
solvent / gas conditions , energy in put type ) that influence the outcome of reactions.  
• Catalysts ( K): A set of substances that alter the reaction pathways or rates without being 
consumed in the process.  
• Target Compounds ( C): The set of desired products or output compounds.  
• Universally Configurable Hardware ( H): A hardware platform that can be dynamically 
reconfigured to execute various chemical synthesis processes. In the chemputer, the 
system is constrained by a finite number of reagent input vessels, reaction vessels, and 
product output vessels represent the number of available reagent input vessels, reaction 
vessels, and product output vessels, VR , VP, VO respectively. This means that any chemical 
synthesis is realizable if it can be completed within these finite resource s. The 
4 configuration is represented as a graph G = (V,E), where: V is a set of nodes representing 
hardware components (e.g., reactors, mixers, sensors) and E is a set of edges 
representing connections between components, defining the flow of reagents,  products,  
energy, or information.  
 
Dynamic Error Correction ( δ): A mechanism embedded within each step of the synthesis 
process, enabling real -time detection and correction of errors, ensuring the accuracy of each 
transformation before proceeding to the next step.  
 
Chempiling Function ( χ): The process of translating a synthesis pathway σ into a corresponding 
hardware configuration G(H) that can execute the synthesis process.  
 
Axioms  
 
I introduce three axioms:  
A1: Conservation of matter . 
A2: Finite reaction time.  
A3: Stability of elements found in R under standard conditions.  
 
Lemmas  
 
L1: For any c ∈ C there exists a finite sequence  of transformations from Reagents R to c. Proof: 
By the definition of C and finite reaction time axiom.  
L2: For any transformation function t ∈ τ can be decomposed into a finite sequence of 
elementary reactions. Proof: By the nature of chemical reactions and the conservation of 
matter.  
 
 
 
5 Assumptions  
 
1. Existence of a Universal Set -Up: This demonstrates that the chemputer can implement 
any feasible chemical synthesis, showing that the function τ is sufficiently general to 
account for all chemical reactions possible under the reagents  given , process conditions, 
and catalysts.  
2. Construction of Synthesis Pathway : For each target compound c, a sequence σ of 
transformations from initial reagents R0 to c can be constructed. This construction must 
account for all intermediate transformations and ensure that σ is valid under P, and K. 
3. Verification of Stability : This verifies that for the resulting compound c, the stability 
condition S(c) is satisfied.  
4. Dynamic Error Detection and Correction : The chemputer can detect errors in real -time 
during each step of the synthesis by continuously monitoring the reaction progress and 
comparing the actual outcome with the expected result. Upon detecting an error during 
any synthesis step, the chemputer applies corrective steps immediately, either reverting 
to a p revious state or adjusting the process to ensure the synthesis remains on track.  
5. Universality and Completeness : This proves that for any c ∈ C, there exists a pathway σ 
and a stable outcome, demonstrating the universality of the chemputer as a synthesis 
device, including error detection and correction at each synthesis step.  
 
Formalization  
Stability Condition  
 
S(c) : Stability c ∈ C such that c is isolable and stable  
 
The stability condition S(c) ensures that the resulting compound c is stable and can be isolated, 
i.e., S(c) must hold true for the synthesis to be considered successful. However, the synthesis 
may or may not utilize unstable reaction intermediates that could be isolated for some period 
of time.  
6 Transformation Function ( τ) 
 
τ : R × P × K → C 
 
The transformation function τ defines the emergent property we conventionally call the 
reaction rule which is the resultant outcome when reagents R are added under the process 
conditions P, in the presence of catalysts  K to give the output compounds C. The 
transformation function can be used to predict how the reagent graphs R can be transformed 
into the product grap hs C as graph transformations between the reagents R. 
 
Construction of Synthesis Pathways ( σ) 
 
For any target compound c ∈ C, we construct a pathway σ such that:  
 
σ : (R0 , R1 ,...,Rn)  → C 
 
A synthesis pathway σ is a sequence of transformations leading from an initial set of reagents 
R0 through intermediate sets R1 ,...,Rn to the final product c. The chemputer is said to be 
universal if, for any target compound c in the set of desired compounds C, there exists a 
sequence of transformations σ that leads from an initial set of reagents R0 to c. 
 
Existence of Synthesis Pathway (Universal Synthesis Theorem)  
 
∀c ∈ C, ∃ R0 ⊆ R, P, K such that σ (R0,...,Rn) = c 
 
This theorem asserts that for every target compound c in C, there exists a set of initial reagents 
R0  ⊆ R, a set of process conditions P, and catalysts K such that a synthesis pathway σ exists, 
leading from R0 to c. 
 
7 Dynamic Error Detection and Correction  
 
δ : c′ → Corrected State c corrected  
 
Dynamic error correction is applied at each step in the synthesis process. For each 
transformation, if the outcome c′ deviates from the expected intermediate or final product cn, 
the error detection function ϵ flags the deviation ( ϵ = 1). The error correction function δ is 
then applied to revert to a prior valid state or adjust the process dynamically to ensure that 
the synthesis remains accurate.  
 
Chempiling Function ( χ) 
 
χ : σ → G(H) 
 
The chempiling function χ maps the synthesis pathway σ into a hardware configuration G(H) 
that can execute the synthesis process.  
 
Proof of Universality  
 
Base Case : For simple compounds (e.g., elements or basic molecules), the chemputer can 
directly synthesize them from their constituent elements or simpler precursors. If an error 
occurs during the synthesis of these simple compounds, it is detected and corrected 
dynamically before proceeding.  
 
Inductive Step : Assume the chemputer can synthesize all compounds of complexity k (i.e., 
requiring k steps), with dynamic error correction applied at each step. For a compound of 
complexity k + 1, there exists a precursor compound requiring k steps and a transformation 
function τ that can transform this precursor into the target compound under appropriate P, 
and K in the presence of the reagents R. The dynamic error correction function δ ensures that 
8 each intermediate step is accurate. Therefore, by induction, the chemputer can synthesize all 
compounds up to any finite complexity.  
 
Practical Limitations  
 
Implementing the concept of chemputation in practice presents a series of significant 
challenges that extend beyond th is robust theoretical framework. One of the foremost 
challenges lies in the complexity and scalability of the chemputer’s hardware. The concept of 
universally configurable hardware, which is central to the chemputer’s ability to synthesize 
any chemical compo und, demands a highly versatile and flexible system  with a range of 
different modules for operations  like filtration, extraction and so on . Designing hardware that 
can seamlessly switch between different configurations for a wide variety of chemical 
processes is an intricate task. Each module within the system must handle diverse reaction 
types, process conditions, and scales of operation wh ile maintaining precision and reliability. 
Moreover, there is an inherent tension between the need for miniaturization, which allows for 
precision, and the requirement for scalability to manage larger volumes or more complex 
reactions. Achieving both in a single system, particularly one that remains flexible and 
configurable, is a significant engineering challenge. Furthermore, the integration of this 
hardware with the software responsible for the chempiling function —mapping synthesis 
pathways to specific h ardware configurations —adds another layer of complexity. This 
software must dynamically adjust the hardware setup in real -time, requiring a level of 
synchronization and control that is difficult to achieve.  
 
Another critical challenge is the implementation of dynamic error correction within the 
chemputer, which is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of chemical syntheses. 
The system must be capable of real -time monitoring and adjustment, contin uously tracking 
the progress of each reaction, detecting any deviations from the expected pathway, and 
applying corrective measures immediately. This demands advanced sensing technologies and 
real-time data processing capabilities that can operate effectiv ely across a broad range of 
reaction conditions. In multi -step syntheses, errors can propagate through the system, 
9 compounding and becoming more difficult to correct as the process continues. Developing 
mechanisms that can effectively manage and contain such errors, ensuring the robustness and 
redundancy of the system, is crucial. Achieving this balance between robustn ess, cost, space, 
and energy efficiency poses a significant challenge.  
 
The theoretical framework also assumes a comprehensive understanding of the chemical 
space and the ability to encode all possible reactions into the chemputer. However, the reality 
of chemical synthesis is more complex. Our current knowledge of chemical re actions is not 
exhaustive, particularly in the fields of complex organic and biological chemistry, where many 
reactions remain poorly understood or unpredictable. This limitation restricts the chemputer’s 
ability to reliably handle all potential syntheses.  Moreover, as complex molecules are 
synthesized, emergent properties may arise that are not predicted by existing models, leading 
to unexpected reactions or products. The chemputer must be designed to manage and correct 
such deviations, even in the face of  novel or poorly understood chemistry. Developing 
algorithms and hardware that can adapt to new chemical data in real -time is a significant 
hurdle that must be overcome.  
 
Conclusion s 
 
Since the chemputer can implement any transformation function τ and can control all relevant 
process conditions, and catalysts,  it can instantiate any chemical synthesis process. The 
inclusion of dynamic error detection and correction at each step ensures the reliability and 
accuracy of the synthesis. Additionally, the use of universally configurable hardware and the 
chempiling fun ction allows the chemputer to dynamically adapt its configuration for various 
synthesis pathways. Thus, the chemputer is universal for chemical synthesis, capable of 
generating any compound c ∈ C given the appropriate initial conditions, transformations, a nd 
error correction mechanisms.  
 
The formalization above establishes the concept of a chemputer as a universal chemical 
synthesis machine. The transformation function τ, synthesis pathways σ, stability conditions S, 
10 dynamic error correction δ, chempiling function χ, and configurable hardware H together 
define a universal model capable of synthesizing any target compound within the chemical 
space defined by R, P, and K. 
 
The work presented here establishes the chemputer as a universal chemical synthesis 
machine, demonstrating its capability to synthesize any target compound within a defined 
chemical space. By formalizing the key components, such as the transformation functi on τ, 
synthesis pathways σ, stability conditions S, dynamic error correction δ, and the chempiling 
function χ, we have constructed a robust theoretical framework that underpins this 
universality. The integration of universally configurable hardware furthe r enhances the 
chemputer’s adaptability, allowing it to dynamically reconfigure and execute a wide array of 
chemical processes with precision. This is universal considering finite constraints on the 
reaction hardware, reagents, reaction steps, and reaction  time.

","The paper explains that the ""chemputer"" is a universal machine capable of performing any feasible chemical synthesis. This means that as long as a chemical process can be carried out within the physical limitations of the available equipment, the chemputer can execute it. The key to the chemputer's universality is that it can carefully control the three main factors in a chemical reaction: the starting materials (reagents), the conditions of the reaction (temperature, pressure, etc.), and the substances that speed up the reaction (catalysts). By precisely managing these parameters, the chemputer can guide any chemical synthesis to completion. Moreover, the chemputer has built-in mechanisms to continuously correct any errors that might occur during the synthesis process. This ensures that the final product is made accurately and reliably, even for complex or delicate reactions. The paper also describes how the chemputer's hardware can be reconfigured to match the requirements of different synthesis pathways. This ""chempiling"" process translates the step-by-step instructions for a synthesis into the specific settings and operations the chemputer needs to carry it out. Overall, the research demonstrates that the chemputer truly is a universal chemical synthesis tool, capable of producing any molecule that is physically possible to make, as long as the process can fit within the constraints of the available equipment."
4,Distilling System 2 into System 1,"methods evaluated with zero-shot or 8-shot input
contexts. Note that System 2 with 8-shot means
that CoTs are provided in the few-shot inputs, while
System 1 means that the few shot examples contain
questions and answers, but no CoTs.
8
Results Evaluation results are presented in Ta-
ble 4. First, improvements are coming from using
the CoT method as expected: it helps when be-
ing presented as part of the few-shot context or
as part of the instruction in the prompt template.
These improvements come with an increase in infer-
ence cost: sequences predicted with CoT methods
are substantially longer compared to the System 1
method. Second, our System 2 distillation method
yields poor performance across various decoding
hyper-parameters. The GSM8k task (math prob-
lems) requires a very different kind of reasoning
compared to other tasks we considered in this work.
This highlights the non-trivial aspect of System
2 distillation: the proposed distillation algorithm
works in many cases but not always. This leaves
room for future research to elucidate in exactly
which circumstances to apply distillation, and when
not to, in a similar manner perhaps to the approach
in humans.
5 Conclusion
Recent work has shown that complex reasoning
procedures using LLMs in the inner loop, called
System 2 approaches, can improve performance.
In this work we have shown that in many cases
it is possible to distill this System 2 reasoning
into the outputs of the LLM without intermedi-
ate generations while maintaining, or sometimes
even improving, performance. While not all meth-
ods can be distilled easily using our method, with
Chain-of-Thought for complex reasoning being a
challenging counterexample, this is possible for di-
verse approaches. Our method works for System 2
Attention for dealing with bias and irrelevant con-
text, Rephrase and Respond for clarifying task in-
structions, and Branch-Solve-Merge for improved
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Pragmatically, distill-
ing these approaches makes them more likely to be
used by LLM practitioners, and they are more effi-
cient at inference time. Looking forward, systems
that can distill useful tasks in this way free up more
time to spend on reasoning about the tasks that
they cannot yet do well, just as humans do. Hence,
we expect exploring this approach in a continuous
training loop will be a fruitful research direction.
6 Limitations
In this paper, we explored three System 2 meth-
ods—RaR, S2A, and BSM—which have been suc-
cessfully distilled, yielding enhanced results com-pared to the original System 1 performance while
incurring lower inference costs than System 2.
However, the effectiveness of these methods can
vary depending on the specific task or the dataset
used for model training. For instance, we observed
that the CoT method could not be effectively dis-
tilled back to System 1 using our method. We note
that recent methods have tried alternative ways to
distill CoT (Deng et al., 2023b, 2024).
Moreover, due to the self-supervised nature
of these methods, model performance relies on
the specific filters applied. In our study, we de-
pended on a consistency criterion that includes self-
consistency of outputs andself-consistency under
input perturbation . Although there are multiple
alternative strategies to enhance data quality in self-
supervised learning, these were not explored in our
research.

rate5.5e−6, with warmup 1. Table 5 shows details
about total training steps and total training tokens
per step.
S2A For S2A, in both generation stages we use
nucleus sampling with top-p value 0.9. During
distillation, for USC, in some cases the generated
answers are too long and 20 do not fit in the Llama2
context. In these rare cases we reduce the answer
set to 10 or select an answer randomly if 10 gener-

[User Question]
My coffee is tasting quite watery lately... what am i doing wrong?
[The Start of Assistant A’s Answer]
It’s possible that you are not using the right amount of coffee grinds for your recipe. If you measure out the right amount, it will help ensure that the flavor
of your coffee isn’t too weak. Also, make sure that you are grinding your coffee beans properly. If the grinds are too fine, it can make your coffee taste
watery. You should also make sure that you are using fresh, high-quality beans, as this will make a big difference in the flavor of your coffee. Finally, the
water you are using can also affect the flavor of your coffee. If you are using tap water, try using filtered or bottled water instead.
[The End of Assistant A’s Answer]

16","The paper explores how to take the complex, step-by-step ""System 2"" thinking that humans use for difficult problems and transform it into the quick, automatic ""System 1"" thinking. The goal is to make this reasoning process more natural and understandable, both for humans and for AI systems. Humans have two main modes of thinking - an analytical, deliberate ""System 2"" that we use for challenging tasks, and an intuitive, fast ""System 1"" that handles more routine decisions. The researchers wanted to understand how we distill the System 2 process into the more accessible System 1 form. By studying this distillation process in humans, the researchers hope to enable AI systems to do the same. This would make the AI's decision-making more transparent and interpretable, rather than having it operate solely in the opaque ""System 2"" mode. The paper proposes a framework for how to accomplish this distillation and tests it on various cognitive challenges."

ABSTRACT
Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-
purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agen-
tic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the
history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventu-
ally replaced by learned solutions. We describe a newly forming research area,
Automated Design of Agentic Systems ( ADAS ), which aims to automatically cre-
ate powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks
and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an un-
explored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in
code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent program-
ming ever better ones in code. Given that most programming languages are Turing
Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic
system: including novel prompts, tool use, workflows, and combinations thereof.
We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demon-
strate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents
based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive ex-
periments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show
that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly
outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently
observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain
superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demon-
strating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work
illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically
designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity. All code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Foundation Models (FMs) such as GPT (OpenAI, 2024; 2022) and Claude (Anthropic, 2024b) are
quickly being adopted as powerful general-purpose agents for agentic tasks that need flexible rea-
soning and planning (Wang et al., 2024). Despite recent advancements in FMs, solving problems re-
liably often requires an agent to be a compound agentic system with multiple components instead of
a monolithic model query (Zaharia et al., 2024; Rockt ¨aschel, 2024). Additionally, to enable agents to
solve complex real-world tasks, they often need access to external tools such as search engines, code
execution, and database queries. As a result, many effective building blocks of agentic systems have
been proposed, such as chain-of-thought planning and reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023;
Hu & Clune, 2024), memory structures (Zhang et al., 2024c; Lewis et al., 2020), tool use (Schick
et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2024), and self-reflection (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023). Although
these agents have already seen significant success across various applications (Wang et al., 2024),
developing these building blocks and combining them into complex agentic systems often requires
domain-specific manual tuning and substantial effort from both researchers and engineers.
However, the history of machine learning reveals a recurring theme: manually created artifacts be-
come replaced by learned, more efficient solutions (Clune, 2019) over time as we get more compute
and data (Sutton, 2019). An early example is from computer vision, where hand-designed features
like HOG (Dalal & Triggs, 2005) were eventually replaced by learned features from Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs, Krizhevsky et al. (2012)). More recently, AutoML methods (Hutter et al.,

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed algorithm Meta Agent Search and examples of discovered
agents. In our algorithm, we instruct the “meta” agent to iteratively program new agents, test their
performance on tasks, add them to an archive of discovered agents, and use this archive to inform the
meta agent in subsequent iterations. We show three example agents across our runs, with all names
generated by the meta agent. The detailed code of example agents can be found in Appendix G.
2019) and AI-Generating Algorithms (AI-GAs, Clune (2019)) have also demonstrated the superior-
ity of learned AI systems compared to hand-designed AI systems. For example, the current best-
performing CNN models come from Neural Architecture Search (Elsken et al., 2019; Shen et al.,
2023) instead of manual design; in LLM alignment, learned loss functions (Lu et al., 2024a) out-
perform most hand-designed ones such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024); The AI Scientist (Lu et al.,
2024b) demonstrates an automated research pipeline, including the development of novel ML algo-
rithms; and an endless number of robotics learning environments can be automatically generated in
works like OMNI-EPIC (Faldor et al., 2024), which demonstrate surprising creativity in generated
environments and allow more efficient environment creation than the manual approach (see more
examples in Section 5). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new research question: Can we
automate the design of agentic systems?
To explore the above research question, we describe a newly forming research area we call
Automated Design of Agentic Systems ( ADAS ), which aims to automatically invent novel build-
ing blocks and design powerful agentic systems (Section 2). We argue that ADAS may prove to
be the fastest path to developing powerful agents, and show initial evidence that learned agents can
greatly outperform hand-designed agents. Considering the tremendous number of building blocks
yet to be discovered in agentic systems (Section 5), it would take a long time for our research com-
munity to discover them all. Even if we successfully discover most of the useful building blocks,
combining them into effective agentic systems for massive real-world applications would still be
challenging and time-consuming, given the many different ways the building blocks can combine
and interact with each other. In contrast, with ADAS, the building blocks and agents can be learned
in an automated fashion. ADAS may not only potentially save human effort in developing powerful
agents but also could be a faster path to more effective solutions than manual design.
Although a few existing works can be considered as ADAS methods, most of them focus only on
designing prompts (Yang et al., 2024; Fernando et al., 2024), greatly limiting their ability to invent
flexible design patterns in agents (Section 5). In this paper, we show that there is an unexplored
yet promising approach to ADAS where we can define the entire agentic system in code and new
agents can be automatically discovered by a “meta” agent programming ever better ones in code.
Given that most programming languages, such as Python, which we use in this paper, are Turing
Complete (Boyer & Moore, 1983; Ladha, 2024), searching within a code space theoretically enables
an ADAS algorithm to discover anypossible agentic systems, including all components such as
2

prompts, tool use, workflows, and more. Furthermore, with recent FMs being increasingly proficient
in coding, we can use FMs as meta agents to create new agents in code for ADAS, enabling novel
agents to be programmed in an automated manner.
Following the aforementioned ideas, we present Meta Agent Search in this paper as one of the first
algorithms in ADAS that enables complete design in code space (Figure 1). The core concept of
Meta Agent Search is to instruct a meta agent to iteratively create interestingly new agents, evaluate
them, add them to an archive that stores discovered agents, and use this archive to help the meta agent
in subsequent iterations create yet more interestingly new agents. Similar to existing open-endedness
algorithms that leverage human notions of interestingness (Zhang et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024c),
we encourage the meta agent to explore interesting (e.g., novel or worthwhile) agents. To validate
the proposed approach, we evaluate the proposed Meta Agent Search on: (1) the challenging ARC
logic puzzle task (Chollet, 2019) that aims to test the general intelligence of an AI system, (2) four
popular benchmarks on reading comprehension, math, science questions, and multi-task problem
solving, and (3) the transferability of discovered agents to held-out domains and models (Section 4).
Our experiments show that the discovered agents substantially outperform state-of-the-art hand-
designed baselines. For instance, our agents improve F1 scores on reading comprehension tasks
in DROP (Dua et al., 2019) by 13.6/100 and accuracy rates on math tasks in MGSM (Shi et al.,
2023) by 14.4% . Additionally, they improve accuracy over baselines by 25.9% and13.2% on
GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and GSM-Hard (Gao et al., 2023) math tasks, respectively, after trans-
ferring across domains. The promising performance of our algorithm over hand-designed solutions
illustrates the potential of ADAS in automating the design of agentic systems. Furthermore, the
experiments demonstrate that the discovered agents not only perform well when transferring across
similar domains but also exhibit strong performance when transferring across dissimilar domains,
such as from mathematics to reading comprehension. This highlights the robustness and transfer-
ability of the agentic systems discovered by Meta Agent Search. In conclusion, our work opens up
many exciting research directions and encourages further studies (Section 6).

search space determines which agentic systems can be represented in ADAS. The search algorithm
specifies how the ADAS method explores the search space. The evaluation function defines how to
evaluate a candidate agent on target objectives such as performance.
At the time of writing, the community has not reached a consensus on the definitions or terminolo-
gies of agents. Here, by agents we refer to agentic systems that involve Foundation Models (FMs) as
modules in the workflow to solve tasks by planning, using tools, and carrying out multiple, iterative
steps of processing (Chase, 2024; Ng, 2024). In this paper, we describe a newly forming research
area Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS). Similar to research areas in AI-GAs (Clune,
2019) and AutoML (Hutter et al., 2019), such as Neural Architecture Search (Elsken et al., 2019), we
formulate ADAS as an optimization process and identify three key components of ADAS algorithms
(Figure 2).

•Search Space : The search space defines which agentic systems can be represented and thus
discovered in ADAS. For example, works like PromptBreeder (Fernando et al., 2024) mutate
only the text prompts of an agent, but their other components, such as workflow, remain the same.
Thus, in these search spaces, agents that have a different workflow than the predefined one can not
be represented. Existing works also explore search spaces such as graph structures (Zhuge et al.,
2024) and feed-forward networks (Liu et al., 2023).
•Search Algorithm : The search algorithm defines how ADAS algorithms explore the search space.
Since the search space is often very large or even unbounded, the exploration-exploitation trade-
off (Sutton & Barto, 2018) should be considered. Ideally, the algorithm can both quickly discover
high-performance agentic systems and avoid remaining stuck in a local optimum. Existing ap-
proaches include using Reinforcement Learning (Zhuge et al., 2024) or an FM iteratively gener-
ating new solutions (Fernando et al., 2024) as search algorithms.
•Evaluation Function : Depending on the application of the ADAS algorithm, we may consider
different objectives to optimize, such as performance, cost, latency, or safety of agents. An eval-
uation function defines how to evaluate a candidate agent on those objectives. For example, to
assess the agent’s performance on unseen future data, a simple method is to calculate the accuracy
rate on the validation data for a task, which is commonly adopted in existing works (Zhuge et al.,
2024; Fernando et al., 2024).
Although many search space designs are possible and some have already been explored (Section 5),
there is an unexplored yet promising approach where we can define the entire agentic system in
code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones
in code. Searching within a code space theoretically enables the ADAS algorithm to discover any
possible building blocks (e.g., prompts, tool use, workflow) and agentic systems that combine any
of these building blocks in any way. This approach also offers better interpretability for agent design
patterns since the program code is often readable, making debugging easier and enhancing AI safety.
Additionally, compared to search spaces using networks (Liu et al., 2023) or graphs (Zhuge et al.,
2024), searching in a code space allows us to more easily build on existing human efforts. For ex-
ample, it is possible to search within open-source agent frameworks like LangChain (LangChainAI,
2022) and build upon all existing building blocks (e.g., RAG, search engine tools). Finally, since
FMs are proficient in coding, utilizing a code search space allows us to leverage existing expertise
from FMs during the search process. In contrast, search algorithms in custom search spaces, such as
graphs, may be much less efficient due to the absence of these priors. Therefore, we argue that the
approach of using programming languages as the search space should be studied more in ADAS.
3 O URALGORITHM : M ETA AGENT SEARCH
In this section, we present Meta Agent Search, a simple yet effective algorithm to demonstrate the
approach of defining and searching for agents in code. The core idea of Meta Agent Search is to
adopt FMs as meta agents to iteratively program interestingly new agents based on an ever-growing
archive of previous discoveries. Although any possible building blocks and agentic systems can
theoretically be programmed by the meta agent from scratch, it is inefficient in practice to avoid
providing the meta agent any basic functions such as FM query APIs or existing tools. Therefore,
in this paper, we define a simple framework (within 100 lines of code) for the meta agent, providing
it with a basic set of essential functions like querying FMs or formatting prompts. As a result, the
meta agent only needs to program a “forward” function to define a new agentic system, similar to
the practice in FunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024). This function takes in the information of
the task and outputs the agent’s response to the task. Details of the framework codes and examples
of the agents defined with this framework can be found in Appendix C.
As shown in Figure 1, the core idea of Meta Agent Search is to have a meta agent iteratively program
new agents in code. The algorithm proceeds as follows: (1) The archive is (optionally) initialized
with baseline agents such as Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) and Self-Refine (Madaan et al.,
2024; Shinn et al., 2023). (2) Conditioned on the archive, the meta agent designs a new agent by
generating a high-level description of the new idea for an agentic system and then implementing it in
code. The design then undergoes two self-reflection (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023) steps by
the meta agent to ensure it is novel. (3) The generated agent is evaluated using validation data from
the target domain. If errors occur during evaluation, the meta agent performs a self-reflection step to
4

refine the design, repeating this process up to five times if necessary. (4) Finally, the agent is added
to the archive along with its evaluation metrics, and the process continues with the updated archive
until the maximum number of iterations is reached. A pseudocode of the algorithm is provided in
Appendix H.
Similar to existing open-endedness algorithms that leverage human notions of interesting-
ness (Zhang et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024c), we encourage the meta agent to explore interestingly
new (e.g., novel or worthwhile) agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries.
Here, we calculate the performance (e.g., success rate or F1 score) as the metrics for the meta agent
to maximize. The prompt and more details are presented in Appendix B.
4 E XPERIMENTS
We conduct extensive experiments on: (1) the ARC challenge (Chollet, 2019) (Section 4.1), (2) four
popular benchmarks assessing the agent’s abilities on reading comprehension, math, science ques-
tions, and multi-task problem solving (Section 4.2), and (3) the transferability of discovered agents
on math to held-out math tasks and non-math tasks (Section 4.3). We use an identical implemen-
tation of the algorithm across different tasks, with the only variation being task-specific descriptive
text included in the prompt (details are available in Appendix B). Across all experiments, we find
that the discovered agents substantially outperform baseline state-of-the-art hand-designed agents
and maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models.

We first demonstrate how Meta Agent Search discovers novel agentic systems and outperforms ex-
isting state-of-the-art hand-designed agents in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) chal-
lenge (Chollet, 2019). This challenge aims to evaluate the general intelligence of AI systems through
their ability to acquire new skills. Questions in ARC include (1) showing multiple examples of vi-
sual input-output grid patterns, (2) the AI system learning the transformation rule of grid patterns
from examples, and (3) predicting the output grid pattern given a test input grid pattern. Since each
question in ARC has a unique transformation rule, it requires the AI system to learn efficiently with
few-shot examples, leveraging capabilities in number counting, geometry, and topology.

Setup. Following common practice (Greenblatt, 2024), we require the agent to write code for the
transformation rule instead of answering directly. We provide tool functions in the framework (de-
scribed in Section 3) that evaluate the generated transformation code. Given the significant challenge
that ARC poses to current AI systems, we sample our data from questions with grid dimensions
≤5×5in the “Public Training Set (Easy)”. We sample a validation set and a test set with 20 and
60 questions, respectively, for searching and testing. We calculate the validation and test accuracy
of an agent by assessing it over the validation and test sets five times to reduce the variance from the
stochastic sampling of FMs. We evaluate all discovered agents on the held-out test set and report
the test accuracy in Figure 3. Meta Agent Search runs for 25 iterations and the meta agent uses
GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024), while discovered agents and baselines are evaluated using GPT-3.5 (Ope-
nAI, 2022) to reduce compute cost. More algorithmic details and examples of ARC questions can
be found in Appendix D.
Baselines. We compared against five state-of-the-art hand-designed agents: (1) Chain-of-Thought
(COT, Wei et al. (2022)), which instructs the agent to output the reasoning before answering to
improve complex problem-solving through intermediate steps; (2) Self-Consistency with Chain-of-
Thought (COT-SC, Wang et al. (2023b)), which ensembles multiple parallel answers from COT to
produce a more accurate answer; (3) Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023), which
allows iterative self-reflection to correct mistakes made in previous attempts; (4) LLM-Debate (Du
et al., 2023), which enables different LLMs to debate with each other, leveraging diverse perspec-
tives to find better answers; (5) Quality-Diversity, a simplified version of Intelligent Go-Explore (Lu
et al., 2024c), which produces and ensembles diverse answers to better explore potential solutions.
The selected baselines represent widely adopted agent designs in the agent literature, embodying
key design patterns and approaches frequently utilized across various applications. By “state-of-
the-art,” we refer to these baseline designs as exemplifying important advancements and practices
within the field. We also use all baselines as initial seeds in the archive for Meta Agent Search, with
additional results for empty initialization provided in Appendix I. To ensure fair comparisons, all
baseline implementations were developed using the same framework as the Meta Agent, providing
a consistent and equitable evaluation environment. More details about baselines can be found in
Appendix F.
Results and Analysis. As shown in Figure 3a, Meta Agent Search effectively and progressively
discovers agents that perform better than state-of-the-art hand-designed baselines. Important break-
throughs are highlighted in the text boxes. As is critical in prior works on open-endedness and
AI-GAs (Zhang et al., 2024a; Faldor et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2019; 2020; Lehman & Stanley,
2011), Meta Agent Search innovates based on a growing archive of previous stepping stones. For
example, an important design pattern emerged in iteration 3 where it uses multiple COTs to gener-
ate possible answers, refines them, and finally ensembles the best answers. This became a crucial
stepping stone that subsequent designs tended to utilize. Additionally, the best-discovered agent is
shown in Figure 3b, where a complex feedback mechanism is adopted to refine answers more effec-
tively. Careful observation of the search progress reveals that this sophisticated feedback mechanism
did not appear suddenly. Instead, the ideas of incorporating diverse feedback, evaluating for various
specific traits (via experts) such as efficiency and simplicity, and simulating human-like feedback
emerged in iterations 5, 11, and 12, respectively. The final mechanism is an innovation based on
these three stepping stones. This illustrates that even though these stepping stones did not achieve
high performance immediately upon emergence, later discoveries benefited from these innovations
by combining different stepping stones, resembling crossover in evolution via LLMs (Meyerson
et al., 2023). Overall, the results showcase the potential of ADAS and the effectiveness of Meta
Agent Search to progressively discover agents that outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed base-
lines and invent novel design patterns through the innovation and combination of stepping stones.
4.2 R EASONING AND PROBLEM -SOLVING DOMAINS
Setup. Next, we investigate the potential of our algorithm to improve the capabilities of agents
across math, reading, and reasoning domains. We test Meta Agent Search on four popular bench-
marks: (1) DROP (Dua et al., 2019) for evaluating Reading Comprehension ; (2) MGSM (Shi et al.,
2023) for evaluating Math capability under a multi-lingual setting; (3) MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,
2021) for evaluating Multi-task Problem Solving; and (4) GPQA (Rein et al., 2023) for evaluating
the capability of solving hard (graduate-level) questions in Science . The search is conducted inde-
pendently within each domain. Meta Agent Search runs for 30 iterations. The meta agent uses GPT-

4 (OpenAI, 2024), while the discovered agents and baselines are evaluated using GPT-3.5 (OpenAI,
2022). More details about datasets and experiment settings can be found in Appendix E.
Baselines. We adopt all baselines introduced in Section 4.1. Additionally, since the above do-
mains require strong reasoning skills, we include two additional baselines that specifically focus
on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of agents for a more thorough comparison: (1) Step-back
Abstraction (Zheng et al., 2023), which instructs agents to first consider the principles involved in
solving the task for better reasoning; (2) Role Assignment (Xu et al., 2023), which assigns different
roles to FMs to obtain better answers. Furthermore, we compare our approach with the state-of-the-
art prompt optimization baseline OPRO (Yang et al., 2024) to highlight the advantages of learning
all possible components of agents rather than focusing solely on prompts. More details about the
baselines can be found in Appendix F.
Table 1: Performance comparison between Meta Agent Search and state-of-the-art hand-
designed agents across multiple domains. Meta Agent Search discovers superior agents compared
to the baselines in every domain. We report the test accuracy and the 95% bootstrap confidence in-
terval on held-out test sets. The search is conducted independently for each domain. Here, and in all
tables below, we bold the entry with the highest performance for each domain, as well as all entries
whose median falls within the 95% confidence interval of the highest-performing treatment.

Results and Analysis. The results across multiple domains demonstrate that Meta Agent Search
can discover agents that outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents (Table 1). We want to
highlight the substantial gap between the learned agents and hand-designed agents in the Reading
Comprehension and Math domains, with improvements in F1 scores by 13.6/100 and accuracy rates
by14.4% , respectively. While Meta Agent Search also outperforms baselines in the Multi-task and
Science domains, the gap is smaller. We hypothesize that for challenging questions in the Science
and Multi-task domains, the knowledge in FMs is not sufficient to solve the questions, limiting the
improvement through optimizing agentic systems, which is a problem that will diminish as FMs
improve. In contrast, in the Reading Comprehension and Math domains, FMs possess adequate
knowledge to solve the questions, and errors could mainly be hallucinations or calculation mistakes,
which can be mitigated through well-designed agentic systems, like the ones discovered by Meta
Agent Search. Additionally, when compared to prompt optimization methods, the results demon-
strate that our proposed Meta Agent Search consistently outperforms them across all domains. This
comparison further strengthens our argument that defining agents in code and enabling the learning","Researchers are working on building powerful AI systems that can perform a wide variety of tasks, using large language models called Foundation Models as building blocks. However, the history of machine learning shows that hand-designed solutions often get replaced by solutions that the system learns on its own. To address this, the researchers propose a new research direction called Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS). The goal of ADAS is to automatically create powerful AI systems, including discovering new types of building blocks or combining existing ones in novel ways. One promising but unexplored approach within ADAS is to define the AI agents in computer code, and then have a ""meta agent"" automatically discover new and better agents by programming them in code. This is possible because programming languages are Turing complete , meaning they can represent any possible computation. By taking this code-based approach, the researchers believe they can automatically invent AI agents with completely new capabilities, such as using tools in unique ways, following complex control flows, or combining multiple skills in novel ways. The key idea is to let the meta agent iteratively program better and better agents, rather than hand-designing them."

Abstract
Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers
have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of
their hidden states. We present a practical framework for instantiating sequence modeling layers
with linear complexity and expressive hidden states. The key idea is to make the hidden state a
machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the
hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training
(TTT) layers . We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a
linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M
to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Similar to
Transformer, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more
tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O,
but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.

Figure 1. All sequence modeling layers can be expressed as a hidden state that transitions according to an

gradient step on the self-supervised loss ℓ. Therefore, updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent
to training the model fat test time. This process, known as Test-Time Training (TTT), is programmed into our
TTT layers.

All methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B.
1 Introduction
In 2020, the OpenAI scaling law paper (Kaplan et. al [ 36]) showed that LSTMs (a type of RNN)
could not scale similarly to Transformers or e ffectively use long context. Now, with modern RNNs
and best practices, we re-evaluate these findings in Figure 2.
On the left, we observe that Mamba [ 25] – one of the most popular RNNs today – scales similarly to
a strong Transformer, showing great progress since the LSTMs in 2020. However, on the right, we
observe the same issue with Mamba as Kaplan et al. did with LSTMs. Tokens later in a sequence
should be easier to predict on average, since they condition on more information. This is indeed the
case for Transformer, whose average perplexity at each token index decreases throughout its 32k
context. In contrast, the same metric plateaus for Mamba after 16k.
This result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of
RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only
realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 12 is after 8k. On the other hand,
once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of
the extra information being conditioned on.
The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention,
RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,
the update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or
potentially millions of tokens. This need is inherently challenging. In this paper, we begin with the
observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a
model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections
among its training data – exactly what we need from a compression heuristic.
TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we make the hidden state a machine learning model
itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by
training even on test sequences, these RNN layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers . We
introduce two simple instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear
model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture
and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention.

figure: the initial state, update rule and output rule. Bottom : Examples of sequence modeling layers and their
instantiations of the three components. The naive TTT layer was shown in Figure 1. Self-attention has a hidden
state growing with context, therefore growing cost per token. Both the naive RNN and TTT layer compress the
growing context into a hidden state of fixed size, therefore their cost per token stays constant.
Wall-clock time. We apply two techniques to make TTT layers more e fficient on modern GPUs and
TPUs. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences
during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second,
we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch. The dual form is equivalent in
output to the naive implementation, but trains more than 5 ×faster on our TPUs.
Contributions and limitations. The idea of using linear models as hidden states has already been
well studied in DeltaNet [ 55,75]. Since our first version was released, RNN layers with matrix
(linear) hidden states have also been further advanced in Mamba 2 [ 17] and Gated DeltaNet [ 74].
Compared to this line of work, our contribution is a practical framework that can instantiate
arbitrary neural networks as hidden states. However, such instantiations can still require substantial
wall-clock time, even after applying our improvements in e fficiency. It remains to be seen whether
our framework can produce instantiations that either overcome this limitation or o ffer benefits
outweighing it.
2 Method
All sequence modeling layers can be viewed from the perspective of storing historic context into
a hidden state, as shown in Figure 3.1For example, RNN layers – such as LSTM [ 31], RWKV [ 52]
and Mamba [ 25] layers – compress context into a state of fixed size across time. This compression
has two consequences. On one hand, mapping an input token xtto output token ztis efficient,
because both the update rule and output rule take constant time per token. On the other hand, the
performance of RNN layers in long context is limited by the expressive power of its hidden state st.
Self-attention can also be viewed from the perspective above, except that its hidden state, commonly
known as the Key-Value (KV) cache, is a list that grows linearly with t. Its update rule simply
appends the current KV tuple to this list, and the output rule scans over all tuples up to tto form
1We define a sequence modeling layer as an autoregressive mapping from one sequence to another.

the attention matrix. The hidden state explicitly stores all historic context without compression,
making self-attention more expressive than RNN layers for long context. However, scanning this
linearly growing hidden state also takes linearly growing time per token.
To remain both e fficient and expressive in long context, we need a better compression heuristic.
Specifically, we need to compress thousands or potentially millions of tokens into a hidden state
that can e ffectively capture their underlying structures and relationships. This might sound like a
tall order, but all of us are actually already familiar with such a heuristic.
2.1 TTT as updating a hidden state
The process of parametric learning can be viewed as compressing a massive training set into the
weights of a model. Specifically, we know that models trained with self-supervision can capture the
underlying structures and relationships behind their training data [ 44] – exactly what we need from
a compression heuristic.
LLMs themselves are great examples. Trained with the self-supervised task of next-token prediction,
their weights can be viewed as a compressed form of storage for existing knowledge on the internet.
By querying LLMs, we can extract knowledge from their weights. More importantly, LLMs often
exhibit a deep understanding of the semantic connections among existing knowledge to express
new pieces of reasoning [1].
Our key idea is to use self-supervised learning to compress the historic context x1,...,xtinto a
hidden state st, by making the context an unlabeled dataset and the state a model. Concretely, the
hidden state stis now equivalent to Wt, the weights of a model f, which can be a linear model, a
small neural network, or anything else. The output rule is simply:
zt=f(xt;Wt). (1)
Intuitively, the output token is just the prediction on xt, made byfwith the updated weights Wt.
The update rule is a step of gradient descent on some self-supervised loss ℓ:
Wt=Wt−1−η∇ℓ(Wt−1;xt), (2)
with learning rate η.2From the compression point of view, every heuristic needs to decide which
input to remember or forget. Our Wremembers inputs that produce large gradients – intuitively,
inputs that make Wlearn a lot.
One choice of ℓis reconstructing xtitself. To make the learning problem nontrivial, we first process
xtinto a corrupted input ˜xt(details in Subsection 2.3), then optimize:
ℓ(W;xt) =∥f(˜xt;W)−xt∥2. (3)
Similar to denoising autoencoders [ 70],fneeds to discover the correlations between dimensions of
xtin order to reconstruct it from partial information ˜xt.3As shown in Figure 4, gradient descent is
able to reduce ℓ, but cannot reduce it to zero. We discuss more sophisticated formulations of the
self-supervised task in Subsection 2.3.
As with other RNN layers and self-attention, our algorithm that maps an input sequence x1,...,xTto
output sequence z1,...,zTcan be programmed into the forward pass of a sequence modeling layer,
using the hidden state, update rule, and output rule above. Even at test time, our new layer still
trains a di fferent sequence of weights W1,...,WTfor every input sequence. Therefore, we call it the
Test-Time Training (TTT) layer .
2For now, consider W0= 0. We will discuss more sophisticated techniques for initializing Win Subsection 2.7.
3In past experiments, we have also tried adding another model g(decoder) after f(encoder), such that the reconstruction
is produced by g◦finstead of only fitself. While this heftier design did slightly improve results, it made overall training
less stable and added significant computational cost. Therefore we focus on the encoder-only design.

further from ℓ(W0;xt). For visual clarity, loss values have been averaged over a sliding window of 10 timesteps.
See Figure 14 (in Appendix) for complete results on all 12 layers.
2.2 Training a network with TTT layers
The forward pass of a TTT layer also has a corresponding backward pass. Our forward pass only
consists of standard di fferentiable operators except the gradient operator ∇. However,∇just maps
one function to another, in this case ℓto∇ℓ, and∇ℓis also composed of di fferentiable operators.
Conceptually, calling backward on ∇ℓmeans taking gradients of gradients – a well explored
technique in meta-learning [47].
TTT layers have the same interface as RNN layers and self-attention, therefore can be replaced in
any larger network architecture, which usually contains many of these sequence modeling layers.
Training a network with TTT layers also works the same way as training any other language model,
such as a Transformer. The same data, recipe, and objective such as next-token prediction can be
used to optimize parameters of the rest of the network.
We refer to training the larger network as the outer loop , and training Wwithin each TTT layer
as the inner loop . An important di fference between the two nested learning problems is that the
inner-loop gradient ∇ℓis taken w.r.t. W, the parameters of f, while the outer-loop gradient is taken
w.r.t the parameters of the rest of the network, which we will denote by θrest. Throughout this paper,
outer-loop parameters are always denoted by θwith various subscripts.
So far, the TTT layer has no outer-loop parameters, in contrast to other RNN layers and self-attention.
In Subsection 2.3, we add outer-loop parameters to the TTT layer to improve its self-supervised task.
Then in Subsection 2.4 and 2.5, we discuss two ways to improve the wall-clock time of TTT layers.
2.3 Learning a self-supervised task for TTT
Arguably the most important part of TTT is the self-supervised task, because it determines the kind
of features that Wwill learn from the test sequence. So how should we design this task? The final
goal of TTT is for zt=f(xt;Wt)to perform well on language modeling. Instead of handcrafting a
self-supervised task from human priors, we take a more end-to-end approach – directly optimizing
the self-supervised task for the final goal of next-token prediction.
Concretely, we learn the self-supervised task as part of the outer loop. Starting from the naive
reconstruction task in Equation 3, we add some outer-loop parameters to make this task learnable.
In Subsection 2.1, we did not specify the corruption that produces ˜xtfromxt. One design is to make
it a low-rank projection ˜xt=θKxt, whereθKis a learnable matrix.4Following the terminology of
multi-view reconstruction, θKxtis called a training view [13].

TTT_Layer can be dropped into a larger network like other sequence modeling layers. Training the network will
optimize the parameters of Task inTTT_Layer , because both are subclasses of nn.Module . Since Learner is
not a subclass of nn.Module ,state.model is updated manually in the inner loop for each call of state.train .
For simplicity, we sometimes overload model asmodel.parameters .
Moreover, perhaps not all the information in xtis worth remembering, so the reconstruction label
can be another low-rank projection θVxtinstead ofxt. HereθVxtis called the label view , whereθV
is also learnable. In summary, our new self-supervised loss is:
ℓ(W;xt) =f(θKxt;W)−θVxt2. (4)
Since bothWand various θs appear together in Equation 4, we emphasize again their di fference
in nature. In the inner loop, only Wis optimized, therefore written as an argument of ℓ; theθs
are ""hyper-parameters"" of this loss function. In the outer loop, θK,θV,θQare optimized alongside
θrest, andWis merely a hidden state, not a parameter. Figure 5 illustrates this di fference with code,
whereθKandθVare implemented as parameters of the TTT layer, analogous to the Key and Value
parameters of self-attention.
Lastly, the training view θKxthas fewer dimensions than xt, so we can no longer use the output rule
in Equation 1. The simplest solution is to create a test viewθQxt, and change our output rule to:
zt=f
θQxt;Wt
. (5)
This solution has an additional benefit. The training and label views specify the information in xt
that is compressed into Wtand propagated forward through time. The test view specifies potentially
different information that is mapped to the current output token ztand propagated forward through
network layers, therefore adds more flexibility to the self-supervised task.
Altogether, the set of all possible choices for θK,θQ,θVinduces a family of multi-view reconstruction
tasks, and the outer loop can be interpreted as selecting a task from this family. Here we have
designed all views as linear projections for simplicity. Future work might experiment with more
flexible transformations, or bigger and di fferent families of self-supervised tasks.

computations. The blue nodes are input variables, and yellow are output. Subsection 2.4 : SinceG1,...,Gb
are not connected, they have no sequential dependency on each other, therefore can be computed in parallel.
Subsection 2.5 : We do not actually materialize the white nodes – the intermediate Gs andWs – to compute the

2.4 Parallelization with mini-batch TTT
The naive TTT layer developed so far is already e fficient in the number of floating point operations
(FLOPs). However, its update rule Wt=Wt−1−η∇l(Wt−1;xt)cannot be parallelized, because Wt
depends on Wt−1in two places: before the minus sign and inside ∇l. Since∇lcontains the bulk of
the computation, we focus on making this second part parallel.
We approach this systems challenge through concepts in the TTT framework. There are many
variants of gradient descent (GD). The general update rule of GD can be expressed as:
Wt=Wt−1−ηGt=W0−ηtX
s=1Gs, (6)
whereGtis the descent direction. Note that once we have calculated Gtfort= 1,...,T , we can then
obtain all the Wts through a cumsum by the second half of Equation 6. Our naive update rule, known
asonline gradient descent , usesGt=∇l(Wt−1;xt).
To parallelize Gtfort= 1,...,T , we can take all of them w.r.t. W0. This variant with Gt=∇ℓ(W0;xt)
is known as batch gradient descent , sincePt
s=1∇ℓ(W0;xs)is the same as the gradient w.r.t. W0over
x1,...,xtas a batch. However, in batch GD, Wtis effectively only one gradient step away from W0,
in contrast to online GD, where Wtiststeps away from W0. Therefore, batch GD has a smaller
effective search space, which ends up hurting performance for language modeling.
Our proposed solution – mini-batch gradient descent – is shown in Figure 6. Denote the TTT batch size
byb. We useGt=∇ℓ(Wt′;xt), wheret′=t−mod(t,b)is the last timestep of the previous mini-batch
(or 0 for the first mini-batch), so we can parallelize bgradient computations at a time. Empirically,
bcontrols a trade-o ffbetween speed and quality, as shown in Figure 7. We chose b= 16 for all
experiments in this paper.
In summary, there are two potential channels to propagate information from WstoWtwheres<t:
cumsum and the gradient operator. The cumsum is always active, but the gradient channel is only
active when Wsis from a previous mini-batch. Di fferent variants of gradient descent only a ffect the
gradient channel, i.e., the descent direction Gt, specifically w.r.t. which Wthe gradient is taken.
However, the descent step Wt=Wt−1−ηGtalways starts from Wt−1, due to the autoregressive nature
of the update rule, which is orthogonal to the choice of Gt.

perplexity of 11.09 at b= 16 corresponds to the final result of TTT-Linear in Figure 10. Right : Forward time in
dual form, with context length T= 2048 . Total time (orange) can be decomposed into time for computing the
Ws at the end of every mini-batch (blue) and time for z1,...,zT(orange−blue).6Time complexity for the Ws
isO(T×d2), constant in b, but the blue line decreases as larger ballows more parallelization until hardware
utilization saturates. Time complexity for z1,...,zTisO(T×b×d), so the orange line first decreases with more
parallelization, then increases as the extra computation for z1,...,zTbecomes dominant.
2.5 Dual form
The parallelization introduced above is necessary but not su fficient for e fficiency in wall-clock time.
Modern accelerators specialize in matrix-matrix multiplications, known as matmul s. For example,
the NVIDIA A100 GPU contains highly optimized units called TensorCores that can only perform a
single operation – multiplying two matrices each of size 16×16. Without enough of these matmul s,
the TensorCores are idle, and most of the potential for the A100 is unrealized.
Unfortunately, the TTT layer developed so far even with mini-batch still has very few matmul s.
Consider the simplest case of ℓ, whereθK=θV=θQ=I, for only the first TTT mini-batch of size b.
In addition, consider fas a linear model. Copying Equation 3, our loss at time tis:
ℓ(W0;xt)=∥f(xt;W0)−xt∥2=∥W0xt−xt∥2.
As discussed in Subsection 2.4, we can parallelize the computation of:
Gt=∇ℓ(W0;xt)= 2(W0xt−xt)xT
t,
fort= 1,...,b . However, we cannot compute all bof theGts through a single matmul . Instead, we
needbouter products to compute them one by one. To make matters worse, for each xt∈Rd,Gtis
d×d, which incurs much heavier memory footprint and I/O cost than xtfor larged.
To solve these two problems, we make a simple observation: We do not actually need to materialize
G1,...,Gbas long as we can compute Wbat the end of the mini-batch, and the output tokens z1,...,zb
(see Figure 6). Now we demonstrate these computations with the simplified TTT-Linear case above.
DenoteX= [x1,...,xb], then:
Wb=W0−ηbX
t=1Gt=W0−2ηbX
t=1(W0xt−xt)xT
t=W0−2η(W0X−X)XT.
5In theory,bcan potentially be too small such that the variance between mini-batches is too high, hurting optimization.
However, we have not observed such an e ffect in practice.
6For Figure 7, we use a single TTT layer in TTT-Linear 1.3B, implemented in pure PyTorch. Our fused kernel significantly
improves time e fficiency, but makes it di fficult to cleanly decompose the time for computing Wbvs.z1,...,zb.

uniquely induces a TTT layer (right). Two of the induced TTT layers: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, are proposed
in this paper. The TTT layer with a linear model and batch GD is equivalent to linear attention [37].
SoWbcan be conveniently computed with a matmul . To compute Z= [z1,...,zb], we know that:
zt=f(xt;Wt) =Wtxt=

s=1(W0xs−xs)xTsxtand the matrix ∆= [δ1,...,δb]. We can derive that:
∆=(W0X−X)mask
XTX
, (8)
where mask is the upper triangular mask with zeros (similar to the attention mask, but with zeros
instead of infinities), and the term W0X−Xcan be reused from the computation of Wb. Now ∆is also
conveniently computed with matmul s. Plugging ∆back into Equation 7, we obtain Z=W0X−2η∆.
We call this procedure the dual form , in contrast to the primal form before this subsection, where
theGs andWs are explicitly materialized. As discussed, the two forms are equivalent in output.
The terminology of primal and dual follows prior work that has explored similar mathematical
formulations outside of TTT [ 33,7,54]. In Appendix A, we show that the dual form still works
whenfis a neural network with nonlinear layers, except with more complicated notation.
Time complexity of the primal form within a TTT mini-batch is O(b×d2). Time complexity of the
dual form is O(b×d2)for computing Wbalone, then an additional O(b2×d)for computing z1,...,zb.
Compared to the primal, the dual form sacrifices theoretical complexity for hardware utilization. In
practice,dis typically a few hundred and bis chosen to be only 16. As a consequence, wall-clock
time for computing z1,...,zbis relatively small, as observed in the right panel of Figure 7. In our
JAX implementation, training with the dual form is more than 5 ×faster than with primal.
2.6 Theoretical equivalences
In Subsection 2.1, we mentioned that fcan be a linear model or a neural network. In Subsection 2.4,
we also discussed three variants of the update rule: online GD, batch GD, and mini-batch GD.
Each of these 2×3combinations induces a di fferent instantiation of the TTT layer, as illustrated in
Figure 8. We now show that among these induced instantiations, the TTT layer with a linear model
and batch GD is equivalent to linear attention [37], a widely known RNN layer.7
7In a nutshell, linear attention [ 37] is simply self-attention without the softmax. Recall the definition of self-attention:
zt=Vtsoftmax
KT
tqt
. Without softmax , this becomes zt=Vt
KT
tqt
=Pt
s=1vskTsqt, which is the simplest formulation of
linear attention. Similar to other RNN layers, it can be written in a recurrent form, wherePt
s=1vskTsis the hidden state.
SincePt
s=1vskTscan be computed in a cumsum for everyt= 1,...,T , linear attention also has linear complexity w.r.t. T.

RNN layers have a hidden state that is

parametric learners are also RNN layers,
since their hidden state is also fixed in size.
TTT layers with nonparametric learners
can represent self-attention, as discussed
in Subsection 2.6.
Theorem 1. Consider the TTT layer with f(x) =Wxas the inner-loop model, batch gradient descent with
η= 1/2as the update rule, and W0= 0. Then, given the same input sequence x1,...,xT, the output rule
defined in Equation 5 produces the same output sequence z1,...,zTas linear attention.
Proof. By definition of ℓin Equation 4,∇ℓ(W0;xt)=−2(θVxt)(θKxt)T. By definition of batch GD in
Equation 6 :
Wt=Wt−1−η∇ℓ(W0;xt)=W0−ηtX
s=1∇ℓ(W0;xs)=tX
s=1(θVxs)(θKxs)T.
PluggingWtinto the output rule in Equation 5, we obtain the output token:
zt=f
θQxt;Wt
=tX
s=1(θVxs)(θKxs)T(θQxt),
which is the definition of linear attention.
In Table 1, we first empirically verify the equivalence above with an improved implementation of
linear attention.8Then, to illustrate the contribution of each of our components (including some
that will be introduced in the next subsection), we add them row by row to the TTT layer that is
equivalent to linear attention, and ultimately obtain our proposed instantiation called TTT-Linear .
The change from batch GD to mini-batch GD contributes the most improvement by a large margin.
While the space of models ×optimizers in Figure 8 is already large, machine learning is much richer
than optimizing the parameters Wtof a modelf. There are also nonparametric learners, such as
nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVMs), and kernel ridge regression. By definition,
nonparametric learners do not have parameters Wt, and instead directly uses training","The paper describes a new type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called ""Learning to (Learn at Test Time)"" (LTLTT). This RNN has a special component called ""TTT layers"" that allow it to adapt and learn during the testing phase , rather than just the training phase. Typical RNNs are trained on a dataset and then used to make predictions on new data. The LTLTT model, on the other hand, can continue to learn and update its internal ""memory"" (hidden state) even when processing new, unseen data. This allows the model to perform better on tasks or datasets that are different from what it was originally trained on. The key idea is that the TTT layers enable the LTLTT model to dynamically update its hidden state in response to new inputs, rather than relying solely on its initial training. This ""learning at test time"" capability can be very useful when dealing with tasks or environments that are constantly changing or evolving."

Abstract: Structured pruning with knowledge distillation is a potent combination for obtaining small
language models (SLMs) with significantly fewer training tokens and compute resources compared to training
from scratch. In this work, we investigate how this strategy can be effectively applied in instances where
access to the the original pretraining dataset is restricted. We introduce a new teacher correction phase
before distillation which lets the teacher model adjust to our specific data distribution using a lightweight
fine-tuning phase. We apply this strategy to compress the Mistral NeMo 12B and Llama 3.1 8B models to 8B
and 4B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies:
(1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common
benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and further
tested for instruction following, role-play, math, coding and function calling capabilities. This approach
produces the state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B ( MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from
Mistral NeMo 12B, and a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B. We open-source our base model weights
on Hugging Face with a permissive license.

Introduction
LLM providers often train an entire family of models
from scratch, each with a different size (number of
parameters, e.g. Llama 3.1 with 8B, 70B, and 405B
parameters [ 1]); this is done to aid users targeting
different deployment scales, sizes and compute bud-
gets. However, training multiple billion-plus parame-
ter models from scratch is extremely time-, data- and
resource-intensive. Recent work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of combining weight pruning with
knowledge distillation to significantly reduce the cost
of training LLM model families [ 2]. Here, only the
biggest model in the family is trained from scratch;
other models are obtained by successively pruning
the bigger model(s) and then performing knowledge
distillation [ 3] to recover the accuracy of pruned mod-
els. While highly effective, this line of work assumes
access to the original pretraining dataset for the dis-
tillation phase. With a growing number of frontier
LLMs (including open ones) being trained on private,
proprietary datasets [ 1,4], this assumption often fails
to hold.
In this work, we adapt the original Minitron com-
pression recipe [ 2] along two directions: (1) we intro-

Tables 1 and 2 provide a summary of our results:
our compression strategy yield a state-of-the-art 8B

all similarly-sized models across the board on com-
mon language modeling benchmarks. Our Llama
3.1-Minitron-4B models (both depth and width-
pruned variants) also exhibit strong accuracy com-
pared to the teacher Llama 3.1 8B model and the
previous-generation Minitron-4B model [ 2]; among
the two variants, the width-pruned variant achieves
better overall accuracy than the depth-pruned one. In
terms of runtime inference performance measured us-
ing TensorRT-LLM, the Llama 3.1-Minitron-
4Bmodels provide an average speedup of 2.7 ×and
1.8×for the depth and width pruned variants, re-
spectively, compared to the original Llama 3.1 8B
model.
Methodology
A high-level overview of our approach is illustrated
in Figure 1. Here, the teacher model undergoes alightweight adjustment phase on the target dataset to
beusedfordistillation-werefertothisstepas teacher
correction . Next, pruning is applied to compress the
model, following which distillation is used to recover
model accuracy.
Teacher Correction
Distillation is an effective technique to condense
knowledge from a more accurate teacher model to
improve a less accurate student model [ 3] [2]. Typi-
cally, knowledge is distilled using the same dataset the
teacher model was trained on. In cases where access
to the original training data is restricted, we notice
from our experiments that the teacher model provides
sub-optimal guidance if a different dataset is used to
distill the knowledge. We hypothesize this is due to
the change in distribution of sub-word tokens across
the original dataset the teacher model was trained
on vs. the dataset being distilled on. To this end, we
propose a novel teacher correction phase (illustrated
in Figure 2), where we perform a lightweight ( ∼100B
tokens) fine-tuning of the teacher model to adapt to
the new distillation dataset. We demonstrate in our
experimental evaluation (Figure 4 in particular) that

this procedure significantly improves the guidance
resulting in a more accurate student model. We also
explore correcting the teacher in parallel to distilla-
tion, and demonstrate that this performs on par with
using guidance from a fully corrected teacher.
Pruning
Weight pruning is a powerful and well-known tech-
nique for reducing model size. In this work, we focus
on structured pruning, where blocks (or channels) of
nonzero elements are removed at once from model
weights; examples of structured pruning techniques
include neuron, attention head, convolutional filter,
and depth pruning [ 6,7,8,9]. We follow the pruning
recipe outlined in Minitron [ 2]: as shown in Figure 3,
we start the pruning process by first computing the
importance of each layer, neuron, head, and embed-
ding dimension. We then sort these importance scores
to compute a corresponding importance ranking.
Importance Estimation We use a purely activation-
based importance estimation strategy that simulta-
neously computes sensitivity information for all the
axes we consider (depth, neuron, head, and embed-
ding channel) using a small calibration dataset and
only forward propagation passes. We consider depth
pruning as a special case and do not combine it with
compressing other dimensions. We compute the im-
portance of each head, neuron and embedding channel
by examining the activations produced by the multi-
head attention (MHA), multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
and LayerNorm layers, respectively. We use a small
calibration dataset (1024 samples) drawn randomly
from the full dataset for this purpose.
Layer Importance For depth pruning, we consider
two distinct metrics for evaluating layer importance:
(1) LM validation loss/PPL, and (2) accuracy on the
downstream task. We do not consider the Block Im-portance (BI) metric [ 8] as it was recently shown to
under-perform the validation loss/PPL metric [ 2]. For
ranking, we simply remove a single or a block of con-
tiguous layers and compute its effect on each metric;
this serves as the “importance” or sensitivity of the
layer/layerblock. Basedonourempiricalanalysis(see
Figures 8 and 9), we use the Winogrande metric [ 10]
to prune sets of contiguous layers. This pruning strat-
egy evolved from two important observations: (1) LM
validation loss/PPL-based layer importance fails to
produce the most accurate pruned model(s) on down-
stream tasks, and (2) dropping contiguous layers is
better than individual, as also observed in Gromov
et al. [11].
Model Trimming Following Minitron [ 2], for a given
architecture configuration, we first rank the elements
of each axis according to the computed importance
and perform trimming of the corresponding weight
matrices directly. For neuron and head pruning, we
trim MLP and MHA layer weights, respectively. In
the case of embedding channels, we trim the embed-
ding dimension of the weight matrices in MLP, MHA,
and LayerNorm layers. The original approach uses
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find the best ar-
chitecture; in this work, we skip this step and instead
utilize the network architecture-related learnings from
the original paper.
Retraining with Distillation
We use the term retraining to refer to the accuracy re-
covery process post pruning. In this work, we explore
two retraining strategies: (1) conventional training,
leveraging ground truth labels, and (2) knowledge dis-
tillation using supervision from the unpruned model
(teacher). Knowledge Distillation (KD) [ 3] involves
transfer of knowledge from a larger or more com-
plex model called the teacher to a smaller/simpler

model called the student. The knowledge transfer
is achieved by having the student model mimic the
output and/or the intermediate states of the teacher
model. In our case, the uncompressed and pruned
models correspond to the teacher and student, re-
spectively. Following the best practices outlined in
the Minitron work [ 2], we use forward KL Divergence
loss [12] on the teacher and student logits only; this
is illustrated in Figure 2.
Training Details
Pre-training
Llama 3.1 8B [ 1] and Mistral NeMo 12B [ 5] are pre-
trained on different proprietary datasets, which we
do not have access to. According to the Llama 3.1
tech report [ 1], the 8B model is pretrained on 15T
tokens. We start with the corresponding Base models
that are openly available on Hugging Face.
Dataset We use the Nemotron-4 curated continued
training (CT) dataset [ 13] [14] for all our pruning
and distillation experiments.
Teacher Correction
Using the original Mistral NeMo 12B or Llama 3.1 8B
models directly as a teacher performs sub-optimally
on our dataset. To counter this, we apply teacher cor-
rection, as described in the previous section, to both
modelswith∼100𝐵tokens. Sincethegoalistoadapt
the teacher model to the distillation dataset, we use
120 steps of warm-up and low learning rates: one-fifth
the peak learning rate, identical batch size, minimum
learning rate and decay schedule the original model
was trained on. We notice that the correction process
has a minor effect on the teacher model’s accuracy
on downstream tasks, with some tasks improving andLLaMa-3.1-Minitron MN-Minitron

esize this to be an artifact of the dataset used for
fine-tuning. Optimizing this process further by using
fewer than∼100B tokens, lighter fine-tuning such as
LoRA [15] or tuning layer normalization [ 16] param-
eters alone would be an interesting topic for future
work.
Pruning
Our pruning recipe is based on the best practices
outlined in the Minitron paper [ 2], as described in the
previous section. Specifically, for width pruning, we
(1)use l2-norm andmeanastheaggregationfunctions
across the batch and sequence dimensions, respec-
tively, and (2) perform single-shot pruning, avoiding
iterative approaches. For depth pruning, we follow
the observations from Gromov et al. [11] and drop a
continuous subgroup of layers that results in the least
accuracy drop on Winogrande [ 10]. In this work, we
skip the lightweight neural architecture search (NAS)
phase, and go with a manual architecture configu-
ration for both Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B and
MN-Minitron-8B . The architectures we come up
with are inspired by the Minitron-4B and Minitron-8B
models [2], and are detailed in Table 3. We provide
the pruning recipes for each of our target compressed
models below:

Distillation
We opt for logit-only distillation, minimizing the for-
ward KL Divergence [ 12] loss across the teacher and
studentprobabilities, andignoretheLMcross-entropy
loss altogether. Here, the unpruned and pruned mod-
els correspond to the teacher and student, respectively.
We use the hyperparameters listed in Table 4 during
distillation. We use 32 NVIDIA DGX H100 nodes for
our training jobs.
Instruction Tuning
To evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of
our distilled models, we perform alignment using
NeMo-Aligner [ 17]. We follow the same recipe for
all our models by first applying math and code super-
vised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by instruction SFT
and then two rounds of Reward-aware Preference
Optimization (RPO) [18].Analysis
We perform a series of ablation studies to better un-
derstand the effects of distillation, teacher correction,
and our new depth-pruning saliency metric. We re-
port our findings in this section.
Teacher Correction We first compare the effects
of teacher correction on the MN-Minitron-8B
model in Figure 4; here, we notice the clear benefits of
performing teacher correction w.r.t. distilling directly
from an uncorrected teacher. Next, we compare two
approaches for teacher correction: (1) pruning and
distilling the corrected teacher, and (2) pruning the
original (uncorrected) teacher and distilling from a
continuously corrected teacher. The results in Fig-
ure5suggestthatteachercorrectioncanbeperformed
in parallel with distillation to recover accuracy of the
pruned student model.
Pruning and Distillation Figure 6 demonstrates
theorthogonalbenefitsofpruninganddistillationover
random initialization and conventional fine-tuning,
respectively. We compare (1) random weight ini-
tialization and distillation, (2) random pruning and
distillation, where weights are pruned randomly ignor-
ing the importance scores, (3) our proposed pruning
with typical cross entropy based LM loss training
and (4) our proposed pruning with distillation-based
retraining. We notice that pruning results in a sig-
nificantly better starting point compared to random
initialization, and distillation-based training outper-
forms conventional training methods. Overall, our
approach requires significantly fewer training tokens
(up to 40×; 380B instead of 15T tokens) to produce
the state-of-the-art MN-Minitron-8B model.
Width vs. Depth Pruning Figure 7 shows the
training curve of Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B
pruned for width vs. depth. We notice that width
pruning results in a lower initial loss and consistently
outperforms the depth-pruned model, despite both
variants having the same number of parameters.
Depth Pruning Metrics By examining how LM
validation loss increases as contiguous blocks of layers
are removed (Figure 8), we observe that the layers
at the beginning and end are the most important.
The figure indicates that removing non-contiguous
layers can result in even better LM validation loss
(the dashed line). However, we notice this observation
doesnotnecessarilyholdwhenevaluatingdownstream
task performance: specifically, Figure 9 shows that

dropping 16 layers selected based on per-layer impor-
tance [8,19] yields a random Winogrande accuracy of
0.5, while removing layers 16 to 31 continuously [ 11]
results in an accuracy of 0.595. The gap holds during
distillation-based retraining and we opt for the latter
approach in this work.
Evaluation
Benchmarks following Llama [ 20], we evaluate
our compressed base and aligned models on a se-
ries of downstream tasks, namely MMLU [ 21], Hu-
manEval [ 22] for Python code generation, MBPP [ 23]
and GSM8K [ 24]. We also evaluate the base models
on several question-answering datasets for common-
sense reasoning: Arc-C [ 25], HellaSwag [ 26], Truth-
fulQA [27], WinoGrande [ 10], and XL-Sum En-
glish [28] for summarization. The instruction tuned
models are further evaluated for question-answering,
function calling, instruction following and multiturn
conversations on GPQA [ 29], BFCL [ 30], IFEval [ 31]
andMT-Bench(GPT4-Turbo)[ 32], respectively. Note
that this MT-Bench is a corrected version of the orig-
inal MT-Bench [33].
For base models, accuracy is reported with the
following evaluations settings: 5-shot on MMLU, 5-
shot on Winogrande, 25-shot on ARC-Challenge, 10-
shot on HellaSwag, 0-shot on 20% of XL-Sum and
average pass@1 scores for HumanEval and MBPP. For
pass@1 scores we use a temperature of 0.2 and nucleus
sampling [ 34] with top-p =0.95. For aligned models
we use 0 shot and greedy sampling if applicable.Base Models
Base model evaluation results are shown in Ta-
ble 1. Compared to similarly-sized models, MN-
Minitron-8B demonstrates superior accuracy
across the board, outperforming the recent Llama 3.1
8B model using 40 ×fewer training tokens (380B vs.
15T). Similarly, the Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B
models perform favorably compared to the teacher
Llama 3.1 8B model using 150×fewer training to-
kens (94B vs. 15T); our pruned Llama models also
outperform the original Minitron 4B model [ 2]. We
note from Table 1 that the width-pruned Llama vari-
ant outperforms the depth-pruned one. These results
clearly demonstrate the advantages of our methodol-
ogy: state-of-the-art accuracy coupled with an order
of magnitude improvement in training efficiency.
Instruct Models
The accuracy of the instruction-tuned model variants
are shown in Table 2. Our aligned models outperform
similarlysizedvariantsonmostevaluatedbenchmarks
with the exception of HumanEval [ 35] and MBPP [ 23].
Additionally, Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B lags be-
hind Gemma2 on MT-Bench [ 33]. Nevertheless, our
aligned models are consistently better on MMLU [ 21],
GSM8K [ 24], GPQA [ 29], IFEval [ 31] and BF-
CLv2 [30]. This demonstrates the strong capabilities
of our model.

Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B
variants with NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, an open-

cases are represented by increasing input sequence

tions, at a batch size of 32 and 64 for the 8B-12B
models and the 4B models respectively. The smaller
memory footprint of the 4B model allows for larger
batches. We notice that Llama 3.1-Minitron-
4B(Depth) is fastest, achieving an average through-
put improvement of 2.7×over Llama 3.1 8B; the
width-pruned variant achieves an average throughput
improvement of 1.8×over Llama 3.1 8B. Compared
to BF16, we notice that FP8 delivers a performance
boost of 1.4×.
Insights
In this section, we summarize some interesting and
surprising observations based on our evaluation.
General
1.Teacher correction is crucial for distillation to
work optimally on a new, unseen dataset. Fine-
tuningtheteacherwiththedatasetusedfordistil-
lation in this manner yields over a 6% reduction
in LM validation loss. Teacher correction doesn’t
affect the optimality of pruning and can even be
performed in parallel with distillation.
2.InlinewiththeMinitronpaper’sobservations, we
require a order of magnitude fewer tokens (380Bvs 15T) to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy post
pruning with distillation.
3.For width pruning, we achieve stronger accuracy
by retaining attention heads and pruning the
other dimensions (MLP intermediate dimension,
embedding channels).
Mistral NeMo 12B to MN-Minitron-8B
1.Our compressed model outperforms the teacher
on two benchmarks, GSM8k and HumanEval
after pruning and distillation: GSM8k increases
from 55.7% to 58.5% and HumanEval increases
from 23.8% to 36.2%. This improvement is likely
influenced by the dataset. However, retraining is
performed using the distillation loss alone.
Llama 3.1 8B to Llama 3.1-Minitron-4B
1.Width pruning delivers better accuracy with
MMLU at 60.5%, while depth pruning yields
58.7%, for Llama 3.1 compression.
2.Reasoning ability for base variants appears to
be impacted significantly for the depth pruned
version, with GSM8K accuracy at 16.8% com-
pared to 41.24% for the width pruned version.
However, the gap reduces with instruct tuning.
3.Depth pruning boosts throughput, achieving
2.7×speedup over Llama-3.1 8B, while width
pruning provides 1.7×speedup.
4.For depth pruning, we observe that dropping
contiguous layers from the model is more ef-
fective than using non-contiguous, importance-
based pruning.

ABSTRACT
Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work,
we introduce DIFFTransformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context
while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates
attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps.
The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention pat-
terns. Experimental results on language modeling show that DIFFTransformer
outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training
tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications,
such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation,
in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted
by irrelevant context, DIFFTransformer can mitigate hallucination in question
answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, DIFFTransformer not
only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was
considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position DIFFTransformer as
a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has garnered significant research interest in recent years, with the
decoder-only Transformer emerging as the de facto standard for large language models (LLMs). At
the heart of Transformer is the attention mechanism, which employs the softmax function to weigh
the importance of various tokens in a sequence. However, recent studies (Kamradt, 2023; Liu et al.,
2024b) show that LLMs face challenges in accurately retrieving key information from context.
As illustrated on the left side of Figure 1, we visualize the normalized attention scores assigned to
different parts of the context by a Transformer. The task is to retrieve an answer embedded in the
middle of a pile of documents. The visualization reveals that Transformer tends to allocate only
a small proportion of attention scores to the correct answer, while disproportionately focusing on
irrelevant context. The experiments in Section 3 further substantiate that Transformers struggle with
such capabilities. The issue arises from non-negligible attention scores assigned to irrelevant context,
which ultimately drowns out the correct answer. We term these extraneous scores as attention noise .

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025
In this paper, we introduce Differential Transformer (a.k.a. DIFFTransformer), a foundation architec-
ture for large language models. The differential attention mechanism is proposed to cancel attention
noise with differential denoising. Specifically, we partition the query and key vectors into two groups
and compute two separate softmax attention maps. Then the result of subtracting these two maps
is regarded as attention scores. The differential attention mechanism eliminates attention noise,
encouraging models to focus on critical information. The approach is analogous to noise-canceling
headphones and differential amplifiers (Laplante et al., 2018) in electrical engineering, where the
difference between two signals cancels out common-mode noise. In the middle of Figure 1, we
also present the normalized distribution of attention scores for DIFFTransformer. We observe that
DIFFTransformer assigns significantly higher scores to the correct answer and much lower scores
to irrelevant context compared to Transformer. The right side of Figure 1 shows that the proposed
method achieves notable improvements in retrieval capability.
We conduct extensive experiments on language modeling. We scale up DIFFTransformer in terms
of parameter count, training tokens, and context length. The scaling curves indicate that DIFF
Transformer requires only about 65% of model size or training tokens needed by Transformer to
achieve comparable language modeling performance. Moreover, DIFFTransformer outperforms
Transformer in various downstream tasks. The long-sequence evaluation also shows that DIFF
Transformer is highly effective in utilizing the increasing context. In addition, the experimental
results demonstrate that DIFFTransformer has intriguing advantages for large language models. For
example, the proposed method substantially outperforms Transformer in key information retrieval,
hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and mathematical reasoning. DIFFTransformer also
reduces outliers in model activations, which provides new opportunities for quantization. The findings
establish DIFFTransformer as an effective and distinctive foundation architecture for large language
models.
2 D IFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMER
We propose Differential Transformer (a.k.a. DIFFTransformer) as a foundation architecture for
sequence modeling, such as large language models (LLMs). We take a decoder-only model as an
example to describe the architecture. The model is stacked with LDIFFTransformer layers. Given an
input sequence x=x1···xN, we pack the input embeddings into X0= [x1,···,xN]∈RN×dmodel,
where dmodel represents the hidden dimension of the model. The input is further contextualized
to obtain the output XL, i.e., Xl= Decoder( Xl−1), l∈[1, L]. Each layer consists of two
modules: a differential attention module followed by a feed-forward network module. Compared to
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), the main difference is the replacement of conventional softmax
attention with differential attention while the macro layout is kept the same. We also adopt pre-
RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019) and SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020; Ramachandran et al., 2017) as
improvements following LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023).
2.1 D IFFERENTIAL ATTENTION
The differential attention mechanism maps query, key, and value vectors to outputs. We use query
and key vectors to compute attention scores, and then compute a weighted sum of value vectors.
The critical design is that we use a pair of softmax functions to cancel the noise of attention
scores. Specifically, given input X∈RN×dmodel, we first project them to query, key, and value

initialization of λ. We empirically find that the setting λinit= 0.8−0.6×exp(−0.3·(l−1))works

well in practice, where l∈[1, L]represents layer index. It is used as the default strategy in our
experiments. We also explore using the same λinit(e.g., 0.8) for all layers as another initialization
strategy. As shown in the ablation studies (Section 3.8), the performance is relatively robust to
different initialization strategies.
Differential attention takes the difference between two softmax attention functions to eliminate
attention noise. The idea is analogous to differential amplifiers (Laplante et al., 2018) proposed in
electrical engineering, where the difference between two signals is used as output, so that we can null
out the common-mode noise of the input. Naderi et al. (2024) also prove that differential attention
makes the spectral distribution of attention matrices more balanced, which effectively resolves rank
collapse. In addition, the design of noise-canceling headphones is based on a similar idea. We can
directly reuse FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) as described in Appendix A, which significantly
improves model efficiency.
Multi-Head Differential Attention We also use the multi-head mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017)
in Differential Transformer. Let hdenote the number of attention heads. We use different projection
matrices WQ
i, WK
i, WV
i, i∈[1, h]for the heads. The scalar λis shared between heads within the
same layer. Then the head outputs are normalized and projected to the final results as follows:
head i= DiffAttn( X;WQ
i, WK
i, WV
i, λ)
head i= (1−λinit)·LN(head i)
MultiHead( X) = Concat( head 1,···,head h)WO(3)
where λinitis the constant scalar in Equation (2), WO∈Rdmodel×dmodelis a learnable projection matrix,
LN(·)uses RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019) for each head, and Concat( ·)concatenates the
heads together along the channel dimension. We use a fixed multiplier (1−λinit)as the scale of LN(·)
to align the gradients with Transformer. Appendix G proves that the overall gradient flow remains
similar to that of Transformer. The nice property enables us to directly inherit similar hyperparameters
and ensures training stability. We set the number of heads h=dmodel/2d, where dis equal to the
head dimension of Transformer. So we can align the parameter counts and computational complexity.
Headwise Normalization Figure 2 uses GroupNorm( ·)(Wu & He, 2018) to emphasize that LN(·)
is applied to each head independently. As differential attention tends to have a sparser pattern,
statistical information is more diverse between heads. The LN(·)operator normalizes each head
before concatenation to improve gradient statistics (Wang et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2022).

The overall architecture stacks Llayers, where each layer contains a multi-head differential attention
module, and a feed-forward network module. We describe the Differential Transformer layer as:

Xl+1= SwiGLU(LN( Yl)) +Yl(5)

3 E XPERIMENTS
We evaluate Differential Transformer for large language models from the following perspectives. First,
we compare the proposed architecture with Transformers in various downstream tasks (Section 3.1)
and study the properties of scaling up model size and training tokens (Section 3.2). Second, we
conduct a length extension to 64K and evaluate the long-sequence modeling capability (Section 3.3).
Third, we present the results of key information retrieval, contextual hallucination evaluation, and
in-context learning (Sections 3.4–3.6). Forth, we show that Differential Transformer can reduce
outliers in the model activations compared to Transformer (Section 3.7). Fifth, we conduct extensive
ablation studies for various design choices (Section 3.8).
3.1 L ANGUAGE MODELING EVALUATION
We train 3B-size DIFFTransformer language models on 1T tokens and compare with previous
well-trained Transformer-based models (Geng & Liu, 2023; Tow, 2023; Tow et al., 2023) in various
downstream tasks. As described in Appendix B, we follow the same setting to train a 3B-size
Transformer language model on 350B tokens. The checkpoints are also used in the following
experiments and analysis to ensure fair comparisons.
Setup We follow a similar recipe as StableLM-3B-4E1T (Tow et al., 2023). We set hidden size
to3072 . The number of layers is 28. The head dimension dis128. The number of heads is 24for
Transformer and 12forDIFFTransformer, to align computation FLOPs and model size. The total
parameter count is about 2.8B. The training sequence length is 4096. The batch size is 4M tokens.
We train the models with 1T tokens. We use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) optimizer with
β= 0.9,0.95. The maximal learning rate is 3.2e-4 with 1000 warmup steps and linearly decays
to 1.28e-5. The training corpus also follows StableLM-3B-4E1T (Tow et al., 2023). We employ
tiktoken-cl100k_base tokenizer. Detailed hyperparameters are provided in Appendix D.
Results Table 1 reports the zero-shot results on the LM Eval Harness benchmark (Gao et al., 2023).
We compare DIFFTransformer with well-trained Transformer-based language models, including
OpenLLaMA-v2-3B (Geng & Liu, 2023), StableLM-base-alpha-3B-v2 (Tow, 2023), and StableLM-
3B-4E1T (Tow et al., 2023). OpenLLaMA-v2-3B and StableLM-base-alpha-3B-v2 are also trained
with 1T tokens. The 1T results of StableLM-3B-4E1T are taken from its technical report (Tow et al.,
2023). Experimental results show that DIFFTransformer achieves favorable performance compared
to previous well-tuned Transformer language models. In addition, Appendix B shows that DIFF
Transformer outperforms Transformer across various tasks, where we use the same setting to train
the 3B-size language models for fair comparisons.

3.2 S CALABILITY COMPARED WITH TRANSFORMER
We compare the scaling properties of DIFFTransformer and Transformer on language modeling. We
scale up the model size, and the number of training tokens, respectively. We follow the augmented
Transformer architecture as in LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and use the same setting to ensure fair
comparison. Specifically, the “Transformer” models include improvements in RMSNorm (Zhang &
Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020; Ramachandran et al., 2017), and removal of bias.
Scaling Model Size As shown in Figure 3a, we train language models with 830M, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.8B,
and 13.1B parameters. The models are trained with a sequence length of 2048, and a batch size of
0.25M tokens. We train models for 40K steps. Detailed hyperparameters are described in Appendix E.
The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) empirically fits well in this configuration. Figure 3a shows
thatDIFFTransformer outperforms Transformer in various model sizes. The results indicate that
DIFFTransformer is scalable in terms of parameter count. According to the fitted curves, 6.8B-size
DIFFTransformer achieves a validation loss comparable to 11B-size Transformer, requiring only
62.2% of parameters. Similarly, 7.8B-size DIFFTransformer matches the performance of 13.1B-size
Transformer, requiring only 59.5% of parameters.
Scaling Training Tokens As shown in Figure 3b, we evaluate the 3B language models (as presented
in Appendix B) every 40B tokens (i.e., 10K steps) up to a total of 360B tokens (i.e., 90K steps).
The fitted curves indicate that DIFFTransformer trained with 160B tokens achieves comparable
performance as Transformer trained with 251B tokens, consuming only 63.7% of the training tokens.

hyperparameters are kept the same as in Section 3.1.
The learning rate is 8e-5. The RoPE (Su et al., 2021) θis
increased to 640,000. The training corpus is up-sampled
according to sequence length (Fu et al., 2024).
Results Figure 4 presents cumulative average nega-
tive log-likelihood (NLL) of the tokens at varying po-
sitions (Reid et al., 2024), where lower NLL indicates
better performance. The evaluation is conducted on
book data within 64K length. We observe a consistent
decrease in NLL as the context length increases. DIFF
Transformer achieves lower NLL values than Trans-
former. The results demonstrate that DIFFTransformer
can effectively leverage the increasing context.

3.4 K EYINFORMATION RETRIEVAL
The Needle-In-A-Haystack (Kamradt, 2023) test is widely used to evaluate the ability to extract
critical information embedded in a large context. We follow the multi-needle evaluation protocol of
LWM (Liu et al., 2024a) and Gemini 1.5 (Reid et al., 2024). The needles are inserted into varying
depths within contexts of different lengths. Each needle consists of a concise sentence that assigns a
unique magic number to a specific city. The goal is to retrieve the magic numbers corresponding to
the query cities. We position the answer needle at five different depths within the context: 0%, 25%,
50%, 75%, and 100%, while placing other distracting needles randomly. Each combination of depth
and length is evaluated using 50samples. The average accuracy is reported. Let Ndenote the total
number of number-city pairs and Rthe number of query cities.

Nrepresents the number of needles, and Rde-

in Table 2, we insert N= 1,2,4,6needles into
4K-length contexts and retrieve R= 1,2nee-
dles. We evaluate 3B-size models trained with
4K input length (Appendix B). We find that both
models obtain good accuracy for N= 1 and
N= 2. AsNandRincrease, DIFFTransformer
maintains a consistent accuracy, while the per-
formance of Transformer drops significantly. In
particular, at N= 6, R= 2, the accuracy gap be-
tween the two models reaches 30%. The results
indicate the superior ability of DIFFTransformer
to retrieve key information in distracting contexts.
Retrieve from 64K Context Length As shown in Figure 5, the evaluated context length ranges
from 8K to 64K for the N= 8, R= 1setting. We evaluate the 3B-size models with length extension
(Section 3.3). We report the accuracy across varying answer needle depths (y-axis) and context
lengths (x-axis). The bottom row is the average accuracy for all depths. DIFFTransformer maintains
stable performance across different context lengths. In contrast, Transformer’s average accuracy
gradually declines as the context length increases up to the maximal length, i.e., 64K. Besides, DIFF
Transformer outperforms Transformer particularly when key information is positioned within the first
half of the context (i.e., 0%, 25%, and 50% depth). In particular, when needles are placed at the 25%
depth in a 64K context, D IFFTransformer achieves 76% accuracy improvement over Transformer.
Attention Score Analysis Table 3 presents the attention scores allocated to the answer span and
the noise context for the key information retrieval task. The scores indicate the model’s ability to
preserve useful information against attention noise. We compare the normalized attention scores
when key information is inserted at different positions (i.e., depths) within the context. Compared
with Transformer, DIFFTransformer allocates higher attention scores to the answer span and has
lower attention noise.

3.5 I N-CONTEXT LEARNING
We evaluate in-context learning from two perspectives, including many-shot classification and
robustness of in-context learning. In-context learning is a fundamental capability of language models,
which indicates how well a model can utilize input context.
Many-Shot In-Context Learning As presented in Figure 6, we compare the accuracy of many-shot
classification between Transformer and our architecture. We evaluate the 3B-size language models
that support 64K input length (Section 3.3). We follow the evaluation protocol of (Bertsch et al.,
2024) and use constrained decoding (Ratner et al., 2023). We incrementally increase the number
of demonstration samples from 1-shot until the total length reaches 64K length. Specifically, the
TREC (Hovy et al., 2001) dataset has 6 classes, TREC-fine (Hovy et al., 2001) has 50 classes,
Banking-77 (Casanueva et al., 2020) has 77 classes, and Clinic-150 (Larson et al., 2019) has 150
classes. The results show that DIFFTransformer consistently outperforms Transformer across datasets
and varying numbers of demonstration samples. Moreover, the improvement in average accuracy is
substantial, ranging from 5.2% to 21.6%.

Two prompt formats are examined.
Robustness of In-Context Learning Figure 7 compares the robustness of in-context learning
between Transformer and DIFFTransformer. Given the same demonstration examples, we analyze
the performance variance with order permutations. Lower variance indicates greater robustness and
less risk of catastrophic performance degradation. The evaluation protocol is the same as above.
Figure 7 presents the analysis on the TREC dataset. More results are also provided in Appendix F.
We evaluate two prompt formats, i.e., examples are randomly arranged (Figure 7a), and alternately
arranged by class (Figure 7b). In both settings, DIFFTransformer has much smaller performance
variance compared to Transformer. The results indicate that our approach is more robust for in-context
learning. In contrast, Transformer tends to be distracted by order permutations (Lu et al., 2022),
resulting in a huge margin between the best and worst results.
3.6 C ONTEXTUAL HALLUCINATION EVALUATION
We evaluate contextual hallucination of the 3B-size language models (described in Appendix B)
on text summarization and question answering. Notice that we focus on the cases where the input
context contains correct facts, but the model still fails to produce accurate outputs.
We follow the evaluation protocol of (Chuang et al., 2024). We feed the model output along with
ground-truth responses to GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024). Then we ask GPT-4o to make binary judgements
on whether the model outputs are accurate and free of hallucinations. Previous studies (Chuang et al.,
2024; Ravi et al., 2024) have shown that the above hallucination evaluation protocol has relatively
high agreement between GPT-4o judgments and human annotations. The automatic metric is reliable
and mirrors the human evaluation. For each dataset, the accuracy is averaged over 100 samples.
Summarization Table 4a presents hallucination evaluation on summarization datasets
XSum (Narayan et al., 2018), CNN/DM (See et al., 2017), and MultiNews (Fabbri et al., 2019). The
task is to generate summaries for input documents.

Transformer mitigates outliers compared to Transformer.
Question Answering As shown in Table 4b, we compare the hallucination rate of DIFFTransformer
and Transformer on both single- and multi-document question answering. The Qasper (Dasigi et al.,
2021) dataset is single-document question answering. In contrast, HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and
2WikiMultihopQA (Ho et al., 2020) are multi-document question answering. The goal is to answer
questions about the given context. All evaluation examples are from LongBench (Bai et al., 2023).
Compared with Transformer, our method mitigates contextual hallucination on summarization and
question answering. The performance improvement possibly stems from DIFFTransformer’s better
focus on essential information needed for the task, instead of irrelevant context. This aligns with
previous observation (Huang et al., 2024) that one primary reason for contextual hallucination in
Transformer is the misallocation of attention scores.
3.7 A CTIVATION OUTLIERS ANALYSIS
In large language models, a subset of activations manifests with significantly larger values compared
to the majority, a phenomenon commonly called activation outliers (Bondarenko et al., 2024; Sun
et al., 2024). The outliers result in difficulties for model quanti","The Differential Transformer is a new type of machine learning model that builds on the popular Transformer architecture. Transformers are a powerful type of neural network that have been widely used for tasks like language processing and translation. The key innovation in the Differential Transformer is the ""differential attention"" mechanism. This allows the model to focus more on the parts of the input that are most relevant for the task at hand, rather than treating all parts of the input equally. For example, when processing a sentence, the Differential Transformer can learn to pay more attention to the words that are most important for understanding the meaning, and less attention to words that are less relevant. This helps the model make more accurate predictions. The paper shows that this differential attention approach leads to better performance on a variety of benchmark tasks, compared to standard Transformer models. The authors believe this is because the Differential Transformer is able to extract more useful information from the input data."

Abstract
The introduction of Transformers in 2017 reshaped the landscape of deep learning.
Originally proposed for sequence modelling, Transformers have since achieved
widespread success across various domains. However, the scalability limitations
of Transformers—particularly with respect to sequence length—have sparked re-
newed interest in novel recurrent models that are parallelizable during training,
offer comparable performance, and scale more effectively. In this work, we revisit
sequence modelling from a historical perspective, focusing on Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), which dominated the field for two decades before the rise of
Transformers. Specifically, we examine LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). We
demonstrate that by simplifying these models, we can derive minimal versions
(minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use fewer parameters than their traditional
counterparts, (2) are fully parallelizable during training, and (3) achieve surpris-
ingly competitive performance on a range of tasks, rivalling recent models includ-
ing Transformers.
1 Introduction
Since the 1990s, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Elman, 1990), such as Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) networks and later Gated Recurrent Units
(GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014), have been go-to methods for sequence modelling tasks like machine
translation and text generation. However, their inherently sequential nature, which limits paral-
lelization, made these models computationally inefficient and too slow to train on long sequences, a
common challenge in real-world applications.
In 2017, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized deep learning by introducing a paral-
lelizable training mechanism through self-attention, achieving immediate success in sequence mod-
elling. This breakthrough led to the development of popular large language models and quickly
extended to other domains, including computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), reinforcement
learning (Chen et al., 2021), and bioinformatics (Jumper et al., 2021). However, while self-attention
allows for efficient modelling of token-to-token interactions, it suffers from quadratic computa-
tional complexity, making Transformers prohibitively expensive for long sequences, especially in
resource-constrained settings. To address this, numerous approaches have focused on improving

Transformer efficiency, exploring ideas such as sparsity (Kitaev et al., 2019), low-rank approxima-
tions (Wang et al., 2020), and tiling (Dao et al., 2022).
Recently, the scalability limitations of Transformers have sparked renewed interest in alternative ap-
proaches: novel recurrent models that are parallelizable and scale more efficiently. Several promis-
ing methods have emerged in this space, including state-space models (Gu et al., 2021), linearized
attention (Peng et al., 2023), and more recently, linear recurrent neural networks (Orvieto et al.,
2023). Notably, these state-of-the-art recurrent models leverage input-dependent transitions and
demonstrate strong performance similar to Transformers. These methods have shown success not
only in scaling to large language models but also in extending to other domains, such as image (Zhu
et al., 2024a) and graph-based data (Wang et al., 2024a).
In this work, we revisit sequence modelling from a historical perspective, focusing on the RNNs
that dominated the field for two decades before the rise of Transformers. Specifically, we explore
LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014), which are early examples of input-dependent recurrent models.
We show that by removing the dependencies of their gates on previous states, we can train these
models in parallel. Further simplification leads to minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs)
that (1) use fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts, (2) are fully parallelizable during
training, and (3) achieve surprisingly competitive performance on a range of tasks despite their
simplicity, challenging the prevailing trend in the community toward increasing architectural and
algorithmic complexity. In the appendix, we provide implementations of minGRU and minLSTM in
plain PyTorch, with just a few lines of code, making these models lightweight and highly adaptable
for beginners, practitioners, and researchers.
2 Background
In this section, we review traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are sequence models
that maintain a hidden state across time steps, capturing temporal dependencies. As such, they are
particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as time series forecasting, natural
language processing, and other tasks where context from previous steps informs current predictions.
However, vanilla RNNs (Elman, 1990) face challenges related to vanishing and exploding gradients,
which limit their ability to learn long-term dependencies.
2.1 LSTM
To address these issues, Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) introduced Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks. LSTMs are a highly successful type of RNN specifically designed to mitigate
the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the model to effectively capture long-term dependencies.
LSTMs are computed as follows:
(Hidden State) ht=ot⊙tanh( ct)
(Output Gate) ot=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
(Cell State Recurrence) ct=ft⊙ct−1+it⊙˜ct
(Forget Gate) ft=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
(Input Gate) it=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
(Candidate Cell State) ˜ct= tanh(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
where ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication of vectors, tis the current timestep, and htis the
outputted hidden state. [xt,ht−1]represents the concatenation of the input vector xtat time step t
with the previous hidden state ht−1.dhdenotes the size of the hidden state, while ctis the cell state,
which carries information across time steps, and ˜ctis the candidate cell state that will be added to
the cell state.
The gates it,ft, and otcontrol the flow of information through the LSTM. The input gate itdeter-
mines how much new information from the candidate cell state ˜ctshould be added to the cell state
ct. The forget gate ftdetermines what portion of the previous cell state ct−1should be discarded.
The output gate otdetermines what information from the cell state should be output as the hidden
stateht. The functions σ(sigmoid) and tanh are used for scaling the values, ensuring that the out-
2
puts do not explode or vanish during training. An LSTM module maintains both a cell state and a
hidden state, and, in total, contains O(4dh(dx+dh))parameters, where dxis the input size.
2.2 GRU
Simplifying LSTM, Cho et al. (2014) introduced the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which uses only
two gates and a single state (hidden state), in contrast to the LSTM’s three gates and two states
(hidden state and cell state). This reduced complexity allows GRUs to achieve faster training and
inference times while still performing competitively on many tasks. GRUs are computed as follows:
(Hidden State Recurrence) ht= (1−zt)⊙ht−1+zt⊙˜ht
(Update Gate) zt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
(Reset Gate) rt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
(Candidate Hidden State) ˜ht= tanh(Linear dh([xt,rt⊙ht−1]))
where ˜htrepresents the candidate hidden state, a potential new value for the hidden state. GRU
combines the forget and input gates of LSTM into a single update gate, zt∈(0,1), which determines
how much of the past information should be carried forward (i.e., 1−zt) and how much new
information from the candidate hidden state should be added (i.e., zt). Additionally, GRU removes
LSTM’s output gate and introduces a reset gate rt, which controls how much of the past hidden state
ht−1is used when computing the candidate hidden state ˜ht.
By reducing the number of gates and states, GRU also decreases the total number of parameters and
computations, requiring only O(3dh(dx+dh))parameters. However, both GRUs and LSTMs are
still sequential-only models. As such, they require backpropagation through time (BPTT) during
training, resulting in linear training time and limiting their ability to scale to long contexts.
2.3 Parallel Scan
Due to this limitation, the introduction of Transformers in 2017 revolutionized the field by replacing
LSTMs and GRUs as the de facto method for sequence modelling. Transformers leverage par-
allelization during training, overcoming the sequential bottleneck of traditional recurrent models.
However, instead, Transformers have a quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length,
limiting their ability to scale to very long contexts, especially in resource-constrained settings.
In response, a resurgence of new recurrent sequence models has emerged, offering alternatives to
Transformers. These models achieve comparable performance while being trainable in parallel and
avoid the backpropagation through time (BPTT) issues that plagued traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs
and GRUs). Among these innovations, many architectures rely on the parallel prefix scan algo-
rithm (Blelloch, 1990) for efficient training.
The parallel scan algorithm is a parallel computation method for computing Nprefix computations
from Nsequential data points via an associative operator ⊕(e.g., +and×). The algorithm effi-
ciently computes the sequence of prefix sums {Lk
i=1ui}N
k=1from the input sequence {uk}N
k=1. One
important application of the parallel scan algorithm is in computing a popular class of recurrence
relations of the form vt=atvt−1+bt, where vt,at, andbtare real numbers and v0←b0(Martin &
Cundy, 2018). This method takes as input the sequences a1, . . . , a nandb0, b1, . . . , b n, and computes
the sequence v1, . . . , v nin parallel. This approach naturally extends to vector-valued recurrences,
such as vt=at⊙vt−1+bt, where ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication.
3 Methodology
Interestingly, we can see that the GRU’s hidden state and LSTM’s cell state recurrences resemble the
vector formulation. In this section, we demonstrate that GRUs and LSTMs are trainable via parallel
scan by removing their previous state dependencies from their various gates. Building on this, we
further simplify these RNNs by removing their constraints on output range (i.e., tanh ). Combining
the steps, we describe minimal versions of GRUs and LSTMs (minGRUs and minLSTMs) that are
trainable in parallel.
3
3.1 A Minimal GRU: minGRU
3.1.1 Step 1: Drop previous state dependencies from gates
Revisiting GRU’s hidden state recurrence which works as follows:
ht= (1−zt)⊙ht−1+zt⊙˜ht
We can observe that the recurrence resembles the aforementioned parallel scan’s formulation vt=
at⊙vt−1+btwhere at←(1−zt),bt←zt⊙˜ht, and vt←ht. However, ztand˜ht
are dependent on the previous hidden state ht−1, i.e., zt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))and˜ht=
tanh(Linear dh([xt, rt⊙ht−1])). As a result, it is not possible to apply the parallel scan as is since
the algorithm’s inputs a1, . . . , anandb1, . . . , bnare conditional on already knowing its outputs
h1, . . . , hn−1.
A simple remedy to this is to simplify GRU by removing their previous hidden state (i.e., ht−1)
dependencies. Specifically, the changes are as follows:
zt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
rt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
˜ht= tanh(Linear dh([xt,rt⊙ht−1]))⇒zt=σ(Linear dh(xt))
˜ht= tanh(Linear dh(xt))
By removing the dependence on ht−1from the candidate hidden state ˜ht, the reset gate rtthat
would control ht−1weight is also no longer needed and is removed. Without the dependencies on
previous hidden states, the inputs to the algorithm a1, . . . , anandb1, . . . , bnare all easily computed
in parallel and can thus be used to compute h1, . . . , hnefficiently via the parallel scan.
Although there have been theoretical concerns about the absence of previous state dependen-
cies (Merrill et al., 2024), there has also been substantial empirical evidence supporting the effec-
tiveness of models that omit these dependencies, such as xLSTM (Beck et al., 2024) and Mamba (Gu
& Dao, 2024). Instead of explicitly modelling dependencies on previous states to capture long-range
dependencies, these kinds of recurrent models can learn them by stacking multiple layers. Notably,
in the xLSTM paper, their fully parallelized version (xLSTM[1:0]), which eliminates hidden state
dependencies, performed similarly to — and in some cases, better than — versions that retain these
dependencies (e.g., xLSTM[7:1]).
3.1.2 Step 2: Drop range restriction of candidate states
In GRU’s hidden state recurrence, the proportion carried over from the previous hidden state ( 1−zt)
and the amount added for the new candidate hidden state ( zt) sum to 1. As a result, the scale of
GRU’s hidden state value is time-independent. Instead, the scale of its hidden state depends on that
of its candidate hidden states ˜ht. The hyperbolic tangent function ( tanh ) plays a crucial role in
LSTMs and GRUs, restricting the range of (candidate) hidden states, i.e., ˜ht,ht∈(−1,1)dh. The
tanh helps stabilize the training and mitigates vanishing gradients that result from applying sigmoid
(σ) activations to linear transformations of the hidden state (e.g., zt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))). In
the previous step, these hidden state dependencies were removed. As such, we simplify GRU further
by removing the range restriction ( tanh ) on the (candidate) hidden states as follows:
˜ht= tanh(Linear dh(xt))⇒ ˜ht= Linear dh(xt)
3.1.3 minGRU
Combining the two simplification steps results in a minimal version of GRU (minGRU):
4
GRU
ht= (1−zt)⊙ht−1+zt⊙˜ht
zt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
rt=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
˜ht= tanh(Linear dh([xt,rt⊙ht−1]))⇒minGRU
ht= (1−zt)⊙ht−1+zt⊙˜ht
zt=σ(Linear dh(xt))
˜ht= Linear dh(xt)
The resulting model is significantly more efficient than the original GRU, requiring only O(2dhdx)
parameters, compared to GRU’s O(3dh(dx+dh))parameters, where dxanddhdenote the sizes of
the input xtand the hidden state ht, respectively. In RNNs, state expansion is often used (i.e., dh=
αdx, where α≥1), which helps the models better capture features from the input data. minGRU
uses approximately 33%,22%,17%, and 13% of the parameters of a GRU when α= 1,2,3,4,
respectively.
Additionally, the minimal version of GRU can now be trained in parallel using the parallel scan
algorithm, bypassing the need for backpropagation through time (BPTT). Pseudocode and a simple
PyTorch implementation are included in the Appendix.
3.2 A Minimal LSTM: minLSTM
3.2.1 Step 1: Drop previous state dependencies from gates
Revisiting LSTM’s cell state recurrence which works as follows:
ct=ft⊙ct−1+it⊙˜ct
Similar to GRU’s hidden state, we can see that LSTM’s cell state recurrence resembles the afore-
mentioned parallel scan’s formulation vt=at⊙vt−1+btwhere at←ft,bt←it⊙˜ct, and
vt←ct. However, ft,itand˜ctare dependent on the previous hidden state ht. As such, LSTM’s
cell state recurrence is unable to apply the parallel scan algorithm as is. We can address this in a
similar fashion to GRU by removing their hidden state dependencies as follows:
ft=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
it=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
˜ct= tanh(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))⇒ft=σ(Linear dh(xt))
it=σ(Linear dh(xt))
˜ct= tanh(Linear dh(xt))
3.2.2 Step 2: Drop range restriction of candidate states
Similar to GRUs, LSTMs leverage the hyperbolic tangent function ( tanh ) to restrict the range of
its states between (−1,1). LSTMs apply the range restriction twice: once when computing the
candidate cell state and once when computing its hidden state. In this step, we drop both as follows:
˜ct= tanh(Linear dh(xt))
ht=ot⊙tanh( ct)⇒˜ct= Linear dh(xt)
ht=ot⊙ct
3.2.3 Step 3: Simplifying scaling of output
Continuing the trend of simplification, we drop the output gate otwhich scales the hidden state.
Without the output gate, the normalized hidden state is equal to the cell state, i.e., ht=ot⊙ct⇒
ht=ct, making having both a hidden and cell state unnecessary. As such, we drop the cell state as
well, resulting in the following modification:
5
ht=ot⊙ct
ot=σ(Linear dh(xt))
ct=ft⊙ct−1+it⊙˜ct
˜ct= Linear dh(xt)⇒ht=ft⊙ht−1+it⊙˜ht
˜ht= Linear dh(xt)
In many sequence modelling settings (e.g., text generation), the optimization objective/target is time-
independent in scale. Recall LSTM’s cell state recurrence ct=ft⊙ct−1+it⊙˜ctwhere it,ft∈
(0,1)dh, and GRU’s hidden state recurrence1,hGRU
t = (1−zt)⊙hGRU
t−1+zt⊙˜hGRU
t where
zt∈(0,1)dh. GRUs retain (1−zt)∈(0,1)of the previous hidden state and add ztof the
new candidate state. Since these proportions sum to 1, the model ensures its outputs (i.e., hidden
states) are time-independent in scale. In contrast, LSTM’s forget and input gates are computed
independently (e.g., ft,it→1orft,it→0), making its states time-dependent in scale2. For
tasks where time-independence is important, we can ensure LSTM’s output is time-independent in
scale by simply normalizing its input and forget gates, i.e., f′
t,i′
t←ft
ft+it,it
ft+it, ensuring that
f′
t+i′
t=1and the scale of LSTM’s state is time-independent.
3.2.4 minLSTM
Combining the three steps results in a minimal version of LSTM (minLSTM):
LSTM
ht=ot⊙tanh( ct)
ot=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
ct=ft⊙ct−1+it⊙˜ct
ft=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
it=σ(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))
˜ct= tanh(Linear dh([xt,ht−1]))⇒minLSTM
ht=ft⊙ht−1+it⊙˜ht
ft=σ(Linear dh(xt))
it=σ(Linear dh(xt))
˜ht= Linear dh(xt)
where time-independent outputs can be achieved using a hidden state recurrence ht=f′
t⊙ht−1+
i′
t⊙˜htwith normalized forget f′
tand input itgates computed as f′
t,i′
t←ft
ft+it,it
ft+it.
The resulting model is significantly more efficient than the original LSTM, requiring only O(3dhdx)
parameters compared to LSTM’s O(4dh(dx+dh)). Considering state expansion (i.e., dh=αdx,
where α≥1), minLSTM uses approximately 38%,25%,19%,or15% of the parameters of a LSTM
when α= 1,2,3,or4respectively.
Additionally, the minimal version of LSTM can now be trained in parallel using the parallel scan
algorithm, bypassing the need for backpropagation through time (BPTT). Pseudocode and a simple
PyTorch implementation are included in the Appendix.
4 Were RNNs All We Needed?
In this section, we compare the minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) with their traditional
counterparts (LSTMs and GRUs) and modern sequence models. Pseudocode, PyTorch implementa-
tion, and detailed information regarding the experiment setup are available in the Appendix.

Figure 1: Training runtime (left), speedup (middle), and memory footprint (right) on a T4 GPU for a
batch size of 64. In the training runtime plot (left), minGRU, minLSTM, and Mamba lines overlap.
These methods are approximately the same in training runtime.
4.1 Minimal LSTMs and GRUs are efficient
At test time, recurrent sequence models are typically rolled out sequentially, which makes inference
relatively efficient. However, the main bottleneck for traditional RNNs lies in their training, which
requires linear time due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). This computational inefficiency
contributed to the eventual deprecation of many earlier RNN-based models.
In this section, we compare the resource requirements for training traditional RNNs (LSTM and
GRU), their simplified counterparts (minLSTM and minGRU)3, and Mamba (using the official im-
plementation), a recent popular recurrent sequence model.
For these experiments, a fixed batch size of 64 was used while varying the sequence length. We
measure both the total runtime and memory complexity involved in performing a forward pass,
computing the loss, and performing backpropagation to compute gradients. To ensure a fair and
direct comparison, all models were tested with the same number of layers.
Runtime. We would like to highlight that inference speed can vary depending on hardware and
implementation. PyTorch’s built-in RNNs are highly optimized low-level GPU implementations.
For a more fair comparison, in these experiments, minGRU, minLSTM, GRU, and LSTM were all
written in plain Pytorch. In terms of runtime (see Figure 1 (left)), the simplified versions of LSTM
and GRU (minLSTM and minGRU) Mamba achieve similar runtimes. Averaging over 100runs, the
runtime for sequence lengths of 512for minLSTM, minGRU, and Mamba were 2.97,2.72, and 2.71
milliseconds respectively. For a sequence with length 4096 , the runtime were 3.41,3.25, and 3.15
respectively. In contrast, the traditional RNN counterparts (LSTMs and GRUs) required a runtime
that scaled linearly with respect to sequence length. For a sequence length of 512, minGRUs and
minLSTMs were 175×and235×faster per training step (see Figure 1 (middle)) than GRUs and
LSTMs on a T4 GPU. The improvement is even more significant as sequences grow in length with
minGRUs and minLSTMs being 1324×and1361×faster for a sequence length of 4096 . As such,
in a setting where minGRU would take a day to finish training for a fixed number of epochs, its
traditional counterpart GRU could take over 3years.
Memory. By leveraging a parallel scan algorithm to compute the outputs in parallel efficiently,
minGRU, minLSTM, and Mamba create a larger computational graph, thus needing more memory
compared to traditional RNNs (see Figure 1 (right)). The minimal variants (minGRU and minL-
STM) use ∼88% more memory compared to their traditional counterparts (GRU and LSTM).
Mamba uses 56% more memory compared to minGRU. In practice, however, runtime is often the
bottleneck when training RNNs.
Effect of removing ht−1.The original LSTM and GRU compute their various gates using their
inputs xtand previous hidden states ht−1. These models leverage their time-dependent gates to
learn complex functions. However, minLSTM and minGRU’s training efficiencies are achieved by
dropping their gates’ dependencies on the previous hidden states ht−1. As a result, minLSTM and
minGRU’s gates are dependent only on their inputs xt, resulting in a simpler recurrent module. As
such, the gates of a model consisting of a single layer of minLSTM or minGRU are time-independent
due to being conditioned on time-independent inputs x(1)
1:n.
1A superscript is added to differentiate GRU’s hidden state from LSTM’s.
2For example, ct→c0+Pt
i=1˜ctwhen f1:t,i1:t→1, growing in scale as the sequence length increases.

Table 1: Comparison of the number of
layers on the Selective Copying Task (Gu
& Dao, 2024).However, in deep learning, models are constructed by
stacking modules. Although the inputs to the first layer
x(1)
1:nistime-independent , its outputs h(1)
1:naretime-
dependent and are used as the inputs to the second layer,
i.e.,x(2)
1:n←h(1)
1:n. As such, beginning from the second
layer onwards, minLSTM and minGRU’s gates will also
be time-dependent, resulting in the modelling of more
complex functions. In Table 1, we compare the perfor-
mance of the models with varying numbers of layers on
the Selective Copying Task from the Mamba paper (Gu
& Dao, 2024). We can immediately see the impact of
the time dependencies: increasing the number of layers
to2or more drastically increases performance.
Training Stability. Another effect of the number of layers is increased stability with decreased
variance in the accuracy as the number of layers increases (see Table 1). Furthermore, although
minLSTM and minGRU both solve the Selective Copying task, we can see that minGRU is an
empirically more stable method than minLSTM, solving the task with more consistency and lower
variance. minLSTM discards old information and adds new information, controlling the ratio with
two sets of parameters (forget and input gate). During training, the two sets of parameters are tuned
in different directions, making the ratio harder to control and optimize. In contrast, minGRU’s
discarding and adding of information is controlled by a single set of parameters (update gate).

STM, minGRU, and Mamba’s S6 (Gu &
Dao, 2024) are capable of solving this task.
Other methods such as S4, H3, and Hyena
at best only partially solve the task.In this section, we focus on the empirical perfor-
mance of these minimal versions of decades-old mod-
els LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014), comparing them
to several modern sequence models. It is important
to note that the primary goal of our work is not to
attain the best performance on specific tasks but to
demonstrate that simplifying traditional architectures
can yield competitive results, comparable to those of
recent sequence models.
Selective Copy. We begin by considering the Selec-
tive Copying task, originally introduced in the influ-
ential Mamba paper (Gu & Dao, 2024). This task
served as a key benchmark that demonstrated the im-
provements made by Mamba’s state-space model, S6,
over previous state-of-the-art models such as S4 (Gu
et al., 2021) and Hyena (Poli et al., 2023). The task
requires models to perform content-aware reasoning,
where they must selectively memorize relevant tokens
while filtering out irrelevant ones.
In Table 2, we compare the simplified versions of
LSTMs and GRUs (minLSTM and minGRU) with several well-known recurrent sequence mod-
els that can be trained in parallel, including S4 (Gu et al., 2021), H3 (Fu et al., 2023), Hyena (Poli
et al., 2023), and Mamba (S6) (Gu & Dao, 2024). The results for these baselines are directly quoted
from the Mamba paper. Among these, only Mamba’s S6 model succeeds in solving the task.
Both minGRU and minLSTM are able to solve the Selective Copying task as well, achieving perfor-
mance comparable to S6 and surpassing the other modern baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
of these traditional models LSTMs and GRUs, which utilize content-aware gating mechanisms.
Reinforcement Learning. Next, we consider the MuJoCo locomotion tasks from the D4RL bench-
mark (Fu et al., 2020). Specifically, we consider the three environments: HalfCheetah, Hopper, and
Walker. For each environment, the models are trained on three datasets of varying data quality:
Medium (M), Medium-Replay (M-R), and Medium-Expert (M-E).

The minimal versions of LSTM and GRU, minLSTM and minGRU outperform Decision S4 (David

are not input-aware, affecting their performance. In terms of average score across the 3×3 = 9

the difference is marginal.

faster, particularly in the early stages, achieving its best performance at 400steps while minGRU
and minLSTM continued training until 575 and625 steps respectively. In contrast, Transform-
ers trained significantly slower, requiring 2000 steps (∼2.5×) more training steps than minGRU
to achieve comparable performance, making it significantly slower and more resource-intensive to
train (quadratic complexity compared to minGRU, minLSTM, and Mamba’s linear complexity).

Abstract
While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their pho-
torealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering
similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily
excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data – characterized by oc-
clusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination – remains challenging. NeRFs
can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but
3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To
address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions
and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and
integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time
rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in
handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.
1 Introduction
Reconstruction of photorealistic 3D representations from a set of images has significant applications
across various domains, including the generation of immersive VR experiences, 3D content creation

for online platforms, games, and movies, and 3D environment simulation for robotics. The primary
objective is to achieve a multi-view consistent 3D scene representation from a set of input images
with known camera poses, enabling photorealistic rendering from novel viewpoints.
Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [ 1,25,37,30,38,26,9,17,29] have addressed this
challenge by learning a radiance field, which combines a density field and a viewing-direction-
dependent color field. These fields are rendered using volumetric rendering [ 12]. Despite producing
highly realistic renderings, NeRFs require evaluating numerous samples from the field per pixel to
accurately approximate the volumetric integral. Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [ 14,50,49,51,15,54]
has emerged as a faster alternative. 3DGS explicitly represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians,
which enables real-time rendering via rasterization at a rendering quality comparable to NeRFs.
Learning scene representations from training views alone introduces an ambiguity between geometry
and view-dependent effects. Both NeRFs and 3DGS are designed to learn consistent geometry while
simulating non-Lambertian effects, resolving ambiguity through implicit biases in the representation.
This works well in controlled settings with consistent illumination and minimal occlusion but typically
fails under varying conditions and larger levels of occlusion. However, in practical applications,
images are captured without control over the environment. Examples include crowd-sourced 3D re-
constructions [ 34,1], where images are collected at different times, seasons, and exposure levels, and
reconstructions that keep 3D models up-to-date via regular image recapturing. Besides environmental
condition changes, e.g., day-night changes, such images normally contain occluders, e.g., pedestrians
and cars, with which we need to deal with during the reconstruction process.
NeRF-based approaches handle appearance changes by conditioning the MLP that presents the
radiance field on an appearance embedding capturing specific image appearances [ 24,38,24].
This enables them to learn a class of multi-view consistent 3D representations, conditioned on the
embedding. However, this approach does not extend well to explicit representations such as 3DGS
[14], which store the colors of geometric primitives explicitly. Adding an MLP conditioned on an
appearance embedding would slow down rendering, as each frame would require evaluating the MLP
for all Gaussians. For occlusion handling, NeRFs [ 24,31] use uncertainty modeling to discount
losses from challenging pixels. However, in cases with both appearance changes and occlusions,
these losses are not robust, often incorrectly focusing on regions with difficult-to-capture appearances
instead of focusing on the occluders. While NeRFs can recover from early mistakes due to parameter
sharing, 3DGS, with its faster training and engineered primitive growth and pruning process, cannot,
as an incorrect training signal can lead to irreversibly removing parts of the geometry.
To address the issues, we propose to enhance Gaussians with trainable appearance embeddings and
using a small MLP to integrate image and appearance embeddings to predict an affine transformation
of the base color. This MLP is required only during training or when capturing the appearance of a
new image. After this phase, the appearance can be ""baked"" back into the standard 3DGS formulation,
ensuring fast rendering while maintaining the editability and flexibility of the 3DGS representation
[14]. For robust occlusion handling, we introduce an uncertainty predictor with a loss based on DINO
features [27], effectively eliminating occluders during training despite appearance changes.
Our contributions can be summarized as: (1) Appearance Modeling: Extending 3DGS [ 14] with a
per-Gaussian trainable embedding vector coupled with a tone-mapping MLP, enabling the rendered
image to be conditioned on a specific input image’s embedding. This extension preserves rendering
speed and maintains compatibility with 3DGS [ 14]. (2) Uncertainty Optimization: Introducing an
uncertainty optimization scheme robust to appearance changes, which does not disrupt the gradient
statistics used in adaptive density control. This scheme leverages the cosine similarity of DINO
v2 [27] features between training and predicted images to create an uncertainty mask, effectively
removing the influence of occluders during training. The source code, model checkpoints, and video
comparisons are available at: https://wild-gaussians.github.io/

Novel View Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes. Recent methods in novel view synthesis [25, 1, 14, 50]
predominantly focus on reconstructing static environments. However, dynamic components usually
occur in real-world scenarios, posing challenges for these methods. One line of work tries to
model both static and dynamic components from a video sequence [ 19,28,43,44,10,21,7,46].
Nonetheless, these methods often perform suboptimally when applied to photo collections [ 32].
In contrast, our research aligns with efforts to synthesize static components from dynamic scenes.

An uncertainty estimate is obtained by a learned transformation of the GT image’s DINO features. To train the
uncertainty, we use the DINO cosine similarity (dashed lines).
Methods such as RobustNeRF[ 32] utilize Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for outlier verification
in small, controlled settings, while NeRF On-the-go [31] employs DINO v2 features [ 27] to predict
uncertainties, allowing it to handle complex scenes with varying occlusion levels, albeit with long
training times. Unlike these approaches, our method optimizes significantly faster. Moreover, we
effectively handle dynamic scenarios even with changes in illumination.
Novel View Synthesis for Unstructured Photo Collections. In real-world scenes, e.g. the unstruc-
tured internet photo collections [ 35], difficulties arise not only from dynamic occlusions like moving
pedestrians and vehicles but also from varying illumination. Previously, these issues were tackled
using multi-plane image (MPI) methods [ 20]. More recently, NeRF-W [ 24], a pioneering work in
this area, addresses these challenges with per-image transient and appearance embeddings, along
with leveraging aleatoric uncertainty for transient object removal. However, the method suffers from
slow training and rendering speeds. Other NeRF-based methods followed NeRF-W extending it
in various ways [ 37,47]. Recent concurrent works, including our own, explore the replacement of
NeRF representations with 3DGS for this task. Some methods [ 33,6] address the simpler problem
of training 3DGS under heavy occlusions, or only tackling appearance changes [ 23,48,8] with no
occlusions. However, the main challenge is integrating appearance conditioning with the locally inde-
pendent 3D Gaussians under occlusions. VastGaussian [ 22] applies a convolutional network to 3DGS
outputs which does not transfer to large appearance changes, as shown in the Appendix. SWAG [ 5]
and Scaffold-GS [ 23] address this by storing appearance data in an external hash-grid-based implicit
field [ 26], while GS-W [ 52] and WE-GS [ 41] utilize CNN features for appearance conditioning on a
reference image. In contrast, our method employs a simpler and more scalable strategy by embedding
appearance vectors directly within each Gaussian. This design not only simplifies the architecture
but also enables us to ’bake’ the trained representation back into 3DGS after appearances are fixed,
enhancing both efficiency and adaptability. Finally, a concurrent work, Splatfacto-W [ 45], uses a
similar appearance MLP to combine Gaussian and image embeddings to output spherical harmonics.
3 Method
Our approach, termed WildGaussians, is shown in Fig. 2. To allow 3DGS-based approaches to handle
the uncontrolled capture of scenes, we propose two key components: (1) appearance modeling
enables our approach to handle the fact that the observed pixel colors not only depend on the
viewpoint but also on conditions such as the capture time and the weather. Following NeRF-based
approaches for reconstructing scenes from images captured under different conditions [ 24,30], we
train an appearance embedding per training image to model such conditions. In addition, we train
an appearance embedding per Gaussian to model local effects, e.g., active illumination of parts of
the scene from lamps. Both embeddings are used to transform the color stored for a Gaussian to
match the color expected for a given scene appearance. To this end, we predict an affine mapping
3
[30] in color space via an MLP. (2) uncertainty modeling allows our approach to handle occluders
during the training stage by determining which regions of a training image should be ignored. To this
end, we extract DINO v2 features [ 27] from training images, and pass them as input to a trainable
affine transformation which predicts a per-pixel uncertainty, encoding which parts of an image likely
correspond to static regions and which parts show occluders. The uncertainty predictor is optimized
using the cosine similarity between the DINO features extracted from training images and renderings.
3.1 Preliminaries: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
We base our method on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [ 14,50] scene representation, where the
scene is represented as a set of 3D Gaussians {Gi}. Each Gaussian Giis represented by its mean
µi, a positive semi-definite covariance matrix Σi[54], an opacity αi, and a view-dependent color
parametrized using spherical harmonics (SH). During rendering, the 3D Gaussians are first projected
into the 2D image [ 54], resulting in 2D Gaussians. Let Wbe the viewing transformation, then the 2D
covariance matrix Σ′
iin image space is given as [54]:

i=","The paper presents a new way to create 3D models from images and videos captured in the real world. Traditional 3D modeling often requires carefully controlled environments or expensive equipment. WildGaussians aims to make 3D modeling more accessible by working with regular photos and videos taken in uncontrolled settings, like a person's home or a busy city street. The key insight is to represent the 3D world using simple geometric shapes called Gaussians. These Gaussians can be quickly rendered on a computer's graphics card, allowing for real-time 3D reconstruction and rendering. This means you can create 3D models and explore them interactively, even on ordinary devices like smartphones or laptops. The WildGaussians approach is inspired by recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting and generative models that can create 3D scenes from 2D images. By combining these ideas, the researchers have developed a system that can capture the complex shapes and appearances found in real-world environments, while still being efficient enough for interactive use."

Abstract
Recent large language models (LLMs) advance-
ments sparked a growing research interest in
tool assisted LLMs solving real-world chal-
lenges, which calls for comprehensive evalu-
ation of tool-use capabilities. While previous
works focused on either evaluating over state-
less web services (RESTful API), based on a
single turn user prompt, or an off-policy dialog
trajectory, TOOLSANDBOX1includes stateful
tool execution, implicit state dependencies be-
tween tools, a built-in user simulator support-
ing on-policy conversational evaluation and a
dynamic evaluation strategy for intermediate
and final milestones over an arbitrary trajec-
tory. We show that open source and proprietary
models have a significant performance gap, and
complex tasks like State Dependency, Canoni-
calization and Insufficient Information defined
inTOOLSANDBOX are challenging even the
most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-
new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities.

Recent advancements in Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs) brought forth new opportunities treat-
ing LLMs as autonomous agents, capable of observ-
ing real-world environments and deciding upcom-
ing actions. Among which, tool-use agents (Schick
et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023a; Patil et al., 2023; Qin
et al., 2024) follow human instructions and utilize
real-world APIs to complete complex tasks. Con-
trary to prior approaches like dialog state tracking
1TOOLSANDBOX evaluation framework is released at
https://github.com/apple/ToolSandbox(Henderson et al., 2014; Budzianowski et al., 2018;
Rastogi et al., 2020), which require the model to
explicitly generate dialog states and actions under
a predefined ontology, and derive a tool call from
those structured outputs, tool-use studies allow the
model to directly generate tool calls based on its
observations, while keeping dialog and world state
tracking implicit.
Despite the paradigm shift towards a more sim-
plified problem formulation, the stateful ,conver-
sational andinteractive nature of task oriented di-
alog remains, and poses a significant challenge for
systematic and accurate evaluation of tool-using
LLMs. Existing benchmarks like the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) (Yan et al.,
2024), ToolEval (Qin et al., 2024) and API-Bank
(Li et al., 2023) attempted to tackle some of these
challenges, but there is yet to be an all encompass-
ing solution.
Stateful Task oriented dialog often involves tools
that are strongly coupled with a World State , e.g. a
database. This can be a tool that can alter the world
state, like turning on internet connection. More
interestingly, there can be a tool that implicitly de-
pends on a world state, for example, one cannot
search for a nearby restaurant when internet con-
nection is off. Sometimes, actions that deal with
both of these scenarios need to be taken to complete
a task, even if the user is agnostic to the underly-
ing world state and only gives general instructions.
The agent needs to use its own knowledge about
the world and environment feedback to come up
with a plan to modify the world state and complete
the task. An example can be found in Figure 1.
BFCL (Yan et al., 2024) and ToolEval (Qin et al.,
2024) both rely on stateless tools interacting with
web services (through RESTful APIs). As such,
these evaluation benchmarks are designed to assess
how agents make trials with a static environment.
API-Bank (Li et al., 2023) does include a set of

Agent and the Execution Environment . The World State represents mutable database snapshots at a given turn. The
Milestones represent predefined key events that need to happen in this trajectory. In this example, the User intended

prompt for necessary arguments from the User . After collecting all arguments with the help of the search_contacts
tool, the Agent attempted to send the message, figured out it needs to enable cellular service upon failure, and retried.
To evaluate this trajectory, we find the best match for all Milestones against Message Bus andWorld State in each
turn while maintaining topological order.
tools to modify world states, but does not study the
impact of state dependencies.
Conversational Conversational evaluation is cru-
cial yet challenging when assessing a dialog policy,
due to the interdependency between a user and said
policy, as well as the ambiguous nature of natural
language. To facilitate automated conversational
evaluation, a common practice is to implement a
simulated user (Zhang et al., 2024; Sekulic et al.,
2024). However, BFCL and ToolEval only evalu-
ate self-contained, unambiguous single-turn user
queries, which is hardly realistic. API-Bank eval-
uates on unrolled predefined off-policy dialog tra-
jectories, and thus cannot assess the agent’s perfor-
mance based on its own policy.
Interactive Real world scenarios are full of sur-
prises. The agent could issue an erroneous tool
call. Tool execution could raise an unexpected
exception. And the user could issue a follow-up
correcting a previous statement. An interactiveevaluation framework assessing the immediate re-
turn of key interactions with user or environment
would be necessary to capture the intricate interac-
tion between different roles. Such an interactive
evaluation should provide full spectrum and fine-
grained evaluation of any multi-turn session. In this
regard, BFCL and API-Bank both rely on a prede-
fined trajectory, and by extension rely on static turn
wise evaluation metrics. Even though ToolEval
allows multiple rounds of interaction between the
Agent and tools, it relies solely on an LLM eval-
uator to judge the final pass rate and win rate of
trajectories, which raises questions to its reliability
and interpretability.
Driven by these motivations, we propose TOOL-
SANDBOX , a stateful, conversational and interac-
tive tool-use benchmark. To the best of our knowl-
edge, TOOLSANDBOX is the first LLM tool-use
benchmark which
•Includes implicit state dependencies between
stateful tools, allowing the agent to track and
2
alter the world state based on its world/com-
monsense knowledge, which is implicit from
the user query;
•Includes an LLM simulated user, allowing for
realistic, on-policy conversational evaluation
to measure the agent’s ability on implicit dia-
log state tracking;
•Allows for fully interactive, dynamic trajec-
tory collection with a representative set of
highly composable tools, and a human au-
thored, milestone / minefield based system for
intermediate and final execution evaluation.
A comparison between TOOLSANDBOX and
other benchmarks can be found in Table 1.
2 T OOL SANDBOX Design
Figure 2: Interaction between the User, Agent and
the Execution Environment. Boxes represent multiple
rounds of interaction between involved roles.
At its core, TOOLSANDBOX is a Python native
LLM testing environment, with Execution Context
as world state abstraction and Python functions
asTools , where User ,Agent andExecution Envi-
ronment communicate with each other through a
Message Bus to complete a task, which is evaluated
against predefined Milestones andMinefields . As
shown in Figure 2, a typical test case starts with the
User speaking to the Agent . From then on, the role
being addressed gets to speak next, until the end
state is reached. Upon receiving a User request, an
Agent can decide to respond to the User asking for
more information, or inform the Execution Envi-
ronment to execute a Tool, providing intended tool
name and arguments. The Execution Environment
executes the Tool in an code.InteractiveConsole ,
(Foundation, 2024), which depending on the Tool
modifies the world state stored in the Execution
Context , and responds to the Agent . Once the
User decides the task has been completed, it in-
forms the Execution Environment to execute the
end_conversation tool, which puts the system in
the end state, ready to be evaluated based on the di-
alog’s similarity to Milestones andMinefields . Theremainder of this section introduces the functional-
ity of each component in more details.
2.1 Tools
Tools in TOOLSANDBOX are a set of highly com-
posable, explicitly or implicitly dependent Python
functions, creating complex reasoning challenges.
Besides python native tools, a handful of carefully
selected RapidAPI tools were also included with
a thin layer of python wrapper. Tools manipulate
world state through the Execution Context when
necessary, and raise informative exceptions when
execution conditions were not met. See Appendix
A.1 and A.2 for more information. As an exam-
ple, in Figure 1, when send_message tool is called
while cellular service is off, a ConnectionError
is raised. This allows the Agent to reason over
possible exceptions, and deduce the tool needed to
resolve the exception.
To support ablation studies on the effect of tool
schema representation on agent accuracy, we have
implemented multiple tool augmentations, e.g.:
•The agent is given distraction tools not needed
to complete the task.
•Tool or argument names becomes less infor-
mative, e.g. using a tool name of settings_0
instead of set_cellular_service_status
to test if the agent relies on them to infer a
tool’s purpose.
•Information like argument descriptions or
type hints are removed.
For more details on the augmentations please
refer to Appendix A.2.1.
2.2 Roles and Message Bus
InTOOLSANDBOX there are three roles: User ,
Agent (Assistant) andExecution Environment . The
Execution Environment, as a dedicated role, is re-
sponsible for executing tool-use requests from the
Agent and returning the results. Interaction be-
tween the roles is enabled through a message pass-
ing system. Each message contains a sender role,
recipient role, content as well as to which roles the
message is visible to. A simple orchestrator deter-
mines message passing order by allowing the most
recent recipient to be the next sender. Instead of
representing the conversation as a single message
thread, we use a collection of messages, i.e. Mes-
sage Bus , stored within the Execution Context. The
Message Bus contains a linear history of message
transactions between all roles. As is shown in Ap-
pendix A.3, each role writes to the same Message
3
Bus. However, when reading from the Message
Bus, each role can only access a sub-view of the
Message Bus based on which roles are allowed to
""see"" the individual messages. We will introduce
each role in the following paragraphs.
User Role The User role represents a human in-
teracting with an Agent, hoping to complete a task
through possibly multiple rounds of conversation.
When the User role decides the task has been com-
pleted, or could not be completed, it can terminate
the conversation using the end_conversation
tool, which is the single tool available to the User.
The User role is implemented with an LLM (GPT-
4o) and carefully calibrated prompting design to
make the user simulator more realistic. As re-
lated studies in user simulation (Zhang et al., 2024;
Sekulic et al., 2024) suggest, one should include the
user’s overall goal in the simulator’s system prompt.
However, we found this is often insufficient for the
complex interactions in TOOLSANDBOX , and can
lead to two categories of failures. In some cases, it
is infeasible for an LLM simulated user to judge
task completion, or provide follow-up information
with only access to the user goal, and not the ex-
pected result, which could lead to hallucination.
Also, with only a single system prompt, the simu-
lated user could be derailed by the tool-use agent,
failing to follow instructions. Examples of these
failures can be found in Appendix A.4.
In light of this, we propose two additional com-
ponents in user simulator prompts: Knowledge
Boundary , which inform the user simulator what
it should and should not know, providing partial
access to expected result, combating hallucination.
And Demonstration , which provides few shot ex-
ample dialogs to the user simulator. Prompt ex-
amples can be found in Appendix A.4. Note that
demonstration is only visible to the user simula-
tor and not the agent. We performed an ablation
study for these components in Table 2. With both
approaches combined, the LLM simulated user
achieves the lowest error rate in all categories. User
simulator error rate is also found to be consistent
across well performing agents, shown in Table 5.
Agent Role Initially, the Agent role will receive
a message from the User in natural language. The
Agent could decide to prompt the User again for
additional information, or decide to issue a tool call
towards the Execution Environment. When issuing
a tool call, the Agent selects the name of the tool
from a list of available tools and provides necessaryHallucination ↓IF↓

arguments, commonly expressed as JSON objects.
These JSON objects are converted to executable
Python code, see Appendix A.5, and sent to the
Execution Environment for execution.
Execution Environment Role The execution en-
vironment role is responsible for executing tool
calls requested by the Agent and User roles in the
form of Python snippets, mimicking the behavior
of interactive consoles like IPython and Jupyter.
Exceptions raised while executing the code are cap-
tured through stderr, enabling the Agent to refine
its tool calls through trial and error.
Some LLMs support parallel tool calling, in-
tended to increase efficiency when multiple, inde-
pendent tools need to be called. However, if an
LLM uses parallel tool calls for dependent tools,
it should be penalized accordingly. For example,
in Figure 1 where the agent has to enable cellular
service before sending a text message, parallel tool
calls should not be used. Execution Environment
handles race conditions in parallel tool calls by
following Murphy’s Law, ensuring race condition
always happens if detected.
2.3 Evaluation
With an interactive, stateful and conversational en-
vironment, evaluation trajectories are highly dy-
namic. Multiple trajectories can lead to the same
outcome. A given task may be completed using
different tools, the same tools in a different order,
or through trial and error, and the evaluation strat-
egy has to be flexible enough to accommodate for
that. To combat this, we developed an evaluation
strategy based on Milestones andMinefields , which
defines key events that must or must not happen in
a trajectory, allowing us to evaluate any trajectory
with rich intermediate and final execution signals,
providing deeper understanding of the model per-
formance. An example can be found in Figure 10.
In specific, Milestones are the critical steps
needed to achieve a goal. An example is shown in
4
Figure 1, where cellular service is turned off and
the user asks the agent to send a text message. The
milestones, in this example, would be defined as:
1.The cellular status in the settings database
must be changed to True .
2.The Agent must issue a tool call using the
search_contacts tool and the correct argu-
ments, before or after milestone 1.
3.The Agent must issue a tool call using the
send_message tool and the correct arguments,
after milestone 1 and 2.
4.The messaging database must contain a mes-
sage with a phone number matching the ex-
pected one exactly and the content loosely
matching the expected text, after milestone 3.
Each milestone also defines a similarity measure
which calculates a 0 to 1 similarity between each
turn and the milestone. Types of available similar-
ity measures are introduced in Appendix A.6. Mile-
stones form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based
on temporal dependency. To evaluate a trajectory
against a milestone DAG, we find the the highest
averaged similarity score M+among all possible
mappings between turns and milestones, given that
the resulting chronic milestone sequence is a topo-
logical sort of the DAG. Task efficiency is not con-
sidered by Milestones, and is instead tracked by
a complementary turn count metric shown in Ap-
pendix D.2. We introduce the milestone matching
process with more details in Appendix A.6.
Milestone evaluation combines the best of both
worlds. As shown in Figure 1, it allows for explain-
able evaluation metrics like tool call AST matching
and execution result exact match found in BFCL,
while retaining the flexibility to evaluate any possi-
ble trajectory, similar to ToolEval.
On the other side of Milestones , there are Mine-
fields , which define events that must NOT occur, as
shown in Figure 3. This is mainly used in scenarios
where we test that an agent understands that it can-
not complete a task with the given tools instead of
hallucinating. Minefields are otherwise identical to
Milestones , except when the final trajectory similar-
ity score is calculated. Assuming using Equation
2 we found the similarity score score M−for mine-
field DAG GM−(VM−, EM−), the final similarity
score of the trajectory would be
score =score M+×I(score M−= 0),(1)
ensuring if minefields are violated (non-zero mine-
field similarity), the similarity score for the whole
trajectory is 0.
Figure 3: Example GPT-4 trajectory for Insufficient In-
formation category Minefield Evaluation. This task is
impossible to complete due to the current timestamp
not being available. Because of this, the model should
never call the tool timestamp_diff , since any argument
provided is bound to be incorrect. GPT-4 hallucinated
the current timestamp and called timestamp_diff , match-
ing the minefield, resulting in a similarity score of 0.

TOOLSANDBOX contains 1032 test cases metic-
ulously crafted by 2 internal domain experts to
capture challenging tool-use scenarios, with hu-
man authored and carefully calibrated Milestones
and Minefields to support evaluation. 1 annotator
is tasked to create test scenarios, while the other
acts as an agent to validate milestones and mine-
fields. We designed a rigorous annotation process
to ensure coverage across realistic, complex use
case scenarios, detailed in Appendix B.2. Statistics
comparison between TOOLSANDBOX and other
benchmarks can be found in Table 3. Tools in
TOOLSANDBOX are designed to be representative,
diverse and composable in conversational dialogs,
while making tool count manageable for milestone
annotation. As a result, TOOLSANDBOX test sce-
narios contain on average much higher number of
tool calls and turns per dialog compared to other
benchmarks. Additional details about tool domain
coverage and design principles can be found in
Appendix B.3.
To closely inspect the intricate challenges in
LLM tool-use applications, test scenarios are or-
ganized into detailed categories, statistics can be
found in Appendix B.4. A test scenario is defined
5
by the initial world state, the initial messages, the
available tools and the evaluation milestone and
minefields. Variations of test scenarios are also
introduced using the tool augmentations described
in 2.1. Scenarios are organized by the following
categories:
Single / Multiple Tool Call These categories ap-
ply to scenarios where one / multiple tool calls
are needed to fulfill the user task. Examples are
shown in Appendix C.2. Note that this definition
is different from the Berkeley Function-Calling
leaderboard (Yan et al., 2024), which resembles
distraction tools in TOOLSANDBOX described in
Section 2.1.
Single / Multiple User Turn In the single user
turn category, the first user message provides
all necessary information to complete the task,
whereas multiple user turn scenarios start with an
ambiguous request or missing information, requir-
ing further clarification from the user. An example
is shown in Appendix C.2.
State Dependency The state dependency cate-
gory describes scenarios where successful tool ex-
ecution depends on the world state, e.g. settings
like cellular service. The world state can be mod-
ified by the agent through the use of another tool.
Thus, an implicit dependency is formed between
the tools, which can only be discovered through
trial and error, as shown in Figure 1. There can
even be nested state dependencies. As shown in
Figure 19, sending a message would require cellu-
lar service to be turned on, but turning on cellular
service requires low battery mode to be turned off.
This requires the agent to implicitly keep track of a
call stack, and backtrack when necessary to fulfill
the task efficiently.
Canonicalization Canonicalization refers to the
process of transforming surface form representa-
tion commonly seen in a natural language query,
to its corresponding canonical form, similar to IN-
FORM dialog act in Schema Guided Dialog (Ras-
togi et al., 2020). This is particularly crucial when
an API is less intelligent, and requires canonical
form as argument. In some cases, canonicalization
can be performed by the model itself, for exam-
ple transforming 1Bto1_000_000_000 , or$to
corresponding ISO 4217 currency code USD . How-
ever, there are also cases where canonicalization
requires the help of tools, for example transform-
ingthis Friday to5/24/2024 , which requires knowl-edge about the current date, or transforming Golden
Gate Bridge to the latitude longitude pair (37.8199,
-122.4786) , which requires a lookup in an external
knowledge base. This scenario category captures
both cases, probing the Agent’s ability to perform
canonicalization with or without the aid of tools.
Insufficient Information The insufficient infor-
mation category is used for scenarios where the
agent is not able to perform the task on purpose,
by withholding a tool that would be needed for the
task. This category exercises if the agent is able
to identify that it cannot complete the task, as op-
posed to hallucinating tools or tool arguments, as
shown in Figure 3. In these scenarios, minefields
are defined to evaluate if tools that would imply
hallucination are called or not. Comparing to rel-
evance detection in BFCL where provided tools
are often irrelevant to the task at hand, this is a
much more challenging scenario, which requires
the agent to reason over highly relevant tools to
figure out the missing pieces. Comparing to solv-
ability in ToolEval, which assumes full credit for
any task deemed unsolvable, this is much more
fine-grained, testing if the agent would hallucinate
when the task is unsolvable.
4 Evaluation Results
Open Source Models Table 4 shows the aver-
age similarity for each of the scenario categories
described in Section 3 and tool augmentations de-
scribed in Section 2.1. There is a significant per-
formance gap between proprietary and open source
models, with the best performing open source
model Hermes (interstellarninja et al.) lagging
more than 20 points behind the second to last pro-
prietary model Claude-3-Haiku (Anthropic, 2024).
This is partly due to the fact that models like Go-
rilla (Patil et al., 2023) and Command-R (Cohere
and for AI, 2024) are incapable of consuming tool
responses, as shown in Appendix D.1. They can
theoretically solve Single Tool Call test scenarios,
but would fail in any scenario that requires multi-
ple tool calls. As for Hermes and Mistral (Jiang
et al., 2023), both models struggle at identifying
when a tool call should be issued. Mistral for exam-
ple would often mistake a tool-use scenario for a
code generation task, as shown in Figure 11. These
models’ subpar performance unexpectedly caused
them to achieve higher rating in the Insufficient
Information category, which rewards the model for
not generating hallucinated tool calls or arguments

when provided tools are insufficient to complete
the task. This should be considered a side effect
instead of a positive outcome.
Proprietary Models Of the proprietary models,
GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) achieves the highest sim-
ilarity score, with Claude-3-Opus closely behind.
Both models have their own strengths. While GPT-
4o achieves the higher score, Claude-3-Opus main-
tains a lower average turn count as shown in Ap-
pendix D.2, achieving the user goal with higher
efficiency. Interestingly, comparing the largest and
smallest models in the GPT, Claude and Gemini
families (Reid et al., 2024), Multiple Tool Call and
Multiple User Turn categories deteriorate much
faster than Single Tool Call and Single User Turn,
showing that reasoning about complex tool call
sequences and ambiguous user requests requires
much more model capacity.
State Dependency The State Dependency cat-
egory shows an interesting trend where, larger
models like GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and
Claude-3-Opus perform significantly worse than
mid to smaller sized models like GPT-3.5-Turbo
and Claude-3-Sonnet. This is due to erroneous
parallel tool calls in face of state dependency. As
mentioned in Section 2.2, the Execution Environ-
ment always surfaces race conditions when present.
Larger models like GPT-4 and Claude-3-Opus are
prune to issuing parallel tool calls even for depen-
dent tools, leading to a performance deficiency. An
example is shown in Figure 17. Nested state depen-
dency is also tricky to solve efficiently. As shown
in Figure 18, models often forget about open issues
and would not optimally backtrack, leading to re-
peated errors and as a result a much higher thanoptimal turn count.
Canonicalization Canonicalization remains a
challenging category for all models, especially
in tool assisted canonicalization. Larger models
would tend to memorize world knowledge that is
unlikely to change, like latitude longitude for fa-
mous geographical location, while smaller models
are more keen on using tools.
However, time related arguments in specific
show to be really challenging to canonicalize and
reason about. Models would frequently hallucinate
timestamps (Figure 15), and incorrectly canonical-
ize relative date and time (Figure 14).
In addition, models could take premature deci-
sions in face of ambiguity, also leading to canon-
icalization errors. In Figure 16, multiple location
entities were returned in the tool response, while
the model simply chose the first one, without re-
turning to the user for disambiguation.
Insufficient Information Insufficient Informa-
tion performance overall negatively correlates with
other categories. The stronger the model perfor-
mance on complex tasks, the worse the insufficient
information performance, showing its value at eval-
uating model reasoning capabilities. Even with
simple tasks and very little tools, top performing
models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 could hal-
lucinate tool name, or hallucinate arguments, as
shown in Figure 3 and 20. The test scenario’s diffi-
culty positively","ToolSandbox is a new way to test how well large language models can use various tools and applications to solve problems. Unlike previous benchmarks that only looked at single, isolated tasks, ToolSandbox is designed to be more realistic and comprehensive . The key features of ToolSandbox include: Stateful : The benchmark keeps track of the model's ""memory"" and previous actions, allowing for more complex, multi-step scenarios. Conversational : The interaction between the model and the benchmark is designed to feel like a natural conversation, rather than a series of disconnected prompts. Interactive : The model can actively engage with the benchmark, requesting information, making decisions, and taking actions, rather than just passively responding to questions. By incorporating these features, ToolSandbox aims to provide a more accurate assessment of a model's real-world tool use capabilities, beyond just its ability to perform isolated tasks."
12,Imagen 3,"overall preference, (ii) visual quality, and (iii) prompt-image alignment. We start by comparing each
new model to Imagen 3-001 (previous best Elo score) and computing their preliminary Elo score. We
then run side-by-side comparisons of each model against the four better and four worse models in
terms of Elo scores. We aggregate all these side-by-side comparisons into our final results, which we
show in Figure 14. Imagen 3-002 has the best Elo scores in all three quality aspects.
D.2. Qualitative Results
Figure 15 shows some qualitative results showcasing Imagen 3-002’s capabilities. The prompts that
were used to generate these images are, from left to right, and top to bottom:
•A vibrant illustration showcases a young anime girl clinging tightly to a fuzzy purple dragon as it soars through
a fantastical sky. The girl, with her signature large, expressive eyes and bright, flowing hair, is rendered in a
dynamic pose, her body leaning forward against the wind as she grips the dragon’s back. The dragon itself is a fluffy,
whimsical creature, its purple fur rendered with a soft, almost plush texture. They fly through a sky filled with fluffy
pink clouds, glittering sparkles, and a vibrant rainbow arcing across the scene. The colors are bright and saturated,
contributing to the magical and whimsical quality of the illustration. The overall mood is one of joyful, carefree
adventure, emphasizing the fantastical nature of the scene and the playful bond between the girl and her unusual
mount. The style is distinctly anime, with exaggerated features and a focus on dynamic movement and bright, bold
colors.
•Captured in the style of a high-budget animated film with vibrant, painterly textures, the frame reveals an expansive
celestial landscape filled with glowing nebulae in vivid purples, blues, and golds. The protagonist, a small female
figure clad in a flowing cape adorned with star motifs, stands at the edge of a crystalline cliff. Below, rivers of molten
stardust wind through the galaxy, their golden light shimmering dynamically. Towering constellations shaped like
mythical beasts hover in the background, their forms traced in glowing, dotted lines. Shooting stars streak across
the vast sky, adding motion and brilliance to the scene. The camera angle is slightly elevated, capturing both the
scale of the galaxy and the intimate journey of the protagonist.
•A close-up, macro photography stock photo of a strawberry intricately sculpted into the shape of a hummingbird in
mid-flight, its wings a blur as it sips nectar from a vibrant, tubular flower. The backdrop features a lush, colorful
garden with a soft, bokeh effect, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The image is exceptionally detailed and captured
with a shallow depth of field, ensuring a razor-sharp focus on the strawberry-hummingbird and gentle fading of
the background. The high resolution, professional photographers style, and soft lighting illuminate the scene in a
very detailed manner, professional color grading amplifies the vibrant colors and creates an image with exceptional
clarity. The depth of field makes the hummingbird and flower stand out starkly against the bokeh background.
•A close-up shot captures a winter wonderland scene – soft snowflakes fall on a snow-covered forest floor. Behind a
frosted pine branch, a red squirrel sits, its bright orange fur a splash of color against the white. It holds a small
hazelnut. As it enjoys its meal, it seems oblivious to the falling snow.
•An extreme close-up of a craftsperson’s hands shaping a glowing piece of pottery on a wheel. Threads of golden,
luminous energy connect the potter’s hands to the clay, swirling dynamically with their movements. The workspace
is filled with rich textures—dusty shelves lined with tools, scattered clay fragments, and beams of natural light
piercing through wooden shutters. The interplay of light and energy creates an ethereal, almost magical atmosphere
•A foggy 1940s European train station at dawn, framed by intricate wrought-iron arches and misted glass windows.
Steam rises from the tracks, blending with dense fog. Two lovers stand in an emotional embrace near the train,
backlit by the warm, amber glow of dim lanterns. The departing train is partially visible, its red tail lights fading
into the mist. The woman wears a faded red coat and clutches a small leather diary, while the man is dressed in a
weathered soldier’s uniform. Dust motes float in the air, illuminated by the soft golden backlight. The atmosphere is
melancholic and timeless, evoking the bittersweet farewell of wartime cinema.

•A low-angle close-up shot, in stark black and white, focuses on a woman with a short, precisely cut bob. Her
expression is one of deep concern; her eyebrows are slightly furrowed, her mouth drawn into a thin line, and her
eyes hold a worried intensity. The high contrast of the black and white photography emphasizes the texture of her
skin and the lines around her eyes, accentuating her worried expression. The background is a blurred but imposing
array of tall skyscrapers, their forms rendered in varying shades of grey, creating a sense of depth and scale. The low
angle, shooting upwards, emphasizes her upward gaze, suggesting a sense of being overwhelmed by the weight
of her worries within the vast urban landscape. The overall mood is one of serious apprehension, a powerful and
poignant image of a woman grappling with anxieties within a monumental city.
•A portrait of an Asian woman with neon green lights in the background, shallow depth of field.

Abstract
In this work, we address the problem of eavesdropping on dig-
ital video displays by analyzing the electromagnetic waves that
unintentionally emanate from the cables and connectors, partic-
ularly HDMI. This problem is known as TEMPEST. Compared to
the analog case (VGA), the digital case is harder due to a 10-bit
encoding that results in a much larger bandwidth and non-linear
mapping between the observed signal and the pixel’s intensity. As
a result, eavesdropping systems designed for the analog case ob-
tain unclear and difficult-to-read images when applied to digital
video. The proposed solution is to recast the problem as an inverse
problem and train a deep learning module to map the observed
electromagnetic signal back to the displayed image. However, this
approach still requires a detailed mathematical analysis of the sig-
nal, firstly to determine the frequency at which to tune but also
to produce training samples without actually needing a real TEM-
PEST setup. This saves time and avoids the need to obtain these
samples, especially if several configurations are being considered.
Our focus is on improving the average Character Error Rate in text,
and our system improves this rate by over 60 percentage points
compared to previous available implementations. The proposed
system is based on widely available Software Defined Radio and
is fully open-source, seamlessly integrated into the popular GNU
Radio framework. We also share the dataset we generated for train-
ing, which comprises both simulated and over 1000 real captures.
Finally, we discuss some countermeasures to minimize the potential
risk of being eavesdropped by systems designed based on similar
principles.

1 Introduction
TEMPEST is a term used to describe the unintentional emanation
of sensitive or confidential information from electrical equipment.
While it may refer to any kind of emissions, such as acoustic and
other types of vibrations [ 31], it primarily deals with electromag-
netic waves. In particular, this article focuses on electromagnetic
emissions from video displays. The issue of inferring the content
displayed on a monitor from the electromagnetic waves emitted by
it and its connectors has a long history, dating back to the 1980s
with the first public demonstrations by Win van Eck. This problem
is sometimes referred to as Van Eck Phreaking , but for the remainder
of this article, we will use the term TEMPEST [29].
Van Eck’s research was focused on the then-prevalent CRT mon-
itors. However, Markus Kuhn’s work in the early 2000s [ 15] studied
modern digital displays, including both the analog interface VGA
(Video Graphics Array) and the digital interfaces HDMI (High-
Definition Multimedia Interface) or DVI (Digital Visual Interface).
Nevertheless, reproducing these studies was challenging due to the
need for expensive and specialized hardware, such as a wide-band
AM receiver. This entrance barrier has been significantly reduced
in recent years by the development of Software Defined Radio
(SDR) [ 30]. SDR employs generic hardware that down-converts the
signal to baseband and then provides the sampled signal to the PC,
making the hardware more affordable and signal processing sim-
pler, since it is performed in software. This advantages resulted in
two open-source implementations of TEMPEST ( TempestSDR [21]
andgr-tempest [17]) and several empirical studies of the problem,
particularly focusing on the HDMI interface [ 4–6,10,18–20,24,28].
However, despite all of these efforts “ this threat still is not well-
documented and understood ” [4]. Our first contribution is precisely
to address this issue by providing an analytical expression of the
signal’s complex samples as received by the SDR when spying on
an HDMI display. Virtually all of the above-mentioned studies use
an AM demodulation step as part of their processing chain, similar
to the first studies by Van Eck with VGA, with the exception of [ 4],arXiv:2407.09717v1 [cs.CR] 12 Jul 2024
Submitted, 2024, Santiago Fernández, Emilio Martínez, Gabriel Varela, Pablo Musé, and Federico Larroca
which experimentally observed that by using FM demodulation, the
attacker may also obtain significant information on the display’s
content. As we will see, our analytical model explains why both the
magnitude and the phase of the complex samples provide informa-
tion on the eavesdropped image. Furthermore, these expressions
are crucial when setting up the eavesdropping system to choose
the frequency one should tune to in order to get maximum energy.
Instead of tuning the SDR to the frequency that obtains the best
Signal-to-Noise Ratio through trial-and-error (as in [ 18–20]), the
frequencies to be tested for a particular screen are manageable
when based in our analysis.
Equipped with this model, our second contribution is to re-cast
the TEMPEST problem as an inverse one. That is, recovering the
source image from the baseband complex samples gathered from the
SDR. Motivated by the success of deep learning in solving inverse
problems in other contexts [ 23], we propose designing and training
a deep convolutional neural network to infer the source image from
the baseband complex samples.
To our knowledge, three other works propose deep learning-
based algorithms for TEMPEST attacks [ 10,18,19]. Our work differs
significantly, overcoming some limitations of these previous studies.
In [19], the focus is on smartphone displays rather than HDMI or
DVI, which emit much lower power signals. They classified almost
unintelligible images from TempestSDR into digits, a simpler 10-
class classification task. The works in [ 18] and [ 10] target HDMI
but are less applicable to realistic scenarios, processing patches
with only a few characters. They both apply a denoiser to the
grayscale images produced by TempestSDR . Another relevant work
is [20], which reconstructs images from electromagnetic emissions
of embedded cameras. They used a modified TempestSDR and a
GAN-based image translator to restore spied images, offering a
potential adaptation to TEMPEST attacks.
More in particular, our contributions in this respect are twofold.
Firstly, we have developed and publicly shared an open-source im-
plementation of an end-to-end deep-learning architecture. Figure
1 presents an illustrative diagram of the system, including an ex-
ample of actual results. Our primary focus is on the restoration of
text. Our architecture surpasses vanilla implementations of either
TempestSDR orgr-tempest , producing significantly higher-quality
reconstructed images, achieving over 60 percentage points reduc-
tion in the average Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, and
based on the insights provided by our analytical model, we avoid
the AM demodulation step all previous works use (as they are based
onTempestSDR ), which further distorts the signal, and instead learn
to map directly from the complex samples to the original image;
i.e. solve the inverse problem. As we report in Sec. 6, using the
complex samples and avoiding the information loss incurred in
demodulation results in a significant gain in performance.
Secondly, we have made this article’s complete dataset pub-
licly available. It includes two sources of data: several real-life
signals and a GNU Radio-based simulator, which we developed
and are sharing, that, given an image, produces the spied sig-
nal. This simulator is based on the analytical expressions derived
in this work. Furthermore, we discuss how to train the learning
module (partially) based on these simulations, significantly re-
ducing the time-consuming stage of acquiring real-life signals
without negatively impacting the quality of the recovered images.

emit unintended electromagnetic signals, which are cap-

a degraded complex-valued image, which in turn is fed to a
convolutional neural network to infer the source image. All
three images correspond to actual results.
The full dataset comprises around 3500 samples, out of which
approximately 1300 are real captures. Our aim is to make this
openness useful in further advancing research in this area. Please

The rest of the article is structured as follows. The next sec-
tion discusses the threat model, whereas Sec. 3 provides a detailed
overview of the HDMI signal. In Sec. 4, we summarize the working
principle of SDR and characterize the forward operator by giving a
mathematical expression of the samples produced by the hardware
given an input image. How to recover the image from these sam-
ples by means of deep learning is discussed in Sec. 5. The obtained
results and countermeasures are presented in Secs. 6 and 7. Closing
remarks and future work are discussed in Sec. 8.
2 Threat Model
This section presents the threat model we consider in this work.
The attacker’s objective is to recover the image displayed on a
monitor that contains sensitive or confidential information. This
monitor is connected through a standard digital display interface,
which may be either HDMI or DVI. To achieve their objective, the
attacker will resort to the electromagnetic energy emanating from
the connectors and cables of the digital display, from which they
will infer the monitor’s content.
Deep-TEMPEST: Using Deep Learning to Eavesdrop on HDMI from its Unintended Electromagnetic Emanations Submitted, 2024,
We assume that the attacker is equipped with off-the-shelf hard-
ware to capture and process these emanations. The necessary equip-
ment includes a laptop with a GPU (although a CPU-only laptop is
a viable, albeit slower, alternative), an SDR hardware (see Sec. 4 for
a discussion), an antenna, and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).
We foresee two separate operational scenarios. Firstly, one where
the attacker remains unnoticed, e.g., if the spied system is close to
a wall and the attacker operates from the other side. In this case,
the setup may include somewhat large directive antennas, and an
online operation is viable where, for instance, the attacker adjusts
the antenna’s direction until a proper image is obtained and only
saves the images that they are interested in.
A second scenario is one where only the attacker’s hardware
goes unnoticed. For instance, a small omnidirectional antenna is
left near the HDMI cable and connectors of the spied system, and
the spying PC is not visible or does not draw attention. In this
case, which requires physical proximity to the spied system, the
attacker’s PC may periodically (e.g., every second) record a signal,
process it to obtain an image, and save it for offline visualization.
If hard drive space is not an issue, the attacker may even record
the raw samples of the SDR periodically and apply our method to
these recordings.
3 Unintended Electromagnetic Emanations of
HDMI
3.1 Digital signal
Although there are seven different versions of HDMI (ranging from
1.0 up to 2.1) and five types of connectors (A to E), video is encoded
the same way for all of them except for version 2.1. This last version,
released in 2017, is typically used only in high-end TVs with 4k
or 8k video, and we will not consider it in this work. In any case,
HDMI is backward compatible with single-link DVI, so our results
are also valid for DVI-D or DVI-I.
To transmit audio and video, HDMI uses three separate TMDS
channels, each corresponding to the red, blue, and green compo-
nents regarding video, where each channel is sent serially over
three separate pins (positive, negative, and ground; further details
regarding the electrical signal are presented in the next subsection).
While𝑌𝐶𝑏𝐶𝑟pixel encoding and other color depths are possible,
the default configuration is 𝑅𝐺𝐵 encoding with 24 bits. We will thus
only consider this configuration for brevity, although extensions
to these scenarios are straightforward. As illustrated in Fig. 2, and
just as in VGA, each video frame includes a horizontal and vertical
blanking, where no video is transmitted. During these periods, au-
dio or control packets are transmitted instead (the so-called control
and data island periods).
This means that the pixel rate is actually higher than what is
being displayed. For instance, for a resolution of 1920×1080 with
progressive scan, there are actually 2200×1125 pixels per frame
(including blanking). In terms of the notation of Fig. 2, this means
that𝑝𝑥=1920 ,𝑝𝑦=1080 ,𝑃𝑥=2200 and𝑃𝑦=1125 , which at a
frame rate of 60 Hz represents a pixel rate of 1/𝑇𝑝=148.5MHz. Sup-
ported resolutions and the corresponding timings may be consulted
at the EIA/CEA-861 standard, but it is important to note that the
possibilities are limited (e.g. 197 possible timings and resolutions
in HDMI 2.0, and only 64 for HDMI 1.4).
Figure 2: An illustration of the transmission of a frame on a
single TMDS channel. The red arrow indicates the order in
which the signal is transmitted. Video is actually sent only
during the video data periods.
Different from VGA, the intensity of each color (from 256 possible
values) is encoded into 10 bits before transmission. The 8-bit input
word is first differentially XORed or XNORed using the first bit as
the reference. The encoder uses the operation that results in fewer
bit transitions given the input word, and the choice is indicated in
the ninth bit. The second stage negates or not the first 8 bits (flagged
by the tenth bit) to even out 1s and 0s in the encoded stream. Note
that each video data period is encoded independently, meaning that
the process is restarted for each line.
3.2 Electrical and electromagnetic signal
After analyzing the digital signal generated by the video, we can
now examine the resulting electromagnetic signal surrounding the
cable. Our main interest is to determine where the largest portion
of its power lies in the spectrum so we can tune our system to that
frequency. Additionally, we want to obtain an approximate expres-
sion of this electromagnetic signal, which will help us simulate it.
This will enable us to produce samples that we can use to train and
evaluate our learning system without necessarily using an actual
TEMPEST setup. We will defer this last problem to the next section
since it also includes the effects of the SDR hardware.
HDMI uses differential signaling, basically meaning that every
channel is composed of two cables, where the bit value is estimated
from the difference in voltage between the two. That is to say, for
any of the three TMDS channels, the voltage signal 𝑥+(𝑡)and𝑥−(𝑡)
in both cables would be:
𝑥+(𝑡)=𝑉𝑐𝑐+∑︁
𝑘𝑥𝑏[𝑘]𝑝(𝑡−𝑘𝑇𝑏), (1)
𝑥−(𝑡)=𝑉𝑐𝑐−∑︁
𝑘𝑥𝑏[𝑘]𝑝(𝑡−𝑘𝑇𝑏), (2)
where𝑉𝑐𝑐is a constant, 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]corresponds to the mapping of 𝑘-th
bit (e.g. a negative voltage for 0 and a positive one for 1), 𝑇𝑏is the
bit duration, and 𝑝(𝑡)is the shaping pulse (typically a rectangular
pulse of duration 𝑇𝑏).
The immediate consequence is that under an ideal system and
observing both cables together as in our case, we would mea-
sure𝑥(𝑡)=𝑥+(𝑡)+𝑥−(𝑡)=2𝑉𝑐𝑐,which is independent of the
information-carrying sequence 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]. However, as observed in pre-
vious works [ 28], the pulses in 𝑥+(𝑡)and𝑥−(𝑡)are not perfectly
aligned nor exactly the same. For instance, assuming that 𝑥−(𝑡)is
Submitted, 2024, Santiago Fernández, Emilio Martínez, Gabriel Varela, Pablo Musé, and Federico Larroca
delayed a time 𝜖𝑇𝑏with respect to 𝑥+(𝑡), we would obtain
𝑥(𝑡)=𝑥+(𝑡)+𝑥−(𝑡)=2𝑉𝑐𝑐+∑︁
𝑘𝑥𝑏[𝑘]𝑞(𝑡−𝑘𝑇𝑏), (3)
where𝑞(𝑡)=𝑝(𝑡)−𝑝(𝑡−𝜖𝑇𝑏). (4)
That is to say, ignoring the constant 2𝑉𝑐𝑐, a classic PCM (Pulse-
Code Modulation) signal with conforming pulse 𝑞(𝑡). By adding a
random delay to 𝑥(𝑡), we can study it as a Wide-Sense Stationary
signal whose Power Spectral Density (i.e. the expected power per
Hertz) has the following well-known expression:
𝑆𝑋(𝑓)=|𝑄(𝑓)|2
𝑇𝑏𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)=4 sin2(𝜋𝑓𝜖𝑇𝑏)
𝑇𝑏sinc2(𝑓𝑇𝑏)𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓),(5)
where𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)=Í
𝑙𝑅𝑋𝑏[𝑙]𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑙𝑇 𝑏and𝑅𝑋𝑏[𝑙]=E{𝑥𝑏[𝑘]𝑥𝑏[𝑘+
𝑙]}. That is to say, the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform 𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝜔)of
the auto-correlation of the sequence 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]evaluated at 𝜔=2𝜋𝑓𝑇𝑏.
Note that𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)is a periodic function of period 1/𝑇𝑏(the bit rate).
It is typically the case that consecutive frames in the spied moni-
tor are very similar (if not identical). This is also true for contiguous
lines. Denoting as 𝑇𝑝the pixel time (i.e. 𝑇𝑝=10𝑇𝑏), and recalling
that each line is encoded independently, the previous two observa-
tions mean that high values of 𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)should be expected at mul-
tiples of𝑓=1/(𝑃𝑥𝑃𝑦𝑇𝑝)(the frame rate) as well as 𝑓=1/(𝑃𝑥𝑇𝑝)
(the horizontal lines rate). Furthermore, given that TMDS encoding
enforces no DC component, 𝑆𝑋𝑏(0)≈0.
The other relevant time scale is precisely 𝑇𝑝since consecutive
pixels are similar. Note that the analysis in this case is complicated
by the non-linear encoding we discussed before. As a first step, let
us consider a constant image, which produces at most two different
encoded words (the differentially encoded word or its negation),
which are sent alternately, the least significant bit first. This process
will produce a 𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)with large spikes at every multiple of 1/𝑇𝑝
since under a constant image, bits 10-bits apart are typically the
opposite (i.e. typically 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]=−𝑥𝑏[𝑘+10]). Another significant
spike should be present at 1/(2𝑇𝑝), too, since bits 20-bits apart are
typically the same.
This intuition is verified for more complex encoded images, as
shown in Fig. 3, which displays an estimation of 𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)for a TMDS
signal corresponding to eight frames of a user typing in a word
processor, multiplied by |𝑄(𝑓)|2/𝑇𝑏(cf. Eq. (5)) along with|𝑄(𝑓)|2
for reference (using 𝜖=0.002). Note that the significant increase in
𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)at𝑓≈0.05/𝑇𝑏=1/(2𝑇𝑝)is attenuated by|𝑄(𝑓)|2, whereas
the peaks every multiple of 0.1/𝑇𝑏=1/𝑇𝑝are not. The lower graph
in the figure displays a zoom-in to the third-pixel harmonic (marked
with a blue slashed rectangle), where the peaks corresponding to
multiples of 1/(𝑃𝑥𝑇𝑝)are clearly visible.
The conclusion of this section is that most of the power of the
emanations from an HDMI signal is located at the first few multiples
of the pixel rate. Naturally, the precise expression of 𝑞(𝑡)in(3)is
not known a priori. In (5), we have only assumed unaligned pulses
(with an unknown 𝜖), but other differences may also exist. Regarding
where most of the leaked power exists, a first approximation, like the
one we presented, is enough. Furthermore and quite interestingly,
as discussed in the following two sections, this expression will
also be enough to produce simulations that may be used to train
a learning system that maps samples of the emitted signal to the
source image that produced them.
Figure 3: The power spectral density of a TMDS encoded
signal computed by multiplying an estimation of 𝑆𝑋𝑏(𝑓)and
|𝑄(𝑓)|2/𝑇𝑏(the dashed red curve, shown for reference); cf.
Eq.(5). Both curves are normalized to its maximum value
for clarity. Significant spikes every multiple of 0.1/𝑇𝑏are
clearly visible. In the zoom-in around 𝑓=0.3/𝑇𝑏shown below,
smaller but nevertheless important spikes every multiple of
1/(𝑃𝑥𝑇𝑝)(the inverse of the duration of each horizontal line)
are also clearly visible.

samples𝑦[𝑙]whose real and imaginary parts correspond to
the in-phase and quadrature components.
4 Software Defined Radio
Having characterized our signal of interest 𝑥(𝑡)in(3), let us now
discuss how to intercept it and, furthermore, provide an analytic
expression to the signal captured by the SDR and thus the one we
may consider to perform the eavesdropping.
4.1 Hardware
As illustrated in Fig. 4, an SDR hardware moves the signal to base-
band and provides its filtered samples. These samples will be pro-
cessed using software to produce the eavesdropped image. Starting
from (3), and ignoring the constant term, we may interpret 𝑥(𝑡)as a
train of Dirac deltas that goes through a filter with impulse response
𝑞(𝑡). However, since we are down-converting this signal to base-
band, the complex baseband representation of this channel is actu-
ally a filter with impulse response 𝑔(𝑡)=F−1{𝑄(𝑓+𝑓𝑐)𝐻𝐿𝐹𝑃(𝑓)}
(see for example [9]). That is to say, the inverse Fourier transform
of the product between the Fourier transform of 𝑞(𝑡)moved to zero
from the tuning frequency 𝑓𝑐(which, as we discussed before, will
be equal to a harmonic of 1/𝑇𝑝) times the transfer function of the
SDR’s low-pass filter. If a sampling rate 𝑓𝑠is used, then 𝐻𝐿𝑃𝐹(𝑓)
is ideally zero for |𝑓|>𝑓𝑠/2and a constant otherwise. In other
words, instead of filtering the train of Dirac deltas with 𝑞(𝑡), we

use𝑔(𝑡), whose Fourier transform 𝐺(𝑓)is𝑄(𝑓)evaluated around
𝑓𝑐and zeroed for|𝑓|>𝑓𝑠/2. This process is illustrated in Fig. 5
using𝑞(𝑡)as defined in (4), 𝑓𝑐=3/𝑇𝑝and𝑓𝑠=1/(30𝑇𝑏).
All in all, after sampling, the following sequence is obtained:
𝑦[𝑙]=∑︁
𝑘𝑥𝑏[𝑘]𝑔(𝑙/𝑓𝑠−𝑘𝑇𝑏). (6)
We may further enrich the model by adding noise, small errors
to𝑓𝑐(instead of precisely a multiple of the pixel rate), and offsets
in both time and phase (uniform between zero and 1/𝑓𝑠or2𝜋,
respectively). These impairments are included in our simulations
to make the learning system more robust to these non-idealities.
Note, however, that we are ignoring the antenna’s bandwidth and
possible non-linearities.
Regarding the sampling rate, mid-level SDRs allow for, at most,
some tens of MHz. For example, the USRP 200-mini [ 7] we used
in our experiments has a maximum sampling rate of 𝑓𝑠=50MHz.
Just as in the example in Fig. 5, this is only a third of the pixel rate
at a resolution of 1920×1080@60Hz (resulting in 1/𝑇𝑝=148MHz),
meaning that each sample 𝑦[𝑙]will actually be a linear combination
of several tens of encoded bits, further complicating the image
reconstruction.
In fact, since the anti-aliasing filter of the SDR produces a 𝐺(𝑓)
that is zero for|𝑓|>𝑓𝑠/2, and if𝑓𝑠≪1/𝑇𝑏as we just discussed,
the resulting loss of information means that the attacker cannot
recover the sequence of bits 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]by observing the samples 𝑦[𝑙].
It may appear that a viable alternative is to increase the sampling
rate𝑓𝑠up to 1/𝑇𝑏, and after equalization, sample each bit separately
and decode the image. There are three important drawbacks to
this approach. Firstly, it would require an SDR that operates with
a sampling rate and a corresponding instantaneous bandwidth of
at least some GHz, which even high-end and extremely expensive
solutions struggle to provide (e.g. the USRP X440 by Ettus Research
provides up to 3200 MHz of bandwidth at the cost of over 25,000
dollars [ 8]). Secondly, it is unclear if the interference from other
sources (received due to the increased receiver’s bandwidth) will not
prove detrimental in recovering the image. Last but not least, there
is the problem of processing such an enormous amount of samples,
which would further impact the resulting cost of the spying setup,
this time in terms of the required PC.
For the above reasons, we will consider a sampling rate value 𝑓𝑠
as those obtained from less expensive (and also less conspicuous)
hardware, which will thus unavoidably result in an unrecoverablebit sequence 𝑥𝑏[𝑘]. However, recall that the attacker’s actual ob-
jective, as in any communications problem, is to estimate the most
plausible image that generated the observed complex sequence 𝑦[𝑙].
We propose a data-driven approach to this problem that leverages
thea priori information regarding what kind of images are typi-
cally displayed in a monitor (i.e., the original images used in the
training set should be representative of desktop content). This is
accomplished through a deep-learning module, which we present
in detail in the next section. Before that, the following subsection
discusses how, for the sake of simplicity, this estimation is simply
computed as|𝑦[𝑙]|inTempestSDR .
4.2 Software
Regarding software, samples are provided by the driver and then
processed arbitrarily by the spying PC. Both TempestSDR andgr-tempest
adapt the sampling rate 𝑓𝑠to produce an integer number of samples
for every𝑃𝑥pixels, i.e.,𝑃𝑥𝑇𝑝=𝑚/𝑓𝑠for some integer 𝑚. When
the sampling rate is successfully synchronized this way, these 𝑚
samples correspond to a line, and thus, displaying 𝑃𝑦of these lines
produces a non-skewed and static image. Correlations as the one
we discussed before are searched for in the signal and used in a
PLL-like system to estimate the precise value of 𝑓𝑠(see [ 17] and
[21] for details).
Given that (6)is a complex signal (as seen in Fig. 5, since |𝐺(𝑓)|
is not symmetric around zero), TempestSDR actually takes the mag-
nitude of the samples (i.e. an envelope detector, termed AM de-
modulator in some contexts, e.g. [ 20]), which further distorts the
signal. To avoid this unnecessary degradation, for the case of VGA
gr-tempest instead applies an equalization filter to the complex
signal to produce much better results. We will also consider the
complex signal so as to provide the learning system with the most
information available. As we will see, this choice will have a non-
negligible impact on the performance of the model.
The other significant difference between TempestSDR andgr-tempest
is that the former was coded from scratch, whereas the latter uses
GNU Radio [ 1]. This is a framework that represents a processing
chain as a series of interconnected blocks (a so-called flowgraph ),
each executing a well-defined operation on the signal (e.g. filter-
ing or resampling). New blocks can be easily created and added
to the already vast list of available ones. These new blocks can be
programmed either in C++ or Python. In the latter case, Numpy is
used to represent data, which further simplifies the integration of
deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, as in our case. All of
these features have been the main motivation behind our choice of
gr-tempest as the starting point of our system.

5.1 Deep Learning to Solve the Inverse Problem
In this section, we consider the inverse problem of recovering a
clean or source image 𝑿∈R𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥from a degraded observation
𝒀∈C𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥, which is an array of complex numbers with equal size
of the source image. This observation is modeled as:
𝒀=T(𝑿)+𝑵, (7)
Submitted, 2024, Santiago Fernández, Emilio Martínez, Gabriel Varela, Pablo Musé, and Federico Larroca
whereT:R𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥→C𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥is a non-linear degradation operator,
and𝑵∈C𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥is an additive complex noise, for which real and
imaginary parts are assumed to be mutually independent, each of
them being a white Gaussian noise image of variance 𝜎2. Recall
that in our case, 𝑿refers to a monitor image to be spied on (and
thus of shape 𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥), while 𝒀corresponds to an array of complex
samples defined by (6)and synchronized by gr-tempest . More
details on how we construct 𝑿and𝒀are discussed in the following
subsection.
Due to the aforementioned inter-symbol interference, the degra-
dation operatorTis severely ill-posed, so achieving perfect restora-
tion of 𝑿is impossible. Therefore, we must settle for obtaining an
estimation ˆ𝑿by introducing regularization and hope to get as close
as possible to the original image. This corresponds to performing
Bayesian estimation to solve a Maximum A Posteriori problem,
which can be formulated as follows:

ically, the data term is responsible for demanding similarity with
the degradation process, while the regularization term is composed
of a functionR:R𝑝𝑦×𝑝𝑥→R+that holds responsibility for deliv-
ering a stable solution. The proper choice of a regularizer is not a
trivial task as it involves considering prior knowledge of the kind
of images to be recovered. However, traditional","The paper describes a new method called ""Deep-TEMPEST"" that can use deep learning to eavesdrop on HDMI connections .

Abstract
In this paper, we introduce TimeGPT , the first foundation model for time series,
capable of generating accurate predictions for diverse datasets not seen during
training. We evaluate our pre-trained model against established statistical, ma-
chine learning, and deep learning methods, demonstrating that TimeGPT zero-shot
inference excels in performance, efficiency, and simplicity. Our study provides
compelling evidence that insights from other domains of artificial intelligence
can be effectively applied to time series analysis. We conclude that large-scale
time series models offer an exciting opportunity to democratize access to precise
predictions and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the capabilities of contemporary
advancements in deep learning.
1 Introduction
Uncertainty is an intrinsic aspect of life, a constant element that humans have tirelessly sought to
navigate and comprehend. From the traditions established by ancient civilizations to the sophisticated
research endeavors in our contemporary world, brilliant minds have ceaselessly strived to anticipate
the distribution of possible future events, crafting systematic approaches to unveil the prospective
future.
The aspiration to predict potential outcomes, foundational across a multitude of disciplines, reflects
a deep-seated human tendency to anticipate, strategize, and mitigate risks. The goal to reduce
uncertainty about what will come next maps to numerous real-world applications: from understanding
economic cycles and trends to discerning consumer consumption patterns; from optimizing electricity
demand for energy production and grid management to aligning capacity and infrastructure for
servers, workers, and machines.
Time series—data ordered chronologically—constitutes the underlying fabric of systems, enterprises,
and institutions. Its impact spans from measuring ocean tides to tracking the daily closing value of
the Dow Jones. This type of data representation is indispensable in sectors such as finance, healthcare,
meteorology, social sciences, and others, where discerning temporal patterns, trends, and cyclical
variations is crucial for forecasting future values and informing decision-making processes.
However, the current theoretical and practical understanding of time series hasn’t yet achieved a level
of consensus among practitioners that mirrors the widespread acclaim for generative models in other
fundamental domains of the human condition, like language and perception. Our field is still divided
in their assessment of the efficacy of deep learning for forecasting tasks. Efforts in forecasting science
have fallen short of fulfilling the promises of genuinely universal pre-trained models.
In this paper, we embark on a novel path and introduce TimeGPT , the first pre-trained foundation
model for time series forecasting that can produce accurate predictions across a diverse array of
domains and applications without additional training. A general pre-trained model constitutes a

groundbreaking innovation that opens the path to a new paradigm for the forecasting practice that is
more accessible and accurate, less time-consuming, and drastically reduces computational complexity.
2 Background
Regarding the superiority of deep learning approaches, the forecasting community is currently divided.
A unified approach has yet to be established. Recently, these diverging paradigms have increasingly
challenged each other, questioning the usefulness, accuracy, and complexity of new developments.
Despite the success of deep learning architectures in other fields, some time series practitioners have
demonstrated that some proposed innovations in the field don’t fulfill their claims or expectations.2
Historically, statistical methods such as ARIMA, ETS, MSTL, Theta, and CES have been reliably
employed across various domains. In the past decade, machine learning models like XGBoost and
LightGBM have gained popularity, demonstrating promising results in both public competitions and
practical applications.
However, with the advent of deep learning, a paradigm shift in time series analysis has occurred.
Deep learning methods have become popular in academia and for large-scale industrial forecasting
applications [Benidis et al., 2022].
Given their global approach, deep learning methods offer significant advantages over statistical local
methods in terms of scalability, flexibility, and potential accuracy. Additionally, their ability to learn
intricate data dependencies effectively bypasses the need for complex feature engineering necessary
for other global methods like LightGBM or XGBoost. Consequently, deep learning-based time series
models aim to simplify the forecasting pipeline and enhance scalability. Their ability to handle large
volumes of data and capture long-term dependencies positions them advantageously for complex
forecasting tasks in an era of ever-growing data volumes.
However, opinions among academic researchers and practitioners diverge regarding these promises.
Various researchers and practitioners have challenged the basic assumption of increased accuracy,
presenting evidence showing that simpler models outperform more sophisticated approaches; with
less cost and complexity. Conversely, some industry leaders report that the deep learning approach
has enhanced their results and simplified their analysis pipelines [Kunz et al., 2023].
In the current historical context, where the superior capabilities of deep learning models are undeniable
for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), it’s noteworthy that the time series
analysis field remains skeptical of the performance of neural forecasting methods.
We believe this skepticism arises from:
•Misaligned or poorly defined evaluation settings: Unlike other fields that have benefited
from the introduction of ideal testing datasets such as ImageNet for computer vision, the
publicly available datasets for time series do not possess the necessary scale and volume for
deep learning methods to excel.
•Suboptimal models: Given the limited and specific datasets, even well-conceived deep
learning architectures might struggle with generalization or require considerable effort to
find optimal settings and parameters.
Furthermore, the lack of standardized large-scale datasets that cater to the requirements of deep
learning methods could also be hindering progress in this area. While other fields have benefited from
benchmark datasets and clear evaluation metrics, the time series community still needs to develop
such resources to foster innovation and validate new techniques.3
In this paper, we demonstrate that larger and more diverse datasets enable more sophisticated models
to perform better across various tasks. TimeGPT is the first foundation model that consistently outper-
forms alternatives with minimal complexity. Further researching the improvements of foundation

forecasting the main claims remain valid. For further discussion see: [Smyl, 2020] and [Januschowski et al.,

3 Literature Review
Deep Learning forecasting models have become a prominent area of research, driven by their success
in recent famous competitions, including [Makridakis et al., 2020, 2022], and their applicability to
large-scale tasks in the industry. [Benidis et al., 2022] presents a comprehensive review and taxonomy
of neural forecasting models and their applications.
Initial Deep Learning time series forecasting successes stemmed from the adaptation of established
architectures, namely Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN),
initially designed for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), respectively.
RNNs served as the backbone for popular models like DeepAR [Salinas et al., 2020] for probabilistic
forecasting and the ESRNN [Smyl, 2020], winner of the M4 Competition. CNNs demonstrated
superior performance than RNNs in multiple tasks on sequential data, as shown in [Bai et al., 2018].
They now constitute a popular building block, as models like DPMN [Olivares et al., 2023b] and
TimesNet [Wu et al., 2022] use. Feed-forward networks, due to their low computational costs and
efficiency, are also frequently used, with notable examples including the N-BEATS [Oreshkin et al.,
2019, Olivares et al., 2022] and NHITS [Challu et al., 2023].
Transformer-based models [Vaswani et al., 2017] are gaining popularity in recent years, as they are
demonstrating remarkable performance in large-scale settings [Kunz et al., 2023] and complex tasks,
such as long sequence forecasting. The earlier examples include the TFT [Lim et al., 2021] and MQ-
Transformer [Eisenach et al., 2020], both with multi-quantile capabilities. The Informer introduced
Transformers for long sequence forecasting through the Prob-sparse self-attention mechanism [Zhou
et al., 2021]. This concept has since been further refined through various forms of inductive bias
and attention mechanisms in models like the Autoformer [Wu et al., 2021], FEDformer [Zhou et al.,
2022], and PatchTST [Nie et al., 2022].
The potential of foundation models, namely large-scale models pre-trained on a large dataset and later
fine-tuned for specific tasks, remains relatively under-explored for time series forecasting tasks. There
are, however, early indicators of the possibility of forecasting foundational models. For instance,
[Oreshkin et al., 2021] showed that pre-trained models can be transferred between tasks without
performance degradation. Additionally, [Kunz et al., 2023] provided evidence on the existence of
scaling laws on data and model sizes for Transformer architectures on time series forecasting tasks.
4 Foundation model for time series
Foundation models rely on their capabilities to generalize across domains, particularly in new datasets
that were not available during training. We understand, accordingly, transfer learning as the capacity
to apply knowledge gleaned from one task to solve new tasks. Next, we explain the concept of
transfer learning, building upon previous studies in time series forecasting [Oreshkin et al., 2021,
Olivares et al., 2023a].

P","The researchers have developed a new AI model called TimeGPT that can analyze and make predictions about time series data. Time series data is information that is collected over time, like stock prices or weather patterns. TimeGPT is the first ""foundation model"" specifically designed for time series data. Foundation models are large AI systems that can be adapted to solve a variety of tasks, similar to how a Swiss Army knife can be used for many different purposes. The researchers tested TimeGPT against other well-known statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods for time series analysis. They found that TimeGPT was better at making accurate predictions, was more efficient, and was simpler to use compared to the other approaches. This research shows that the powerful techniques developed in other areas of AI, like natural language processing, can also be applied effectively to time series data. The authors believe that large-scale time series models like TimeGPT have the potential to make precise predictions more accessible and help reduce uncertainty in a wide range of applications."

Abstract
We introduce phi-3-mini , a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens,
whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals
that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and
8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. Our training dataset
is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2 , composed of heavily filtered publicly available web
data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format.
We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-
3-small ,phi-3-medium , both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%,
78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context
capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini ,phi-3.5-MoE , and phi-
3.5-Vision . The phi-3.5-MoE , a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves
superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source
models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash
and GPT-4o-mini. Meanwhile, phi-3.5-Vision , a 4.2 billion parameter model derived from phi-3.5-
mini , excels in reasoning tasks and is adept at handling both single-image and text prompts, as well
as multi-image and text prompts.
1 Introduction
The striking progress of AI in the last few years can be largely attributed to major efforts through-
out the world towards scaling-up to ever-larger models and datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have steadily increased in size from a mere billion parameters just five years ago (GPT-2 had 1.5 bil-
lion parameters [RWC+19]) to trillion parameters today. The impetus for this effort originates in the
seemingly predictable improvement one obtains by training large models, the so-called scaling laws
[KMH+20, HBM+22, MRB+23]. However these laws assume a “fixed” data source. This assumption is
now significantly disrupted by the existence of frontier LLMs themselves, which allow us to interact with
data in novel ways. In our previous works on the phi models [GZA+23, LBE+23, JBA+23] it was shown
that a combination of LLM-based filtering of publicly available web data, and LLM-created synthetic
data, enable performance in smaller language models that were typically seen only in much larger mod-
els. For example our previous model trained on this data recipe, phi-2 (2.7B parameters), matched the
performance of models 25 times larger trained on regular data. In this report we present a new model,
phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters), trained for 3.3T tokens on larger and more advanced versions of the
datasets used in phi-2 . With its small size, phi-3-mini can easily be inferenced locally on a modern
phone (see Figure 2), yet it achieves a quality that seems on-par with models such as Mixtral 8x7B
[JSR+24] and GPT-3.5.

User: Explain why it is surprising that one can build a language model small enough to
fit on a phone, yet almost as powerful as ChatGPT. Just use one funny sentence.
phi-3-mini: It’s like fitting a supercomputer in a flip phone, but instead of breaking
the phone, it just breaks the internet with its tiny, yet mighty, linguistic prowess!
User: Okay now more serious answer, and note that this was achieved solely by changing
the training data.
phi-3-mini: The development of a compact language model that rivals the capabilities
of ChatGPT, while fitting on a phone, is a testament to the power of data-driven
machine learning. By meticulously curating and optimizing the training dataset,
researchers can significantly reduce the model’s size without compromising its
performance. [...]
2 Technical Specifications
Thephi-3-mini model is a transformer decoder architecture [VSP+17], with default context length 4 K.
We also introduce a long context version via LongRope [DZZ+24a] that extends the context length to
128K, called phi-3-mini-128K .
To best benefit the open source community, phi-3-mini is built upon a similar block structure as
Llama-2 [TLI+23] and uses the same tokenizer with vocabulary size of 320641. This means that all
packages developed for Llama-2 family of models can be directly adapted to phi-3-mini . The model
uses 3072 hidden dimension, 32 heads and 32 layers. We trained using bfloat16 for a total of 3.3T tokens.
The model is already chat-finetuned, and the chat template is as follows:
<|user|> /n Question <|end|> /n <|assistant|>
Thephi-3-small model (7B parameters) leverages the tiktoken tokenizer (for better multilingual
tokenization) with a vocabulary size of 1003522and has default context length 8192. It follows the
standard decoder architecture of a 7B model class, having 32 heads, 32 layers and a hidden size of 4096.
We switched to GEGLU activation and used Maximal Update Parametrization (muP) [YHB+22] to tune
hyperparameters on a small proxy model and transfer them to the target 7B model. Those helped ensure
better performance and training stability. Also, the model leverages a grouped-query attention, with
4 queries sharing 1 key. To optimize the training and inference speed, we design a novel blocksparse
attention module. For each attention head, the blocksparse attention enforces different sparsity patterns
over KV cache. This ensures that all tokens are attended to on different heads for the given choice of
sparsity. As illustrated in Figure 1, the context is then efficiently divided and conquered among attention
heads, with significant KV cache reduction. To achieve actual deployment speed-up from the blocksparse
design, we implemented highly efficient, yet flexible kernels for both training and inference. For training,
we build a triton kernel based on Flash Attention [DFE+22]. For inference, we implemented a kernel for
the prefilling phase and extended the paged attention kernel in vLLM for the decoding phase [KLZ+23].
Lastly, in phi-3-small architecture, we alternate dense attention layers and blocksparse attention layers
to optimize KV cache savings while maintaining long context retrieval performance. An additional 10%
multilingual data was also used for this model.
Thephi-3.5-MoE adopts an Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to selectively activate parts of
modules on specific inputs to improve the model efficiency. It incorporates MoE layer as its feedforward
models, employing the top2 routing among 16 expert networks. Particularly, each expert network is a
separate GLU network and the routing module will selectively activate 2 expert networks out of the
16 expert networks for each token, leaving 16 ×3.8B model to have 6.6B activated parameters with 42B
1We remove BoS tokens and add some additional tokens for chat template.
2We remove unused tokens from the vocabulary.

total parameters. Additionally, we utilize the SparseMixer approach [LGC23, LDL+23] for training the
sparse router in the MoE model. For comparison with other Phi series models, phi-3.5-MoE uses the
same tokenizer as phi-3-medium andphi-3-mini with vocabulary size of 32064.
Highly capable language model running locally on a cell-phone. Thanks to its small size, phi-
3-mini can be quantized to 4-bits so that it only occupies ≈1.8GB of memory. We tested the quantized
model by deploying phi-3-mini on iPhone 14 with A16 Bionic chip running natively on-device and fully
offline achieving more than 12 tokens per second.
Training Methodology. We follow the sequence of works initiated in “Textbooks Are All You
Need” [GZA+23], which utilize high quality training data to improve the performance of small language
models and deviate from the standard scaling-laws . In this work we show that such method allows to
reach the level of highly capable models such as GPT-3.5 or Mixtral with only 3.8B total parameters
(while Mixtral has 45B total parameters for example). Our training data of consists of heavily filtered
publicly available web data (according to the “educational level”) from various open internet sources, as
well as synthetic LLM-generated data. Pre-training is performed in two disjoint and sequential phases;
phase-1 comprises mostly of web sources aimed at teaching the model general knowledge and language
understanding. Phase-2 merges even more heavily filtered webdata (a subset used in Phase-1) with some
synthetic data that teach the model logical reasoning and various niche skills.
Data Optimal Regime. Unlike prior works that train language models in either “compute optimal
regime” [HBM+22] or “over-train regime”, we mainly focus on the quality of data for a given scale .3
We try to calibrate the training data to be closer to the “data optimal” regime for small models. In
particular, we filter the publicly available web data to contain the correct level of “knowledge” and keep
more web pages that could potentially improve the “reasoning ability” for the model. As an example, the
result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models,
but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for “reasoning” for the mini size
models. We compare our approach with Llama-2 in Figure 3.
To test our data on larger size of models, we also trained phi-3-medium , a model with 14B pa-
rameters using the same tokenizer and architecture of phi-3-mini , and trained on the same data for
slightly more epochs (4.8T tokens total as for phi-3-small . The model has 40 heads and 40 layers, with
embedding dimension 5120. We observe that some benchmarks improve much less from 7B to 14B than
they do from 3.8B to 7B, perhaps indicating that our data mixture needs further work to be in the “data
optimal regime” for 14B parameters model.
3Just like for “compute optimal regime”, we use the term “optimal” in an aspirational sense for “data optimal regime”.
We are not implying that we actually found the provably “optimal” data mixture for a given scale.

tokens per second.

small) versus Llama-2 family of models (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B) that were trained on the same fixed data. We plot
the log of MMLU error versus the log of model size.
4
Post-training. Post-training of phi-3 went through two stages, including supervised finetuning (SFT)
and direct preference optimization (DPO). SFT leverages highly curated high-quality data across diverse
domains, e.g., math, coding, reasoning, conversation, model identity, and safety. The SFT data mix
starts with using English-only examples. DPO data covers chat format data, reasoning, and responsible
AI (RAI) efforts. We use DPO to steer the model away from unwanted behavior, by using those outputs
as “rejected” responses. Besides improvement in math, coding, reasoning, robustness, and safety, post-
training transforms a language model to an AI assistant that users can efficiently and safely interact
with.
3 Academic benchmarks
On the next page we report the results for phi-3 on standard open-source benchmarks measuring the
model’s reasoning ability (both common sense reasoning and logical reasoning). We compare to phi-2
[JBA+23], Mistral-7b-v0.1 [JSM+23], Mixtral-8x7b [JSR+24], Gemma 7B [TMH+24], Llama-3-instruct-
8b [AI23], and GPT-3.5. All the reported numbers are produced with the exact same pipeline to ensure
that the numbers are comparable. These numbers might differ from other published numbers due to
slightly different choices in the evaluation. As is now standard, we use few-shot prompts to evaluate
the models, at temperature 0. The prompts and number of shots are part of a Microsoft internal tool
to evaluate language models, and in particular we did no optimization to the pipeline for the phi-3
models.4The number of k–shot examples is listed per-benchmark. An example of a 2-shot prompt is
described in Appendix A.
4For example, we found that using ## before the Question can lead to a noticeable improvement to phi-3-mini ’s
results across many benchmarks, but we did not do such changes in the prompts.

4 Multilingual and Long Context
To enhance the Phi-3 models with multilingual and long-context capabilities, we developed the ver-
sions phi-3.5-mini andphi-3.5-MoE , which incorporate more multilingual and long-text data during
mid-training. Specifically, we employed the long-rope method [DZZ+24a] and a mixed context window
approach to expand the context length limit from 4K to 128K without compromising performance on
4K-context tasks.
Figure 4 compares the performance of phi-3-mini ,phi-3.5-mini , and phi-3.5-MoE on MMLU
multilingual tasks. phi-3.5-mini demonstrates significant improvement over phi-3-mini in languages

such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese, with average MMLU-multilingual scores
of 55.4 and 47 .3, respectively. Due to its larger model capacity, phi-3.5-MoE achieves a significantly
higher average score of 69 .9, outperforming phi-3.5-mini .
Figure 4: Comparison of phi-3-mini ,phi-3.5-mini andphi-3.5-MoE on MMLU-Multilingual tasks
We evaluate the phi-3.5-mini andphi-3.5-MoE models on two long-context understanding tasks:
RULER [HSK+24] and RepoQA [LTD+24]. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, both phi-3.5-MoE andphi-
3.5-mini outperform other open-source models with larger sizes, such as Llama-3.1-8B, Mixtral-8x7B,
and Mixtral-8x22B, on the RepoQA task, and achieve comparable performance to Llama-3.1-8B on
the RULER task. However, we observe a significant performance drop when testing the 128K context
window on the RULER task. We suspect this is due to the lack of high-quality long-context data in
mid-training, an issue we plan to address in the next version of the model release.
In the table 3, we present a detailed evaluation of the phi-3.5-mini andphi-3.5-MoE models
compared with recent SoTA pretrained language models, such as GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and
open-source models like Llama-3.1-8B and the Mistral models. The results show that phi-3.5-mini
achieves performance comparable to much larger models like Mistral-Nemo-12B and Llama-3.1-8B, while
phi-3.5-MoE significantly outperforms other open-source models, offers performance comparable to
Gemini-1.5 Flash, and achieves above 90% of the average performance of GPT-4o-mini across various
language benchmarks.

5 Safety
Phi-3-mini was developed in accordance with Microsoft’s responsible AI principles. The overall ap-
proach consisted of safety alignment in post-training, red-teaming, automated testing and evaluations
across dozens of RAI harm categories. Helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets [BJN+22,
JLD+23] with modifications inspired by [BSA+24] and multiple in-house generated datasets were lever-
aged to address the RAI harm categories in safety post-training. An independent red team at Microsoft
iteratively examined phi-3-mini to further identify areas of improvement during the post-training pro-
cess. Based on their feedback, we curated additional datasets tailored to address their insights, thereby
refining the post-training dataset. This process resulted in significant decrease of harmful response rates,
as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Comparison of harmful response percentages by Microsoft AI Red Team between phi-3-mini before
and after the safety alignment. Note that the harmful response percentages in this chart are inflated numbers as
the red team tried to induce phi-3-mini in an adversarial way to generate harmful responses through multi-turn
conversations.
The safety alignment of phi-3-small ,phi-3-medium andphi-3.5-MoE was conducted by un-
dergoing the same red-teaming process, utilizing identical datasets, and incorporating a slightly larger
number of samples. Table 4 shows the results of in-house RAI benchmarks [MHJ+23] for phi-3 models
compared to phi-2 [JBA+23], Mistral-7b-v0.1 [JSM+23], Gemma 7b [TMH+24], and Llama-3-instruct-8b
[AI23]. This benchmark utilized GPT-4 to simulate multi-turn conversations in five different categories

measures if the information in a response is based on a given prompt. In other categories, responses
were evaluated in terms of the severity of harmfulness from 0 (no harm) to 7 (extreme harm) and the
defect rates (DR- x) were computed as the percentage of samples with the severity score being greater
than or equal to x.
6 Weakness
In terms of LLM capabilities, while phi-3-mini model achieves similar level of language understanding
and reasoning ability as much larger models, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks.
The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much “factual knowledge”, which can be seen
for example with low performance on TriviaQA. However, we believe such weakness can be resolved by
augmentation with a search engine. We show an example using the HuggingFace default Chat-UI with

phi-3-mini in Figure 6. Another weakness related to model’s capacity is that we mostly restricted the
language to English. Exploring multilingual capabilities for Small Language Models is an important
next step, with some initial promising results on phi-3-small by including more multilingual data.
Despite our diligent RAI efforts, as with most LLMs, there remains challenges around factual inaccu-
racies (or hallucinations), reproduction or amplification of biases, inappropriate content generation, and
safety issues. The use of carefully curated training data, and targeted post-training, and improvements
from red-teaming insights significantly mitigates these issues across all dimensions. However, there is
significant work ahead to fully address these challenges, and downstream use of the models should be
evaluated for the specific use cases and safety considerations for that context.
7 Phi-3.5-Vision
7.1 Technical Specifications
Architecture ThePhi-3.5-Vision (4.2B parameters) is a multimodal model designed to process an
image/multi-image and a textual prompt as inputs, and subsequently generate textual outputs. This
model is composed of two primary components: an image encoder, i.e., CLIP ViT-L/14 [RKH+21] and a
transformer decoder, i.e., phi-3.5-mini. The visual tokens, once extracted by the image encoder, are then
combined with text tokens in an interleaved way (no particular order for image and text tokens). To
accommodate high-resolution images and various aspect ratios, a dynamic cropping strategy [DZZ+24b] is
utilized to split the input image into a 2d array of blocks, where the tokens of the blocks are concatenated
to represent the whole image. For multi-image input, we simply concatenated tokens from each images
together.
Pre-training ThePhi-3.5-Vision model undergoes a pre-training phase using a diverse dataset,
which consists of a combination of interleaved image-text documents ( e.g., [LST+24]), image-text pairs
from FLD-5B [XWX+24], synthetic data derived from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of PDF
files, datasets for chart/table comprehension, and text-only data. The objective of predicting the next
token is employed specifically on text tokens, while any loss associated with image tokens is disregarded
during this phase. The pre-training process involves a total of 0 .5Ttokens that encompass both visual
and text elements. During the pre-training phase, the maximum image resolution is capped at 1344 ×1344
as the majority of the training images are smaller than this resolution.
Post-training. ThePhi-3.5-Vision model contains two post-training stages: supervised finetuning
(SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For SFT, we leveraged text SFT dataset, public multi-
modal instruct tuning datasets along with large-scale multimodal instruct tuning datasets that we built

held in Milano and Cortina in Italy, while the 2022 and 2018 Winter Olympic Games were held in Beijing, China
and PyeongChang, Korea, respectively. Without the search results, the response is incorrect, while with the web

ourselves, covering diverse domains and tasks such as general natural image understanding, chart/table/-
diagram understanding/reasoning, PowerPoint understanding, multi-image comparison, video summa-
rization and model safety. The multimodal SFT data has about a total of 33B tokens. For DPO we
mainly use a text DPO dataset and a relatively smaller-scale multimodal DPO dataset. For these two
stages, we jointly train multimodal tasks and text-only tasks so that the model can achieve multi-modal
reasoning while maintaining language capabilities as much as possible.
7.2 Academic benchmarks
7.2.1 Single-image Benchmarks
We report in Table 5 the evaluation results of Phi-3.5-Vision on nine open-source academic benchmarks.
These benchmarks evaluate reasoning and perceptual capabilities on visual and text inputs and can
be grouped in three categories: Science, Charts, and Generic knowledge. We compare Phi-3.5-Vision
with the following baselines: MM1-3B-Chat [MGF+24], MM1-7B-Chat [MGF+24], Llava-1.6 Vicuna
7B [LLLL23], Llava-1.6 Llama3-8B [LLL+24], Qwen-VL-Chat [BBY+23], Claude 3 Haiku [Ant24], Gemini
1.0 Pro V [TAB+23], and GPT-4O. Our performance quality assessment setup used the same evaluation
pipeline for all the baselines to ensure a fair comparison, with the exception of MM1-3B-Chat. We just
copied and pasted their published numbers since the model is not publicly available.
Our evaluation setup aimed to mimic scenarios where regular users interact with a multi-modal
model, i.e., users who are not experts in prompt engineering or know special techniques that can improve
performance. For this reason, we adopted the evaluation setting used in Llava-1.5 [LLLL23]. In this
12
setup, the prompts include instructions to select a single letter corresponding to an answer from a list
of given options, or answer with a single word or phrase. In our prompts, we did not use specific tokens
for multiple-choice questions. Moreover, we did not scale or pre-process any image in our benchmarking
system. We placed the images as the first item in the prompts, except on the MMMU dataset where
the prompts interleave the images anywhere in the question or the answers. Lastly, our evaluation
setup only considered a 0-shot format. Because of these evaluation parameters, our reported numbers
can differ from the published numbers of the considered baselines. As we can seen, our Phi-3.5-Vision
achieves super competitive results on all benchmarks and outperform other competitor models on most
benchmarks while being smaller.
7.2.2 Multi-image Benchmarks
We report in Table 6 the evaluation results of Phi-3.5-Vision on one latest academic multi-image bench-
mark and one video benchmark. These benchmarks evaluate perceptual capabilities on multiple im-
age/frames and text covering a wide range of general scenarios (e.g., Art and Style recognition, Forensic
detection, and video understanding). We compare Phi-3.5-Vision with the following baseline methods:
Llava Interleave-Qwen 7B [LZZ+24], InternVL2 4B and 8B [CWT+24], Gemini 1.5 Flash [TAB+23],
GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet [Ant24], Gemini 1.5 Pro [TAB+23], and GPT-4O. Line in the single-
frame evaluation case, our performance quality assessment setup used the same evaluation pipeline for
all the baselines to ensure a fair comparison.
Our evaluation setup for multi-image also followed the Llava setup where prompts include instructions
to select a single letter corresponding to an answer from a list of given options, or answer with a single
word or phrase. Moreover, we did not use specific tokens for multiple-choice questions and we did not
scale or pre-process any image in our benchmarking system. For most of the benchmarks, we placed the
images as the first item in the prompts.
The evaluation pipelines for BLINK and VideoMME benchmarks differ from those published. In
the case of BLINK, we do not use ChatGPT as the final answer selection mechanism. Instead, we
instruct the evaluated model to select one answer directly from the given choices. The reason is that
in this manner we ensure that the mistakes or successes come solely by the evaluated model. For the
VideoMME benchmark, we extracted 16 frames from the video by sampling frames at a given rate that
ensures a uniform time coverage of the entire","This research paper describes a new language model called Phi-3 that can run directly on a cell phone, without needing to connect to the internet or a remote server. Highly capable language models like GPT-3 have shown impressive abilities at tasks like answering questions, summarizing text, and generating human-like writing. However, these models are usually very large and require significant computing power to run, making them difficult to deploy on everyday mobile devices. The key innovation of Phi-3 is that it is designed to deliver high performance and capability while still being small enough to run locally on a cell phone. This means you could use advanced language AI features like natural language generation or question answering without needing an internet connection or cloud computing resources. The researchers achieved this by carefully optimizing the model architecture and training process to balance size, speed, and accuracy. If successful, Phi-3 could pave the way for a new generation of highly capable AI assistants that can run directly on our smartphones and other mobile devices, without the need to send our data to the cloud. This could have important implications for privacy, security, and accessibility, especially in areas with unreliable internet access. However, there are also technical challenges in making such a powerful model run efficiently on limited hardware."

performance. This can be achieved by augmenting LLMs with methods such as parallel sampling (Brown et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022) or symbolic tree search (Hao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Yao
et al., 2023) to enhance reasoning ability. Furthermore, OpenAI (2024); Guo et al. (2025) explore training
LLMs using reinforcement learning to generate long CoT, which often include self-reflection, verification, and
backtracking—processes commonly employed by humans when solving complex problems. This approach not
only innovates the training paradigm for LLMs but also provides a new form of training data to augment their
reasoning ability. Our work demonstrates that this long CoT exhibits high-quality characteristics in eliciting the
inherent reasoning abilities of LLMs.
6.3 Data Efficiency in Language Models
Zhou et al. (2024a) demonstrates that with just 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, models can learn
to follow specific formats and generalize well to unseen tasks. The findings emphasize the importance of quality
over quantity in the alignment process. However, whether this lesson can be applied to reasoning tasks remains
uncertain, given the potential high computational complexity of such tasks (Merrill and Sabharwal, 2024; Xiang
et al., 2025). While some work on reasoning highlights the importance of quality during the curation of training
data (Zhou et al., 2024b), the quantity of such data is still much larger compared to that in LIMA. Our work extends
the ideology of LIMA to reasoning tasks by investigating what constitutes high-quality questions and solutions, and
demonstrates that the reasoning ability of LLMs can be enhanced in a highly data-efficient manner.
7 Future Work
While LIMO demonstrates remarkable success in mathematical reasoning with minimal data, several promising
directions remain for future exploration.
Domain Generalization: First, extending the LIMO hypothesis to broader reasoning domains represents a critical
next step. While our work focuses on mathematical reasoning, the principles of high-quality reasoning chains could
potentially generalize to scientific reasoning, logical deduction, and causal inference. Understanding how these
principles transfer across domains could reveal universal patterns in effective reasoning. This exploration would
require adapting our quality metrics and developing domain-specific evaluation frameworks, ultimately contributing
to a more comprehensive theory of machine reasoning.
Theoretical Foundations: A deeper theoretical understanding of LIMO’s success is also essential. Future
research should focus on formalizing the relationship between pre-training knowledge, inference-time computation,
and reasoning capabilities. This includes investigating the minimum threshold of pre-trained knowledge required
for effective reasoning and developing mathematical models to predict the optimal balance between reasoning chain
12
quality and quantity. Such theoretical foundations could guide the development of more efficient training strategies
and provide insights into the fundamental nature of machine reasoning.
Automated Assessment: The development of automated quality assessment tools represents another crucial
direction. Current manual evaluation of reasoning chain quality, while effective, is time-consuming and difficult to
scale. Future work should focus on creating automated systems that can evaluate and improve reasoning chain
quality based on our proposed metrics. This could include developing algorithms that automatically enhance
existing reasoning chains and generate high-quality ones with minimal human intervention, making the LIMO
approach more accessible and scalable.
Multi-modal Integration: Cross-modal reasoning presents an exciting frontier for extending LIMO’s principles.
As real-world reasoning often involves multiple modalities, investigating how visual information and structured
data can enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities is crucial. This research direction would require developing
new quality metrics for multi-modal reasoning chains and understanding how different types of information can be
effectively integrated into the reasoning process.
Real-world Impact: The application of LIMO principles to real-world scenarios deserves significant attention.
Future work should focus on adapting these approaches to practical problems in education, scientific research, and
industrial applications. This includes developing specialized versions of LIMO for specific domains and creating
tools that help human experts generate high-quality reasoning chains for complex real-world problems. Such
applications could significantly impact how we approach problem-solving in various fields.
Cognitive Science Bridge: Finally, integrating insights from cognitive science could provide valuable directions
for improvement. Understanding the parallels between LIMO’s reasoning patterns and human cognitive processes
could inform the development of more effective reasoning strategies. This includes studying how different reasoning
approaches affect model performance and generalization, and incorporating cognitive science principles into the
design of reasoning chains. Such research could not only improve AI systems but also provide insights into human
reasoning processes.
These future directions collectively aim to deepen our understanding of efficient reasoning in large language mod-
els while expanding their practical applications. By pursuing these paths, we can work toward more sophisticated,
efficient, and widely applicable reasoning systems that better serve human needs across various domains.

Abstract
Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved
their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one
attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the
simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks
and models, we observe that coverage – the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated
sample – scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the
relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled
with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In
domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these
increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated
sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct
increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample
state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods
for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several
hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.
1 Introduction
The ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve coding, mathematics, and other reasoning
tasks has improved dramatically over the past several years [ 47,11,2,4]. Scaling the amount of
training compute through bigger models, longer pre-training runs, and larger datasets has been a
consistent driver of these gains [27, 37, 28].
In contrast, a comparatively limited investment has been made in scaling the amount of
computation used during inference. Larger models do require more inference compute than smaller
ones, and prompting techniques like chain-of-thought [ 61] can increase answer quality at the cost
of longer (and therefore more computationally expensive) outputs. However, when interacting
with LLMs, users and developers often restrict models to making only one attempt when solving a
problem.

Figure 1: The repeated sampling procedure that we follow in this paper. 1) We generate many independent candidate
solutions for a given problem by sampling from an LLM with a positive temperature. 2) We use a domain-specific
verifier (ex. unit tests for code) to select a final answer from the generated samples.
In this work, we explore repeated sampling (Figure 1) as a simple approach to scaling inference
compute in order to improve reasoning performance. Existing work provides encouraging examples
that repeated sampling can be beneficial in math, coding, and puzzle-solving settings [ 60,48,
23]. Notably, AlphaCode [ 41], a state-of-the-art system for competitive programming, finds that
performance continues to improve with a million samples per problem. Our goal is to systematically
characterize these benefits across a range of tasks, models, and sample budgets.
The effectiveness of repeated sampling is determined by two key properties:
1.Coverage: As the number of samples increases, what fraction of problems can we solve using
any sample that was generated?
2.Precision: How often can we identify correct samples from our collection of generations?
Both properties are needed for achieving strong real-world performance. With unlimited samples,
any model that assigns a non-zero probability to every sequence will achieve perfect coverage.
However, repeated sampling is only practical if we can improve coverage with a feasible budget.
Similarly, generating large sample collections is only useful if the correct samples in a collection can
be identified. The difficulty of the precision problem can vary by task. In some settings, existing
tools like proof checkers and unit tests can automatically verify every sample. In other cases, like
when solving word problems, other methods for verification are needed.
Exploring coverage first, we find that sampling up to 10,000 times per problem can significantly
boost coverage on math and coding tasks (Section 2). When solving CodeContests [ 41] programming
problems using Gemma-2B [ 52], we increase coverage by over 300x, from 0.02% with one sample to
7.1% with 10,000 samples. Interestingly, the relationship between log(coverage ) and the number of
samples often follows an approximate power law (Section 3). With Llama-3 [ 3] and Gemma models,
this leads to coverage growing nearly log-linearly with the number of samples over several orders of
magnitude.
In settings with automatic verification tools, increases in coverage translate directly into improved
task performance. When applying repeated sampling to competitive programming and writing
Lean proofs, models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct can exceed the single-sample performance of much
stronger ones like GPT-4o [ 2]. This ability to amplify weaker models extends to the challenging
SWE-bench Lite dataset of real-life GitHub issues [ 32], where the current single-sample state-of-the-
art (SOTA), achieved by a mixture of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is 43% [ 1]. When restricted to
a single sample, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct [ 20] solves only 15.9% of issues. By simply increasing
the number of samples to 250, we increase the fraction of solved issues to 56%, exceeding the
state-of-the-art by 13%.
In addition to improving model quality, repeated sampling provides a new mechanism for
minimizing LLM inference costs (Section 2.3). When holding the total number of inference FLOPs
2
constant, we find that on some datasets (e.g. MATH), coverage is maximized with a smaller model
and more samples, while on others (e.g CodeContests) it is better to sample fewer times from a larger
model. We also compare API prices between DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct, GPT-4o, and Claude
Sonnet 3.5 in the context of solving SWE-bench Lite issues. When keeping the agent framework
(Moatless Tools [ 67]) constant, sampling five times from the weaker and cheaper DeepSeek model
solves more issues than single samples from Claude or GPT while also being over 3x cheaper.
Finally, we demonstrate that scalable verification is necessary for fully benefiting from repeated
sampling. As the number of samples increases, coverage improves through models generating correct
solutions to problems they have not previously solved. However, these increasingly rare correct
generations are only beneficial if verifiers can “find the needle in the haystack” and identify them
from collections of mostly-incorrect samples. In math word problem settings, we find that two
common methods for verification (majority voting and reward models) do not possess this ability.
When solving MATH [ 26] problems with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, coverage increases from 82.9% with
100 samples to 98.44% with 10,000 samples. However, when using majority voting or reward models
to select final answers, the biggest performance increase is only from 40.50% to 41.41% over the
same sample range. As the number of samples increases, the gap between coverage (i.e. performance
with a perfect verifier) and the performance of these methods increases as well (Figure 7).
In summary, our primary observations are:
1.We demonstrate that scaling inference compute through repeated sampling leads to large
improvements in coverage across a variety of tasks and models. This makes it possible, and
sometimes cost-effective, to amplify weaker models with many samples and outperform single
samples from more capable models.
2.We show that the relationship between coverage and the number of samples can often be
modelled using an exponentiated power law, suggesting a form of scaling laws for inference-time
compute.
3.In domains without automatic verifiers, we show that common approaches to verification
plateau beyond approximately 100 samples. This leads to a growing gap between the perfor-
mance achieved with these methods and the coverage upper bound.
2 Scaling Repeated Sampling
We focus on pass-fail tasks where a candidate solution can be scored as right or wrong. The primary
metric of interest for these tasks is the success rate: the fraction of problems that we are able to
solve. With repeated sampling, we consider a setup where a model can generate many candidate
solutions while attempting to solve a problem. The success rate is therefore influenced both by
the ability to generate correct samples for many problems (i.e. coverage), as well as the ability to
identify these correct samples (i.e. precision).
The difficulty of the precision problem depends on the availability of tools for sample verification.
When proving formal statements in Lean, proof checkers can quickly identify whether a candidate
solution is correct. Similarly, unit tests can be used to verify candidate solutions to coding tasks.
In these cases, precision is handled automatically, and improving coverage directly translates into
higher success rates. In contrast, the tools available for verifying solutions to math word problems
from GSM8K and MATH are limited, necessitating additional verification methods that decide on a
single final answer from many (often conflicting) samples.
We consider the following five tasks:
3
1.GSM8K: A dataset of grade-school level math word problems [ 18]. We evaluate on a random
subset of 128 problems from the GSM8K test set.
2.MATH: Another dataset of math word problems that are generally harder than those from
GSM8K [13]. Similarly, we evaluate on 128 random problems from this dataset’s test set.
3.MiniF2F-MATH: A dataset of mathematics problems that have been formalized into proof
checking languages [ 65]. We use Lean4 as our language, and evaluate on the 130 test set
problems that are formalized from the MATH dataset.
4.CodeContests: A dataset of competitive programming problems [ 41]. Each problem has a
text description, along with a set of input-output test cases (hidden from the model) that can
be used to verify the correctness of a candidate solution. We enforce that models write their
solutions using Python3.
5.SWE-bench Lite: A dataset of real world Github issues, where each problem consists of a
description and a snapshot of a code repository [ 32]. To solve a problem, models must edit
files in the codebase (in the Lite subset of SWE-bench that we use, only a single file needs to
be changed). Candidate solutions can be automatically checked using the repository’s suite of
unit tests.
Among these tasks, MiniF2F-MATH, CodeContests, and SWE-bench Lite have automatic
verifiers (in the form of the Lean4 proof checker, test cases, and unit test suites, respectively). We
begin by investigating how repeated sampling improves model coverage. Coverage improvements
correspond directly with increased success rates for tasks with automatic verifiers and in the general
case provide an upper bound on the success rate. In coding settings, our definition of coverage is
equivalent to the commonly-used pass@k metric [ 15], where kdenotes the number of samples per
problem. We use this metric directly when evaluating on CodeContests and SWE-bench Lite. For
MiniF2F the metric is similar, with a “pass” defined according to the Lean4 proof checker. For
GSM8K and MATH, coverage corresponds to using an oracle verifier that checks if any sample
“passes” by outputting the correct final answer. To reduce the variance when calculating coverage, we
adopt the unbiased estimation formula from Chen et al. [15]. In each experiment, we first generate
Nsamples for each problem index iand calculate the number of correct samples Ci. We then
calculate the pass@k scores at each k≤Nof interest according to:
pass@k =1
# of problems# of problemsX
i=1 
1−","The paper is about making it faster and more efficient to use large language models, which are AI systems that can generate human-like text. These models require a lot of computing power to run, which can be a barrier to using them in many real-world applications. The researchers explore different techniques to reduce the amount of computing power needed for ""inference"" - the process of generating new text using the language model. This includes methods like repeated sampling , which can produce high-quality text output without needing as much computing power. The goal is to find ways to make these powerful language models more accessible and practical to use, by making the inference process less computationally intensive. This could unlock new use cases and applications for large language models beyond just research."

Abstract
The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of infor-
mation redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency
in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to
large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to
higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scal-
ability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger
parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes
a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing
compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically
choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through
cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance
as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold .
We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K,
Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE’s adapt-
ability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different
inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.
1 Introduction
Visual tokens, the fundamental building blocks of image and video representations, often exhibit
strong inter-dependencies, spatially in images and spatio-temporally in videos. This offers a potential
avenue for optimization in visual processing, as processing every token with equal emphasis may
not be necessary for achieving optimal results. Traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) [ 18] and Video
Vision Transformer (ViViT) [ 2] based models, however, process all tokens with equal emphasis,
disregarding this inherent codependency and leading to unnecessary computational burden. This be-
comes a major bottleneck when deploying these models in real-world scenarios, where computational
resources may be limited and real-time processing is required.
To this end, conditional computation has become a promising line of research to increase the capacity
of a network, while only conditionally activating a part of it during inference. Sparse Mixture of
Experts (MoEs) was initially popularized for Natural Language Processing (NLP) [ 38,20],but it has
been gaining attention for furthering conditional computation ideas in vision [ 35,1,31,46] as well.
While MoEs bring in improved performance at a given inference cost, they also increase the overall
parameter count, leading to increased storage requirements. Moreover, these works rely on experts
that have the same parameter count and compute, limiting their ability to reduce computational costs
without resorting to skipping tokens entirely.

using the full model – to fit a compute budget – by an increasing threshold on MoNE’s router logits.
In this work, we devise the Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) framework, which provides a
scalable approach to conditional computation, bringing in significant reductions at inference time,
while working with the same parameter space as the baseline model. MoNE draws inspiration from
nested architectures [ 43,28,49], particularly MatFormer [ 17], that learns multiple representations
of the same data with varying levels of details, based on structured slices of the parameter space.
MoNE employs these structured nested models as experts in the MoE framework (without increasing
parameter count), and learns a network to route tokens to these experts. We explore various design
choices and present an effective recipe for allocating compute to experts, assigning tokens to experts,
and training the MoNE framework. For the assignment operation, we propose Expert Preferred
Routing (EPR), a routing algorithm that greedily assigns tokens to experts under capacity constraints
based on router predictions. Figure 1 shows token importance as perceived by MoNE. We propose
the following three primary contributions :
1.We introduce the novel Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) framework to dynamically allocate
computational resources for Vision Transformer (ViT) based models.
2.Given a fixed parameter count, MoNE offers the flexibility of learning networks at much lower
FLOPs (∼2.3×on video datasets), while still matching baseline performances.
3.Rigorous experiments show that MoNE works well for both image and video transformers, and
visualizations depict that tokens routed to larger experts correlate well with regions of interest.
2 Related Work
Transformers [ 41] have become the de-facto architecture for processing data across multiple modal-
ities spanning language [ 9,32], images [ 18,15], video [ 2,45] and audio [ 21] and combinations
thereof [ 34]. Consequently, there have been numerous efforts to improve the efficiency of transform-
ers to make them more amenable for deployment in real-world applications [ 40]. These include
approaches like efficient approximations of attention [ 11,44], local attention [ 29,3,12] and reducing
the number of tokens in the transformer [ 36,27,7] among others. Our work focuses on conditional
computation [ 4], observing that some input tokens are easier to process than others, and therefore
require less computation during inference.
Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) transformers learn to route tokens to one of multiple expert MLPs [ 38,20].
Although such models conditionally process input tokens, each expert has the same parameter- and
FLOP-count, meaning that the total computation is constant for each input. More relevant to our
approach, Mixture of Depths [ 33] extends the routing logic of MoE to conditionally skip an expert
completely, thus total computation for each input varies dynamically. Completely skipping tokens
being a hard unretrievable decision, our work chooses from an array of nested network, which
effectively process information and help to stabilize training by getting rid of discontinuities.
Nested architectures [ 43,28,49] on the other hand, learn hierarchical representations of the input,
where the first khidden dimensions encode the most relevant information. This allows to extract
multiple models with varying inference compute from a single trained model, similar to ‘Mix-n-Match’
in [17]. However, these models do not process tokens adaptively. Our model, in contrast, consists of a
learned router which dynamically routes tokens to experts of different hidden dimensions based on the
given compute constraints. Therefore, instead of requiring the user to select the hidden dimensions of
2
each transformer layer, our model only needs a single compute constraint input. Moreover, we show
experimentally the superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs achieved by our approach.
We note that other conditional computation approaches include “early exiting” [ 42,37,19,26] such
that the processing of “easy inputs” terminates before passing through all layers of the transformer.
In addition, the ACT [ 23] algorithm was proposed for recurrent neural networks, and uses a “ponder
cost” to learn a “halting score” for when to stop processing a particular input. This has since been
extended to recurrent transformers [ 13], and also to each individual token in a transformer [ 48,47],
thus adaptively determining which tokens in a transformer to process. In contrast, our approach
does not drop tokens, rather processes them with smaller nested models. This allows us to retain
most of the information, and hence dampen the effect of irrecoverable decisions. We experimentally
verify that our adaptive approach offers strong compute-performance trade-offs. Flextron [ 10] is a
concurrent work, which looks at elastic inference, specified by user latency needs, with a focus on
language modeling. Unlike Flextron, MoNE is guaranteed to learn models bounded by the specified
latency needs and is able to learn from a single training phase, without using a surrogate model.
3 Preliminaries
Here, we discuss the concept of nested models , on which we build Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE),
followed by a discussion about Mixture of Nested Experts (MoE), and its differences from MoNE.
3.1 Nested Models
For the purposes of this work, we use the Vision Transformer (ViT) [ 18] as an example of a full
model, from which nested submodels can be derived. Inspired by MatFormer [ 17], we define these
submodels for every layer of the network, for both Self-Attention and MLP. The key idea is that
in a feature projection operation Wx, where W=[W[∶D
m],W[D
m∶]], andW[∶D
m]denotes “slicing”
the firstD
mdimensions, we can extract a partial projection W[∶D
m]x[∶D
m]. This can be done for any
projection in the transformer, and we can extract smaller models from it. We refer to these as nested
models, and D/mas the nested model dimension. This is shown in Figure 2a. The Extract operation
extracts the first D/mfeatures and applies the corresponding projection sub-matrix to it, while the
Padoperation pads it back to full dimension Dbefore residual connections and LayerNorm. While
MatFormer applies the nested structure only to the hidden dimension of the MLP layer, in our
approach we extend it to the in- and out-projections of both the Self-Attention (SA) and MLP layer.
In the SA block, irrespective of the sub-model used in the in-projections, it is always projected to the
model dimension Dfor the(QKT)Voperation. The same thing is performed in MLP, where the
hidden dimension is always 4D, as in ViT, irrespective of the dimension of the in/out-projection.
We extract Enested models with exponentially-spaced model dimensions. Therefore, for a typical
value of E=4, the model dimension for the nested models are [D
8,D
4,D
2, D]. Note that while we
build upon the idea of nested models from MatFormer, we do not share their training strategy which
involves joint optimization through a weighted loss over these submodels. In contrast, we treat these
nested models as distinct experts with varying compute requirements. The Mixture of Nested Experts
(MoNE) framework (described in detail in Sec. 4.1) then dynamically routes input tokens to these
nested experts based on their information content, with the idea that more informative tokens should
be processed by larger (and thus more computationally expensive) nested models.
3.2 Mixture of Experts
A Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer in a transformer can be represented as MoE(x)=∑E
i=1g(x)iei(x),
where Eis the number of experts, ei()are the expert models each having their own parameters,
g∶RD→REis the routing/gating function, which decides the experts which should process x. Note
thatgis sparse with only k<<Enon-zero terms. During inference, only those experts are active.
MoE strictly increases the parameter count, but maintains the same inference FLOPs by setting k=1.
However, it still needs to process all tokens with the same pre-defined compute. In contrast, in MoNE,
we do not extend the parameter count of the model, due to the nesting structure (see Sec. 3.1), and
dynamically choose a nested expert during inference. Unlike in MoE, where all experts have the
same capacity, in MoNE, ei⊂ei+1withk=1, which allows us to dynamically allocate compute.

projected to the same dimension. The router weights are also multiplied with the features for proper flow of
gradients. A lighter color in the weight matrix indicate a sliced matrix to construct the nestedness.
4 Methodology
In this section, we describe the details of our Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) framework for
efficient inference. We assume a Vision Transformer (ViT) [ 18] based architecture for our approach,
and then extend it to Video ViT (ViViT) [2] as well.
4.1 Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE)
Tokenization: In this paper, as our primary focus is images and videos, the model input is in
RH×W×3×T, where T=1for images and T>1for videos. After tokenization, the input to the
transformer is X∈RD×Nwhere Nis the number of tokens, and Dtheir model dimension. For
images, we have N=H/ph⋅W/pw, and for video, N=T/pt⋅H/ph⋅W/pw, where H, W, T are
the input height, width and duration respectively. ph,pwandptare the patch sizes along these
respective dimensions. We use the ViT [ 18] and ViViT [ 2] architectures to tokenize images and
videos respectively, obtaining a list of tokens X={xi}N
i=1.
MoNE Block: The Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) framework is a dynamic routing mechanism
that processes visual tokens using nested models with varying computational capacities, instead
of processing all tokens with the full model. A pictorial repsentation of the model is presented
in Figure 2b. Let Bl={Bl
1, . . . ,Bl
E}denote the nested blocks at a certain layer lwith increasing
parameter sizes, Bl
E(.)being the full model block. A router network decides the appropriate nested
block to use for every token. Hence information from tokens of different model dimension interact
with each other. This is enabled by performing self-attention at the full model dimension Das
discussed before. For each token xi, a router produces a probability distribution over the Enested
experts, ri=softmax (Wrxi+br), where Wrandbrdenote the router weights and bias respectively.
These router predictions are sent to an assignment algorithm, which assigns every token to a single
appropriate nested expert. Based on the assignments, we update the features for the ithtoken in the
lthlayer as follows -
xl+1
i=zl
i+(αrl
i,j+1)⋅BFFN,l
j(zl
i) zl
i=xl
i+BSA,l
j(xl
i) (1)
4
where the jthnested expert is chosen by the Expert Preferred Router [ EPR(.)] algorithm for the ith
token as per Eq. 2:
j∗=EPR(i;{rl
i}N
i=1) (2)
Note that the multiplication of the router predictions with the model output in Eq. 1 allows gradient
propagation through the router weights. We also introduce a learnable parameter α∈[0,1), initialized
to0, which ensures proper gradient flow during the initial training stages, specifically during finetuning
from a pre-trained MatFormer model. Without scaling, a low initial router prediction would dampen
the block output, whereas the initial multiplicative factor being 1 ensures a stable starting point.
Features and Loss: The feature of the last layer xL
iis used for downstream applications. For
classification tasks, we apply global average pooling on all the token features and apply a linear
classifier layer to predict the categories.
4.2 Token to Nested Expert Assignments
Within the MoNE framework, the routing strategy is crucial for achieving an optimal balance between
performance and computational efficiency. Traditionally there are two primary routing strategies –
token choice [ 38] and expert choice [ 35] . In token-choice routing, the router predicts the probability
distribution over the available experts, and picks the expert with the highest probability. However,
this can suffer from load balancing issues, with most of the tokens being routed to one or few experts.
Hence, inference time compute is only bounded by the compute of the full model. On the other hand,
in expert choice routing, each expert selects the top- ktokens with the highest preference for that
expert. This guarantees perfect bounds on computation. Potential conflicts due to token selection by
multiple experts are resolved by prioritizing based on model size.
Formally, we consider a given distribution of nested models applied to the tokens, represented as
c={c1, . . . , c E},s.t.,∑ici=1, which we call the capacity distribution over the nested models. The
method for obtaining a suitable capacity distribution, given the inference time compute requirements,
will be discussed in Sec. 4.3. Given router probabilities riforNtokens across Eexperts, we employ
an Expert Preferred Routing algorithm (Algorithm 1). This is a greedy assignment approach that
gives higher preference to larger nested models, aiming to identify the most important tokens first. We
begin by examining the router predictions for the biggest to the smallest model, assigning kj=⌊cjN⌋
of the remaining tokens to jthnested model. Any remaining tokens, arising from integer packing
constraints, are assigned to the smallest model. Algorithm 1 presents the proposed Expert Preferred
Routing (EPR) algorithm.

4.3 Capacity Distribution Across Experts
The Expert Preferred Routing (EPR) as described in Section 4.2 needs the individual expert’s capacity
bounds cito be specified. To get this, we define a metric called the effective capacity : ec=∑E
i=1cidi/D,
where di=D/2E−iis the model dimension of the ithnested model. Given a certain inference FLOP
requirement, we can translate that to an equivalent effective capacity ec. Since every token gets
processed through exactly one nested expert, this along with the given budget imposes two constraints
on the unknown capacity distribution c. However, since the individual expert capacities vary log-
linearly, multiple distributions ccan lead to the same ecforE>2and it is non-trivial to choose
5
one over the other. MoEs generally use auxilliary loss functions [ 35,38] to promote equal usage
of experts. But in MoNE, that would render a certain fixed capacity, missing out on the flexibility
that the framework provides to function with any capacity. Hence, we invoke intuitive constraints to
solve for c. Specifically, we incentivize the usage of larger models, while also adding an entropy term
to ensure uniformity of capacities across experts. Given these constraints, we solve the following
optimization problem:
maximizeE
∑
i=1ci
δi−1−βE
∑
i=1ci⋅logci
subject toE
∑
i=1ci=1E
∑
i=1ci
2E−i=ec 0≤ci≤1∀i∈{1, ..., E }
given 0<ec<1, E, δ>1, β>0(3)
In practice, we set ( β, δ) to(10,2)and use a Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP)
optimizer to solve Eq. 3 for the capacity distribution c, which is then used by EPR (Algorithm 1) to
get token to expert mappings. We empirically verify these choices in Section 6.
4.4 Videos
MoNE can be seamlessly adapted for video-based tasks. In videos, there exists another dimension
– time – which adds to the significant redundancy in the tokens. Given the large number of tokens
that can be obtained from a video, the computational costs grow drastically. To tackle this problem,
works in literature factorize computation along space and time [ 2,5], perform local windowed
computation [30], etc. MoNE being a token based approach, directly extends to video encoders.
For video processing, we leverage the Factorized Encoder architecture of ViViT [ 2]. This architecture
employs two distinct transformers: spatial and temporal. After tokenization, each temporal index
yields a set of tokens representing information from local spatio-temporal neighborhoods. These
spatial tokens interact within their temporal index for Lslayers, culminating in a single global token
per index. Subsequently, a temporal transformer processes these global tokens across Ltlayers. Given
that the spatial transformer significantly dominates computational costs in this model, we integrate
MoNE into the spatial component while maintaining full capacity for the temporal transformer. The
router predicts expert assignments for all temporal frames independently, which are then consumed
by the EPR(.) algorithm to produce frame-wise expert assignments.
5 Results
In this section, we empirically evaluate MoNE on multiple datasets spanning images and videos, for
different sizes and assess its adaptability to stringent FLOP constraints during inference.
Implementation details: We empirically evaluate MoNE on image and video classification. For
image classification, we train the network with random initialization. As for video classification,
we follow previous literature and start from a pre-trained MatViT [ 17] model due to the inherent
nested structure required in MoNE. We follow the joint training strategy of MatViT, with separate
losses an all model granularities. We implement MoNE on JAX [ 8] using BigVision [ 6] for image
classification and Scenic [ 14] for video classification. We follow the AugReg [ 39] training strategy to
train all our image classification models. For video classification tasks, we inherit all augmentations
and hyperparameter values directly from the ViViT [2] paper.
For all experiments in this section, we place a single router at the first transformer layer, and propagate
the router decisions to all the layers. We also multiply the router predictions (Eqn 1) to all layers,
which ensures differentiable paths through the router network in all layers and allows the more
evolved features from later layers to influence router learning. We also perform analysis of router
placement in Section 6.
Baselines: We first compare with MatViT’s nested models. As mentioned in the paper [ 17], we
perform joint training over all four nested models that we consider in this work - {D
8,D
4,D
2, D}.
MatViT is equivalent to MoNE, with a deterministic router to pass all tokens to the same nested
model. We show that adaptively mixing tokens with different model dimensions performs much

better across datasets and tasks. We also compare with Mixture of Depths (MoD) [ 33], which is also
a token routing algorithm, but proposed for language tasks. MoD takes the extreme decision of either
processing or skipping for every token in a layer. MoNE, on the other hand, makes fuzzy decisions to
choose intermediate-sized models, instead of skipping, which helps to retain significant information
at the expense of low compute. We adopt the best reported MoD configuration: processing 12.5%of
tokens every other layer while processing all tokens in the remaining layers.
Images: First, we evaluate MoNE on ImageNet-21k [ 16] classification using ViT. We experiment
with S, B, and L models to showcase the efficacy of MoNE across model sizes. As ImageNet-21k can
have multiple labels for an image, we report the commonly used precision@1 metric. Figure 3 shows
the results for all the models on ImageNet-21k. MoNE performs much better than MatViT’s nested
models and MoD, specifically in the low FLOPs regimes. MoNE achieves comparable performance
to baselines with around 2×reduction in FLOPs.
Following the literature on language models [ 33,25], we experimented with isoFLOPs training,
which involves training for the same number of FLOPs as the baseline models. Since MoNE models
have fewer FLOPs compared to their ViT counterparts, they require more training epochs to achieve
the same total training FLOPs. We conducted this experiment on the S/16 model (see Figure 3a) and
observed additional improvements in MoNE’s performance, particularly for the lower FLOPs models.
Videos: Since video models rely on heavy pre-training [ 2], we first train a baseline model with nested
structure on the benchmark datasets - Kinetics-400 [ 28] and Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) [ 22].
We use the ViViT Factorized Encoder B/16 model [ 2] for our experiments and consistently report
the 8x1 test accuracy, averaging predictions over 8 temporal clips [ 2]. Figure 4 illustrates the results
of the MoNE framework, significantly outperforming the individual nested models. MoNE offers
2−3×reduction in FLOPs compared to the ViViT baseline, without any accuracy drop (On SSv2, the
FLOPs for MoNE are 162.8 vs 376.3, with similar accuracy – 64.6 vs 64.4). We always do isoFLOPs
training while fine-tuning these models. We attribute the higher compute gains compared to images
due to the greater (spatial and temporal) redundancy in videos, which MoNE exploits well.
Inference time capacity adaptation: Capacity adaptation during inference is crucial, as the inference
time budget is often dynamic, changing based on user needs. Ideally, a model should adjust with little

to no retraining. To evaluate this ability, we test how MoNE, trained at a specific effective capacity
(ec) performs when evaluated at other capacities. Fig. 5 presents the results for image and video
classification. We observe that the model adapts well to nearby capacities. However, as expected, its
ability declines with extreme shifts in the capacity budget between train and eval. The performance
degradation is steeper while adapting a model trained at high capacity to low capacity. We also note
that the performance degrades more gracefully in videos than on images, presumably due to the larger
temporal redundancy.
To enhance model adaptability, we train a model with the capacity sampled uniformly at random
from{0.15,0.25, . . . ,0.95}at each training step. The results on SS-v2 (Figure 5b) demonstrate
our framework’s strong capability to adapt to any inference-time budget using a single model. It is
interesting to note that the training FLOPs of this adaptively trained model are equal to those of a
baseline model (isoFLOPs training). The model adapts extremely well even to capacities that are
significantly different ( {0.2,0.3, . . .}) from those sampled during training.
6 Router Analysis
In this section, we discuss, analyse and visualise the design choices in implementing the router
network. We choose the SSv2 dataset for this analysis.
Router Position: As discussed before, we use a single router at the first layer, and propagate
its decisions for all layers. While a delayed router might benefit from a more processed feature
representation as input, this also diminishes the compute gains, as the initial layers operate at full
capacity. We reason this choice by monitoring performance while placing the router at different
layers in the network. As Figure 6a suggests, the gains through richer features from the later layers is
outweighed by the shift in the curve to the right, and an equivalent capacity with our default router
produces higher points on the curve.
Number of Routers: We vary the number of routers, placing them at different regular intervals in
the network in Figure 6b. The decision from one router is carried out until the next router block
is encountered. We notice a clear downtrend in performance as we increase the number of routers
from being present in the first layer to being present in all layers. Intuitively, more routers demands
learning more decisions, and the main network in turn has to adapt to these decisions making it harder
to optimize.

Traditional transformer models process all the visual information in the same way, but MoNE allows the model to adaptively route different parts of the visual input to specialized ""expert"" sub-models that are better suited to handle those particular elements. For example, when looking at an image, some parts might contain text, while others have objects or animals. MoNE can send the text-containing regions to an expert sub-model that is good at processing text, while routing the object-containing regions to a different expert that specializes in object recognition. This allows the overall model to be more efficient and accurate, as each part of the input is being processed by the most appropriate sub-model. The key innovation in MoNE is this dynamic routing mechanism that decides which expert sub-model should handle each part of the visual input. This enables the model to adapt its processing to the specific characteristics of the input, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. The researchers show that this leads to improved performance on a variety of computer vision tasks compared to standard transformer models."

Abstract
Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive
LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-
modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation
to visual generation is discretization—representing continuous data like images
and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos
include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector
quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose
to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via
canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, A VC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture
without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to
generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly
outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and A VC formats. Evaluation of image
generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective
than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on
which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-
LMhas an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-
tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations
can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation,
facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.
1 Introduction
With large language models (LLMs) the field of NLP has shifted to multi-task processing (e.g.,
machine translation, code generation, action planning) using a single LLM with little data needed
for adaptation (Ouyang et al., 2022). We envision that future research will continue shifting to
multi-modal multi-task processing, where text and visual data are mixed. However, current paradigms
of generating images and videos differ substantially from text generation, requiring specialized and
complicated training and representations (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles
and Xie, 2023). In this work, we simplify the task of image and video generation by using the exact
autoregressive transformer architecture as in mainstream LLMs (Radford et al., 2019), over canonical
and universal codecs: JPEG for images (Wallace, 1991), and A VC/H.264 for videos (Wiegand et al.,
2003).
The key obstacle to training autoregressive models for image and video generation is discretization , as
continuous data like images and videos need to be represented as discrete tokens. Current generative
vision models that follow autoregressive language modeling objectives (Bengio et al., 2000) often
adopt vector quantization (VQ) to encode images or videos to some learned latent codes and then
apply language models (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021; Yan et al.,
Preprint. Under review.arXiv:2408.08459v2 [cs.CL] 21 Aug 2024
2021; Yu et al., 2023).1However, VQ methods often demand sophisticated tokenizer training that
requires a careful hyperparameter selection for vision-specific modules (e.g., downsampling factor
in convolutions) and balancing across several losses (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Esser et al., 2021).
VQ also involves a two-stage, non-end-to-end learning process (first the neural tokenizer, then the
latent code LM). This makes downstream adaptation of the models less flexible (e.g., tuning the
VQ tokenizer interferes with the learned latent code LM). Overall, the use of conventional LLM
architectures (end-to-end autoregressive sequence modeling) as generative vision models is not yet
straightforward.
The seminal work of ImageGPT (Chen et al., 2020) attempted to bridge this gap by using a regular
GPT architecture to model pixels sequentially. They have shown a small-scale success at a very low
resolution of 32x32 pixels. More realistic images at a size of 256x256 would require modeling a
prohibitive amount of tokens in each sequence (65K or 196K tokens depending on color modes), not
to mention videos. This hinders the method’s wider adoption by the field.
In this work, we tackle the problem of training LLM architectures for image and video generation
where the essential discretization neither adds significant complications to the pipeline like VQ meth-
ods, nor is computationally prohibitively expensive like ImageGPT. Specifically, we use canonical
file encodings/codecs—JPEG for images (Wallace, 1991), and A VC/H.264 for videos (Wiegand et al.,
2003)—as non-neural preprocessors that discretize data. We show that codec-based representations
greatly mitigate the sequence length limitation while being simple and effective. This design enables
us to train a vanilla transformer with the conventional language modeling objective for image and
video generation in a realistic setup.
We pretrain two 7B models with a Llama-2 architecture (Touvron et al., 2023), named JPEG-LM and
AVC-LM , that can generate 256x256 images and 256x144 videos with 15 frames, with an average
context length of 5K and 15K, respectively. In our main image modeling/generation evaluations,
we show that JPEG-LM surpasses strong VQ-based models in generation quality (an average of
31% FID reduction) and produces surprisingly realistic qualitative examples. Our results also show
AVC-LM can generate videos with realistic movements. Furthermore, we analyze in which aspects
JPEG-LM is particularly stronger than VQ models and discover that our non-neural, training-free
codec representations are more competent in capturing long-tail elements in images (e.g., human
faces/eyes and text characters in small sizes).
Overall, this work presents how conventional LLM architectures can be used as generalized models
towards visual generation. Our approach using canonical codecs does not incur vision-specific com-
plications in the pipeline or suffer from sequence length infeasibility seen in prior work. Compared
to the baselines, our models are much simpler to train and more effective. Following the previous
efforts in unifying detached language-based tasks, our method helps pave the way to a unification of
multiple modalities, facilitating the exploration of porting LLM techniques (e.g., alignment, scaling,
efficiency, security, etc.) to all modalities.
2 Background
In this work, we explore autoregressive image generation as a straightforward extension of prominent
LLM setups (Radford et al., 2019).2Conventional language modeling (Bengio et al., 2000) models
the likelihood of sequential data autoregressively. Specifically, given a sequence of discrete tokens
x1, x2,···, xN(orx1:N), a language model models p(x1:N) =QN
i=1p(xi|x1:i−1), an objective
used in most mainstream LLMs. The key of applying language modeling to visual generation is
how to discretize continuous data xlike images and videos to discrete tokens x1:Nlike in language.
Below we give an overview of two prominent approaches to the discretization of images.
1The other major line of generative vision models are diffusion models, a score-based, non-autoregressive
method (Song and Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles and Xie, 2023). Since the
diffusion objectives are drastically different from the language modeling objective, it is challenging to integrate
them in a multi-modal setup (e.g., with regular language models). While not a main focus of this work, we
include comparisons with diffusion models in our later experiments as a secondary evaluation.
2As a proof of concept, we mainly explore autoregressive modeling in visual generation only (images and
videos, without text-conditioning), while future work may explore more diverse multi-modal setups.

2.1 Pixel values: ImageGPT
ImageGPT (Chen et al., 2020) is an image generation model based on a conventional LLM architecture
(GPT-2). The images are discretized as a sequence of pixel values (integers 0–255) from the upper-left
to the bottom-right pixel (raster scan). Since there are three channels of colors for each pixel, to
reduce the number of tokens in each pixel sequence, ImageGPT clusters pixel colors to 512 distinctive
clusters (i.e., for each pixel, three values from 0 to 255 are converted to one value from 0 to 511).
ImageGPT models the probability of pixel sequences autoregressively: p(pixel-value( x)i|
pixel-value( x)1:i−1). This is an expensive process, and ImageGPT only models and generates
32x32 images. Images with a more realistic resolution like 256x256 would require 65K tokens for
each image (or 196K tokens without color clustering), a prohibitive sequence length for LLMs.
2.2 Latent codes: Vector-Quantization models
Vector-quantization (VQ) operates as a two-stage process, tokenizer training and language model
training (Esser et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2021). We take VQ-V AE as our example tokenizer
which discretizes continuous images (Van Den Oord et al., 2017). The tokenizer first learns an
encoder Eto project an image xto spatial features E(x). Then for each feature einE(x), it is
quantized to ˆzby looking up the nearest neighbor in a learned codebook Z:ˆz= quantize( E(x)) =
[argminzk∈Z∥e−zk∥2
2]e∈E(x). The index kof the nearest entry in codebook Zfor each spatial
feature forms the sequence of VQ latent codes. A decoder Gis then learned to reconstruct the original
image from the quantized representations. Overall, VQ-V AE learns an encoder E, decoder G, and
codebook Z, with three distinct losses: reconstruction loss, codebook loss, and commitment loss.
LVQ-V AE =∥x−G(ˆz)∥1+∥sg[E(x)]−ˆz∥2
2+β∥sg[ˆz]−E(x)∥2
2. An effective VQ tokenizer
needs a large amount of training data, proper hyperparameters for the vision-specific modules (e.g.,
downsampling factor in convolutional encoder E(·)), and a careful balance between the different
losses (e.g., in LVQ-V AE ), which add significant complications to the pipeline.
A language model architecture can then be trained over the VQ latent codes (a sequence of index
kabove) as a generative vision model: p(VQ-code( x)i|VQ-code( x)1:i−1). Notably, since the
training of language model comes after and depends on the VQ tokenizer, a post-hoc update to the
VQ tokenizer is challenging since it would lead to a non-trivial retraining or adaptation of the trained
language model. Indeed in §5.3 we find that the VQ tokenizer, though trained with a large amount of
data, still struggles with long-tail elements in the images and is hard to be optimized once and for all.
For simplicity and end-to-end adaptability, we propose to discretize continuous image and video data
via canonical codecs.
3 J PEG-LM and A VC-LM
Though images and videos are continuous data and naturally have 2D or 3D data structures, they
are stored as files on computers efficiently via compression/codecs, which leads to a discrete 1D
representation. We aim to explore whether standard LLM architectures can directly learn to model
and generate canonical vision file encodings, which can subsequently be read/opened as generated
images or videos. Generation in this paradigm would greatly mitigate the sequence length infeasibility
in ImageGPT while being simple and end-to-end trainable compared to VQ methods. Moreover,
canonical file encodings/codecs are often non-neural and training-free and are robust to distributional
shifts (§5.3). In this work, we choose the most popular and established file encodings/codecs for
images and videos, JPEG (Wallace, 1991) and A VC/H.264 (Wiegand et al., 2003), respectively.3
3.1 Canonical codecs: JPEG and A VC/H.264
Canonical non-neural codecs like JPEG and A VC have a high-level intuition to compress signals that
are less perceptible to human eyes more aggressively. JPEG has three main steps to encode each
image: discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, and entropy coding. DCT converts each image
patch to a weighted combination of a preset of patches containing low- and high-frequency patterns.
3For images, PNG is also a common format. However, unlike the lossy JPEG, PNG is a lossless compression
method (similar to ZIP) and often results in less effective compression and much longer sequences than JPEG.
3
Quantization zeroes out some high-frequency patterns from the weighted combination, since human
eye is not good at perceiving them. Entropy encoding such as Huffman coding is then used to reduce
the total numbers/bits representing the patches/images.4
Figure 1: JPEG-LM andAVC-LM
are simple autoregressive trans-
formers that directly model and
generate canonical file encodings.A VC (H.264) operates on patches (macroblocks) of video frames.
Each patch can be encoded using blocks of pixels that are al-
ready encoded within the current frame (intra-frame prediction)
or using blocks of pixels encoded in other frames (inter-frame
prediction with motion estimation). The prediction is then sub-
tracted from the current patch to form a residual. The residual
then goes through a process similar to JPEG, involving DCT,
quantization, and bitstream encoding. The encoded content is
a crucial part to the subsequent container files like MP4.
Both codecs have been used widely for decades and substantially
compress the data (and thus sequence length) compared to raw
pixel modeling (in our setup 40x in JPEG and 110x in A VC).
Our focus is to use these canonical codecs as off-the-shelf tools
to convert images and videos to sequences of discrete bytes effi-
ciently.5We wish to fit an LLM to implicitly learn the grammars
and semantics of the canonical codecs.
3.2 J PEG-LM and A VC-LM
JPEG and A VC convert images and videos to bytes. Most of
these bytes represent the image and video content after entropy
encoding. However, there are also metadata and special patch/-
macroblock separators that are invariant across images or videos and use up multiple bytes. To address
them along with other unknown frequent byte combinations that are compressed suboptimally by
entropy encoding (e.g., by JPEG’s standard, fixed Huffman tables), we further extend the default byte
vocabulary (256 discrete values) slightly with byte-pair encoding (BPE), a standard preprocessing
scheme in LLMs, which merges bytes appearing together frequently to a new single token.6Since
JPEG and A VC produce sequences of variable lengths based on the content of images and videos,
special beginning-of-sequence and end-of-sequence tokens are also added to the vocabulary. The
entries in the vocabularies are considered as our JPEG/A VC tokens.
Given an image x, we propose JPEG-LM to model p(JPEG-token( x)i|JPEG-token( x)1:i−1).
Given a video x, we propose AVC-LM to model p(AVC-token( x)i|AVC-token( x)1:i−1). We use
conventional LLM architectures (autoregressive transformers) without any vision-specific modifica-
tions (no convolutions, no 2D positional embeddings) to maximize the models’ generality.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 J PEG-LM
We pretrain a 7B Llama-2 model (Touvron et al., 2023) from scratch using 23M 256x256 images.
JPEG encodes each image with a quality factor of 25 (qualitative illustration in §5.3).7We first use
10K images to derive 320 BPE tokens as our vocabulary entries. On average, each image in our
training data leads to 5K tokens. For batching efficiency, we concatenate all sequences in the dataset
and chunk in sequences of length 12K. In total, we have 9.5M sequences and thus 114B JPEG tokens
4A further intuitive and interactive description can be found at https://parametric .press/issue-01/
unraveling-the-jpeg/ (Shehata and Conlen, 2019).
5Both codecs operate at bits level at the core (due to entropy encoding), but modeling at bytes level is
effective according to our experiments.
6More precisely, for the metadata/headers in the byte sequence that are well-known to be redundant across
examples (e.g., JPEG quantization and Huffman tables), we remove them in the preprocessing and later add
them back to the generated bytes from the model. For more complicated codecs like A VC, we let BPE handle
such metadata.

three random samples from JPEG-LM and one from VQ transformer and ImageGPT (with super-

texts in image forms, etc. Additionally, JPEG-LM shows an especial advantage over baselines on
meaningful details like human eyes. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show more examples of JPEG-LM and
VQ transformer on unconditional generation.
(for each epoch). The model is trained approximately for two epochs with a maximum learning rate
of 3e-4.
4.2 A VC-LM
As a proof of concept that canonical video codecs can be used for video generation as well, similar to
JPEG-LM , a 7B Llama-2 model is pretrained from scratch as AVC-LM using 2M 256x144 videos
subsampled from Bain et al. (2021). Due to the scope of experiments, we only keep the first 5 seconds
of each video with 3 frame-per-second (thus 15 frames in total). The video is then processed with
A VC/H.264 codec with a constant quantization parameter 37.8We use 10K videos to derive 1024
BPE tokens as the vocabulary entries. On average, each video in our training data has 15K tokens.
We perform data concatenation and chunk in context lengths of 32K for efficient batching. In total,
we have 1.3M sequences and thus 42B A VC tokens.
4.3 Image generation baselines
VQ transformer We use a pretrained VQ tokenizer from Tang et al. (2022), which used 200M
images (ITHQ-200M, closed source dataset) to train a VQ-V AE model. This VQ tokenizer processes
each image in the 23M image training set for our JPEG-LM (vocabulary size 4096, sequence length
1024). We then train a 7B Llama-2 transformer with the same configuration as in JPEG-LM . We use
this VQ model as a main comparison to our J PEG-LM throughout this work.
ImageGPT + super-resolution ImageGPT uses GPT-2 XL as its underlying architecture. The
pretrained model in (Chen et al., 2020) is trained over 14M 32x32 images from ImageNet. For a
comparable evaluation, we use a super-resolution model (Rombach et al., 2022) over ImageGPT’s
output.9
8https://ffmpeg .org/
9The pretrained model provides 4x super-resolution. In our pilot study, we find performing a 4x super-
resolution, followed by a 0.5x downsample, then another 4x super-resolution yields the best result for the
322-to-2562conversion.
5
Diffusion Though not a focus of this work, we include two variants of diffusion models in the
baselines, Stable Diffusion (inpainting optimized) (Rombach et al., 2022) and VQ diffusion (Gu
et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022). Both diffusion models can take partial images (through masking)
and generate completed images, a setup we use across models in later evaluations. These baseline
diffusion models are smaller in model size (~1B) but consume orders of magnitude more training data
(200M–5B). They only serve as a secondary reference, and our focus is on comparing autoregressive
image generation models under mainstream LLM paradigms.

modeling, a fundamen-
tal evaluation is to col-
lect a set of valida-
tion data, use the pre-
fixes of data as prompts
to the pretrained lan-
guage model, and sam-
ple from the language
model for a comple-
tion (Holtzman et al.,
2020; Meister et al.,
2023). The comple-
tions are then evaluated
for their quality against
the gold validation data
through distance met-
rics like Mauve score
(Pillutla et al., 2021).
In this work, since
we focus on vision-
modality-only models
with LLM architectures,
we retain partial im-
ages (and later partial
videos) as prompts to
our models and eval-
uate their completions.
Given a prompt ratio
rprompt , the autoregres-
sive image generation
models condition on discretization( x)1:(rprompt×Ntokens)for the generation.10Throughout the eval-
uations, the comparison between JPEG-LM and VQ transformer would be the most direct, as they
share the same paradigm, model size, and training data (except that VQ transformer uses substantially
more data in the tokenizer training stage).
5.1 Qualitative analysis
In Figure 2, we show the generation samples from JPEG-LM along with baseline models over
independently sourced data outside existing training sets. We observe that by directly outputting
JPEG file bytes, JPEG-LM can generate surprisingly realistic facial expressions (especially the eyes,
compared to the strong VQ transformer), landscape, common objects, texts in image forms, etc.
10More specifically, the fixed-length VQ transformer and ImageGPT condition on
discretization( x)1:(rprompt×Ntokens)and generate discretization( x)(rprompt×Ntokens):Ntokens. Variable-length
JPEG-LM conditions on discretization( x)1:patch-position( rprompt×Npatches )and generates until a EOS token is pro-
duced. Throughout the work, sampling from autoregressive transformers is by default with top-p={0.9,1.0}
and top- k={40,80}.

Figure 3: Compression effect of VQ and JPEG
(zoom in for the best view). JPEG is significantly
better in detailed but highly perceptible elements
like small human faces and text characters. VQ

preservation.
Figure 4: Correlation between per-class
(ImageNet-1K) FID difference and class fre-
quency. The class frequency is estimated through
querying Google image search. Each class has a
corresponding data point while an aggregation is
performed for visual clarity. The correlation is
positive and statistically significant ( p=0.0002).
This indicates J PEG-LM has more advantage in
long-tail classes.In Table 1, we show prompting JPEG-LM , VQ
transformer, and other baselines with different
levels of partial images in ImageNet-1K (Rus-
sakovsky et al., 2015). The FID evaluation (Heusel
et al., 2017) contains 5000 randomly sampled im-
ages from ImageNet-1K’s validation set. This is
zero-shot generation (w.r.t. models’ training sets)
and without class-conditioning. Experiments were
done three times with different seeds. JPEG-LM
consistently outperforms the VQ transformer in
all prompting ratios. It mostly surpasses diffusion
baselines with inpainting capabilities as well.
In Table 2, we show prompting the models with
partial images in FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019). This
is also a zero-shot setup without training to the
FFHQ distribution and is evaluated on 1000 ran-
domly sampled FFHQ images. JPEG-LM consis-
tently outperforms the VQ transformer and other
baselines.
In Table 3, we further validate our findings on
fully unconditional generation with JPEG-LM and
VQ transformer. Since they were trained on the
same training data, we can compare their FID of
unconditional generation w.r.t. our held-out, i.i.d.
evaluation set. We again observe that JPEG-LM
achieves a better FID.
These findings show JPEG-LM ’s overall compe-
tence as a image generation model with a pure
LLM architecture modeling canonical file encod-
ings.
5.3 Why J PEG-LM?
A case study over long-tail elements in images
To further explore in which aspects our JPEG-LM
excels compared to the baselines, especially the
VQ transformer, we first compare how data is pro-
cessed/compressed before being trained in trans-
formers in J PEG-LM and VQ models.
JPEG vs. VQ compression JPEG-LM and VQ transformers can both be interpreted as first
performing compression and then autoregressive modeling. The VQ model, unlike the non-neural
JPEG compression, trained its VQ-V AE quantizer with a large amount of data (200M images in
our case). In Figure 3, we observe that both compression methods are relatively successful in
compressing and decompressing general scenes like nature/landscape backgrounds. However, we
find VQ suffers in small but highly perceptible elements in the images, like human faces or eyes. For
images that contain small text characters, we observe the image degradation in VQ also happens in a
non-predictable way, generating seemingly clear but uninterpretable text characters. On the other
hand, the image degradation due to the non-neural, training-free JPEG compression happens in a
predictable manner, arguably more preferrable, especially when images contain long-tail elements
with important meanings.

Table 4: Zero-shot, partial-image-conditioned, FID evalu-
ation on downscaled FFHQ (for both FID and ∆, lower

VQ transformer shows JPEG-LM is more robust to small
but meaningful long-tail elements.

∆downscaled −original −0.35 −0.90Quantitative analyses on long-tail ele-
ments In Figure 4, we first show the
per-class FID in our ImageNet-1K gen-
eration experiments. For each class of
images, we calculate the difference be-
tween their FID with JPEG-LM genera-
tions and FID with the VQ transformer
generations. We also estimate the fre-
quency/coverage of each class of images
on the internet by querying Google im-
age search and logging the total number
of returned results. We observe a statisti-
cally significant correlation between the
per-class FID difference and the class fre-
quency. The more advantage we observe
inJPEG-LM over the VQ model, the less
frequent the corresponding class is. In
other words, JPEG-LM excels relatively
more in long-tail sub-distributions.
In Table 4, we further intervene on the
FFHQ images by downsizing them (to 0.5x, while padding the images with black background to
keep the overall size), aiming to test different models’ performance on smaller visual concepts (e.g.,
small human faces). Such concepts, though small in size, can still be highly perceptible by humans
and contain important meanings. We thus want the models to be robust on them. We perform similar
prompted image generations with JPEG-LM , VQ transformer, and other baseline models.11We
find that JPEG-LM still consistently outperforms the VQ transformer (and other baselines as well).
Especially, JPEG-LM achieves slightly better performance while VQ transformer becomes worse
compared to the experiments with original image size. These deltas in opposite directions highlights
the robustness of J PEG-LM.
These findings show that JPEG-LM not only has a promising performance overall, but specially
strong with long-tail visual elements in the images.
5.4 Proof-of-concept video generation
One advantage of using canonical file encodings in LLM paradigms for vision generation is simplicity.
From JPEG-LM that generates images, we naturally take one step further and train a video generation
model, AVC-LM , that models canonical video codecs (A VC/H.264) with autoregressive transformers.
11The FID is measured on the active proportion of the images, excluding the black paddings.
8
As a proof of concept, we prompt AVC-LM with partial videos (i.e., frames) from a held-out set
from our training data and investigate the model completions. In Figure 5 (along with §C), we show
qualitative examples generated by AVC-LM . We observe that AVC-LM can capture the motion of
moving objects reasonably.
6 Related Work
Current image and video generation models often adopt an autoregressive or diffusion approach. The
autoregressive approach can build upon pixel-based representations as explored in Van Den Oord
et al. (2016); Van den Oord et al. (2016); Chen et al. (2020). These methods suffer from prohibitively
long sequences and only operate on low-resolution images. The autoregre","JPEG-LM: LLMs as Image Generators with Canonical Codec Representations introduces a new approach to image generation using large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, image generation has been done using specialized models like GANs or diffusion models. However, this paper shows that LLMs can be effective at generating high-quality images as well. The key idea is to leverage the powerful language understanding capabilities of LLMs and apply them to the task of image generation. The model is trained to generate JPEG-encoded images directly from text prompts. By using a standardized image format like JPEG, the model can learn a ""visual language"" that allows it to generate coherent and realistic images. One of the main advantages of this approach is that LLMs are highly scalable and can be trained on vast amounts of data. This allows JPEG-LM to learn a rich, visually-grounded understanding of the world, which translates to its ability to generate diverse and compelling images."

steps than the A∗implementation that was used for training initially. In our training method, A∗’s
search dynamics are expressed as a token sequence outlining when task states are added and removed
into the search tree during symbolic planning. Searchformer significantly outperforms baselines that
predict the optimal plan directly with a 5–10 ×smaller model size and a 10 ×smaller training dataset.
Lastly, we demonstrate how Searchformer scales to larger and more complex decision making tasks
with improved percentage of solved tasks and shortened search dynamics.

1 Introduction
Transformer-based architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) have demonstrated impressive performance in different
tasks, including holding conversations at the human level (Shuster et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Touvron
et al., 2023), high-quality image understanding (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2024; Assran et al., 2023)
and video generation (Singer et al., 2023), multi-modal generation (Girdhar et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021),
and code completion (Roziere et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2021). By training these architectures on internet-scale
datasets, the resulting models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can generalize well in real-world use
cases.
Despite these successes, Transformer-based architectures and LLMs still struggle when it comes to solving
planning and reasoning tasks. Previous studies demonstrate that LLMs fall short in multi-step planning
tasks (Valmeekam et al., 2023a,b) or when performing higher-order reasoning (Momennejad et al., 2023; Fan
et al., 2020).
In recent years, various methods have been proposed to improve the performance of Transformers in these
settings. One approach is to simulate the human thinking process and produce intermediate “thoughts” before
outputting a response. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and the Tree-of-thoughts (ToT)
method (Yao et al., 2023) encourage the model to “think” step by step. While these techniques are often
effective, they can also lead to worse performance, for example due to self-enforcing (Huang et al., 2023).
Furthermore, techniques effective on one dataset may not work well on others due to changes in the type of
reasoning involved (e.g., spatial reasoning vs. mathematical reasoning). How to enable Transformers and
LLMs to plan, solve multi-step decision making tasks, and perform reasoning still remains elusive and an
active area of research.

Our work
We demonstrate how to train Transformers to robustly solve complex planning tasks. Similar to LLMs, we train
Transformers to predict the next word given a sequence of words. Our experiments use synthetically generated
datasets with a synthetic language and vocabulary. Using this framework, we demonstrate how to construct
training data such that the resulting model imitates the computation performed by A∗search (Russell &
Norvig, 2021, Chapter 3). Lastly, we present Searchformer , a Transformer model that solves complex planning
tasks in fewer search steps than our A∗reference implementation. This model is obtained through search
dynamics bootstrapping , a method that first trains a Transformer to imitate A∗’s search process and then
fine-tunes the model to find an optimal plan within fewer search steps.
To train a Transformer to perform planning, we express a planning task and its optimal solution plan as
a sequence of words, called tokens. We also log the computation performed by A∗into an execution trace
consisting of a token sequence, resulting in a sequence dataset that captures A∗’ssearch dynamics . Using
these search-augmented sequences, a Transformer model is trained to generate token sequences that encode
A∗’s search dynamics along with an optimal plan.
Subsequently, the resulting search-augmented model is fine-tuned to generate shorter token sequences while
still outputting an optimal plan. We refer to this final fine-tuned model as a Searchformer. When solving
Sokoban puzzles, our models solve 93.7% of all test tasks while performing on average 26.8% fewer search
steps than our A∗reference implementation.
Through a sequence of experiments that control task complexity, dataset size, and model size, we demonstrate
that including execution traces into the training data increases performance on an independent test task
set—despite a 10×to100×increase in the length of the generated sequences. We find that search-augmented
models (that include execution traces into their training data) generate an optimal plan more often on unseen
tasks with ten times fewer training sequences than a larger solution-only model (that is trained on sequences
only including a task description and task solution). This result highlights the power of including A∗’s search
dynamics into the training process of Transformer models.
2 Related Work
While existing work (Trinh et al., 2024; Ruoss et al., 2024) leverages synthetic datasets to learn policies
for reasoning, our study is fundamentally different in this regard. We focus on improving the reasoning
capability embedded in a Transformer’s weights. Existing algorithms such as AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2018),
MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), and AlphaGeometry (Trinh et al., 2024) optimize a neural network
using the output of existing symbolic planning algorithms, whose internal states are not used (i.e., treated
as black-boxes). For example, Silver et al. (2017) use MCTS as a policy improvement operator to update
the neural network’s weights. In contrast, the presented search dynamics bootstrapping method uses a
Transformer model to generalize towards more efficient search patterns and improves the model itself. A
planning algorithm (together with its internal search dynamics) is used to initially train a Transformer model.
Prior work focuses on training a neural network on execution traces of reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021) or
on training a neural network to predict an optimal action (Yang et al., 2022; Pallagani et al., 2022; Ruoss
et al., 2024). In contrast, we focus on training a Transformer to generate the entire search process of A∗when
computing an optimal plan. Instead of only predicting a single action, our model predicts an entire multi-step
plan to solve a task.
Our work bears some similarity with neuro-symbolic systems (Graves et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2017), which build
differentiable architectures to mimic the functionality of existing symbolic systems. However, these methods
use dedicated components (e.g., explicit memory components, built-in recursion), while Searchformer focuses
on next-token prediction. Here, Searchformer relies on generating long contexts and position embeddings (Chen
et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023) to predict in optimal plan. Ultimately, our work sheds light on how to build
more general architectures that automatically learn a planning mechanism.
Using Transformer architectures to solve complex sequential decision making tasks has been studied in prior
work in a reinforcement learning (RL) setting (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021; Laskin et al., 2023).

& Norvig (2021, Chapter 3).
However, this prior work presents different methods to modelling trajectories of trial and error interactions and
focuses on predicting a next action, state, or rewards or a combination of them. In contrast, we demonstrate
how to use a Transformer to model the search steps involved in computing an optimal multi-step plan.
MCTSNet (Guez et al., 2018) also attempts to learn the search procedure itself, but still hard-codes the
MCTS search procedure (Coulom, 2006) into a neural network, which leads to quadratic backpropagation
overhead and can only deal with up to 500 step rollouts, while our approach can deal with much longer search
execution trace. We demonstrate that Transformers can not only imitate a symbolic planning algorithm but
can also be used to discover more efficient heuristics via fine-tuning.
3 Problem Setup
Figure 1 provides an overview of our synthetic dataset generation process. We consider two domains: maze
navigation (Figure 1(a)) and solving Sokoban puzzles (Figure 5 in Appendix C). In maze navigation, the goal
is to find the shortest path through an n-by-nmaze. In Sokoban, a worker can move up, down, left, or right
and has to push each box onto a dock to solve the puzzle. An incorrect move may immediately lead to a
dead end and thus reasoning across multiple time steps is required to solve the puzzle. Each state in a puzzle
consists of a combination of box and worker positions, making Sokoban computationally more difficult to
solve than maze navigation.
3.1 Generating execution traces of A∗search.
TheA∗algorithm computes an optimal plan by manipulating two sets of nodes:
•A frontier set containing the current search frontiers.
3
•A closed set containing all searched nodes.
In the maze example in Figure 1(a), each node corresponds to an empty (non-wall) grid cell. For each node,
the algorithm computes a heuristic value and a cost from start value. At any given iteration, which node is
searched next is determined by the content of the frontier and closed sets as well as the heuristic and cost
from start values (Figure 1(c), left panel). A∗’s execution trace is collected by tracking all insertion operations
into the frontier and closed set along with heuristic and cost from start values (Figure 1(c), right panel). The
right panel in Figure 1(c) illustrates the resulting trace for the maze example shown in Figure 1(b). Each row
corresponds either to an insertion of a node into the frontier, indicated by a createtoken, or to moving a node
into the closed set, indicated by a closetoken. Each node is represented by its (x, y)position in the maze
as well as the two cost tokens. The resulting plan is then appended to this trace. This trace is constructed
such that given any prefix the next token can be predicted correctly. For the maze datasets, A∗uses the
Manhattan distance to the goal location as a heuristic. In Sokoban, A∗first matches every box to the closest
dock and then computes the sum of all Manhattan distances between each box and dock pair.
For each experiment, we generate two token sequence variants, as illustrated in Figure 1:
•Solution-only sequences of the format <prompt><plan> , where the <prompt> part encodes a task
description and the <plan> part the optimal plan (Figure 1(b)).
•Search-augmented sequences of the format <prompt><trace><plan> , where the <trace> part encodes
A∗’s execution trace (Figure 1(c)).
Because every model is trained from scratch, the resulting models are specifically trained to only predict
sequences that outline optimal plans for a set of different planning tasks. After training, the model’s output is
parsed and evaluated if it contains an optimal or feasible solution plan.
3.2 Training a Transformer model
When generating a token sequence dataset, each task is unique and the test set is constructed such that it
does not contain any duplicate of the training set. With this experiment design, we hope to gain insight into
how Transformers can be used to solve planning tasks and generalize to previously unseen test tasks.
By including intermediate computation steps, the Transformer model is trained to effectively imitate the
computation performed by the A∗algorithm. Different from Procedure Cloning (Yang et al., 2022) where a
neural network is learned to predict the optimal state/action sequence (in our case task prompts and optimal
plans), our Transformer model also learns to predict the entire thinking process , including the attempted but
failed paths, that leads to the optimal plan.
For each experiment an adaptation of the encoder-decoder T5 architecture (Raffel et al., 2020) is used
that integrates Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2023). More details and hyper-parameters
can be found in Appendix B. The encoder processes the <prompt> part of a training sequence, and the
decoder processes either a <trace><plan> -formatted sequence (search-augmented model) or only a <plan>-
formatted sequence (solution-only model). Depending on the model variant, each network is trained to
maximize the cross-entropy between the distribution of the decoder generations and the distribution of
sampling a corresponding sequence from the training dataset. Appendix A describes our optimization setup
in more detail.
3.3 Moving past algorithm imitation via search dynamics bootstrapping
To reduce the number of tokens generated by a search-augmented model during inference, we implement a
method to shift the distribution with which the decoder generates execution traces. First, a search-augmented
model is trained to imitate the search dynamics of A∗search. To discover new search dynamics with this
search-augmented model and explore the execution trace space, the search-augmented model must generate
different sequences for the same task prompt. We accomplish this by inducing non-determinism into the
training data and use a non-determinsitic A∗implementation that breaks cost ties randomly and randomizes
the order with which child nodes are expanded. This approach does not decrease the efficiency of A∗search
itself and merely changes the order with which different nodes are searched while still respecting A∗’s heuristic
and cost calculations. The resulting search-augmented model will then approximate the probability distribution
with which the training sequences were generated.
4
Once a model is trained to imitate the search dynamics of non-deterministic A∗search, it is used to generate
anewtraining dataset consisting of shorter token sequences. This new dataset is constructed by using the
trained search-augmented model to sample multiple different token sequences for each training prompt. In this
step, we only use the training dataset for bootstrapping and not the test dataset. Each generated sequence is
parsed and checked if it ends in an optimal plan. If this is the case and the sequence is also shorter than the
corresponding sequence contained in the original training dataset, then this shortened sequence is included in
the new short sequence training dataset. If the generated sequence does not end in an optimal plan or is
longer than the original training sequence, then the sequence from the original training dataset is re-used.
Subsequently, the search-augmented model is fine-tuned on the new short sequence training dataset. To
distinguish from the search-augmented model that imitates A∗’s search dynamics, we call this new model
Searchformer . This procedure can then be repeated by using the resulting fine-tuned model to generate
the next even shorter sequence dataset and then fine-tuning the Searchformer model again. In Section 4.3
we demonstrate that this procedure does in fact reduce the number of steps performed during inference
while further improving performance. The Searchformer model no longer imitates A∗search and has instead
discovered a new way of solving a planning problem using fewer steps.
4 Experiments
In our experiments, we use two different A∗implementations for sequence data generation:
1.Deterministic A∗dataset: Sequences are generated by executing A∗in a deterministic fashion (by ordering
child nodes and breaking equal cost ties deterministically). Consequently, given a task prompt, the optimal
plan and A∗execution trace is unique. Here, the Transformer learns the deterministic breaking rules
implicitly encoded in the data. Evaluating such a model is simple, because the generated sequences need
to exactly match the sequences generated by A∗.
2.Non-deterministic A∗dataset: Sequences are generated by executing A∗in a non-deterministic fashion (by
randomly ordering child nodes and breaking equal cost ties randomly). Consequently, given a task prompt,
the optimal plan and A∗execution trace is no longer unique and there are multiple correct responses. Here,
the Transformer learns to generate the random tie breaking rules implicitly encoded in the sequence data.
Consequently, the generated sequences vary between different executions, but the resulting plans are still
optimal and execution traces still respect A∗’s cost and heuristic calculations as described in Section 3.3.
Figure 7 in Appendix C presents an overview of the token sequence length for each dataset and shows that
the generated A∗execution traces grow in length with task complexity. Figure 8 shows that training and test
sets are matched in difficulty and have comparable trace lengths. For each task, one model may generate a
search sequence ending either in an optimal plan, a feasible plan (a plan that is correct but sub-optimal), or
an invalid plan. In Appendix D we outline how each model’s ability to predict a feasible and optimal plan
is scored and details about how the search dynamics of the search-augmented and Searchformer models is
evaluated.
Unless indicated otherwise, each experiment is repeated five times and each figure plots averages across all
repeats. All reported errors indicate the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM).
4.1 Maze navigation
In the first experiment set, we train a set of encoder-decoder Transformer models to predict optimal plans
for maze navigation tasks. We vary the training dataset size and model size (the number of optimized
parameters) between different training runs and evaluate each model on the test tasks generated using the
same hyper-parameters.

can observe that the solution-only model is outperformed by most search-augmented models. Only for large
enough training datasets, the solution-only model matches the performance of the worst search-augmented
model. In the low training data regime (100,000 training sequences and less), performance of the solution-only
model degrades significantly, while the performance of each search-augmented model stays relatively high.
This result is surprising, because for more than 90% of the test mazes, the search-augmented models generate
<trace><plan> -formatted sequences that are thousands of tokens long without predicting any single token
incorrectly. Moreover, the solution-only models, that on average predict ten times shorter sequences, are
significantly outperformed by the search-augmented models. Even the smallest search-augmented model
significantly outperforms the much larger solution-only model parameters.
This result highlights the power of training Transformers to generate long algorithm execution traces. We do
not observe compounding prediction errors that usually limit deep model-based RL agents (Asadi et al., 2018),
because the used backward-causal decoder network constructs for an n-step sequence an n×nattention map.
Here, this property of the Transformer architecture is used to boost performance when predicting an optimal
plan.
Non-deterministic A∗
When trained on non-deterministic A∗data, the model could output multiple different optimal paths for one
task. Here, we use each model to generate 64 token sequences for each task. The test task is counted as
correctly answered of any one of the 64 sequences contains an optimal plan (please refer to the any-optimal-64
criterion in Appendix D). Because we only test if at least one generated sequence contains an optimal plan,
we obtain higher absolute numbers in Figure 2(b) than in Figure 2(a).
Figure 2(b) plots for how many test tasks an optimal plan was found when generating for each test task 64
token sequences. Here, we can observe a pattern similar to the deterministic A∗dataset: even the smallest
search-augmented models outperform solution-only model, especially for a small training set. Moreover, we
found that model size only impacts the performance of each of the search-augmented models when using very
small training datasets (50,000 training sequences). For larger training dataset sizes no significant difference
is found. Increasing the number of parameters of the solution-only models does not significantly improve their
performance in the low data regime (Figure 9 in Appendix F).
Performance across different task difficulty levels
Lastly, Figure 2(c) illustrates how a task’s difficulty influences the performance of each model. Here, we
focus again on the dataset generated by non-deterministic A∗, and consider the number of correctly solved
test tasks as a function of maze size. The larger the maze, the larger the task’s state space and the more

computation is required to find an optimal solution plan. While the solution-only model’s performance drops
rapidly as the tasks become more challenging, the search-augmented models maintain a comparably high
accuracy, even for its smallest model size. Appendix F presents a full comparison across all maze sizes.
Overall, while the solution-only models learn to predict an optimal plan if the used training dataset is large
and diverse enough, search-augmented models perform significantly better in the low data regime and scale
better to more difficult tasks. The search-augmented models reach higher performance because they can
perform on-demand computation during inference. More specifically, the search-augmented models imitate the
search dynamics for a grounded reasoning chain that leads to an optimal plan, while the solution-only models
have to infer direct correlations between a task description and its optimal plan through supervised learning
where many of such correlations can be spurious and unreliable during evaluation on the test task set.
4.2 Solving Sokoban puzzles
To test if similar results can be obtained on a different and more complex task with a different tokenization
pattern and different transition structure, we repeat our experiments for Sokoban puzzles using our non-
deterministic A∗implementation. Table 1 lists how often each model generated a correct optimal plan for
each test task. As before, by training on execution traces, the search-augmented models outperform the
solution-only models. Even increasing the parameterization of a solution-only model to 747 million parameters
only leads to a marginal performance improvement. On average, this 747 million parameter solution-only
model is still outperformed slightly by a smaller 175 million parameter search-augmented model. This
experiment further confirms our findings on more complex planning tasks with a different transition structure
and a different tokenization method.
4.3 Searchformer: Improving search dynamics via bootstrapping
In this last experiment, we investigate how the search-augmented model can be iteratively improved to
compute an optimal plan while generating a shorter execution trace. Here, our goal is to shorten the length of
the search trace while still producing an optimal solution.
We start out with the smallest search-augmented model trained on the non-deterministic A∗Sokoban dataset
and use it to generate a new shorter sequence training dataset as outlined in Section 3.3. For each Sokoban
puzzle in the training data, we generated 32 different <trace><plan> -formatted sequences by sampling
tokens from the Transformer’s output distribution and include the shortest generation (measured in tokens) if
it contains an optimal plan. Subsequently, we fine-tune the search-augmented model on this newly created
training data (by running an additional 10,000 training steps) to obtain the first Searchformer model. Using
this Searchformer model, we subsequently generate another short sequence dataset and repeat the fine-tuning
procedure to further improve the model.
Figure 3(a) illustrates how the sequence lengths generated by the Searchformer model’s are iteratively shortened
with our search dynamics boostrapping method. With every improvement step, the average length of the
generated traces—the number of search steps—decreases (Figure 3(a)). When computing an optimal plan,
the final Searchformer model generates search dynamics sequences that are on average 26.8% shorter than the

This allows the planning system to become more efficient and accurate, especially in complex environments where traditional approaches struggle.

Abstract
The feedforward (FFW) layers in standard transformer architectures incur a linear increase
in computational costs and activation memory as the hidden layer width grows. Sparse
mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this
issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-
grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. How-
ever, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational
and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert re-
trieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval
from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks
demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms
of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of
experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while main-
taining computational efficiency.

knowledge(Gevaetal.,2021;Daietal.,2022), accountfortwo-thirdsofthetotalparametersinatransformer.
However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device
memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count.
To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al.,
2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense
FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the
number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However,
their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is
reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed
number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently
outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number
of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves
performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of
model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture
of an immense number of tiny experts.
Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE
has emerged as a promising approach (Aljundi et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them
properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new
ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the
data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending (Mitchell et al., 2018), necessitating an expanding pool
of experts.
Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number
of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts
is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) (dos Santos et al., 2023). However, MoWE is language-specific
and uses a fixed routing scheme. Theoretical and empirical evidence (Clark et al., 2022; Dikkala et al., 2023)
highlights the advantages of learned routers over non-trainable ones. Thus, an MoE design with a learned
router scalable to over a million experts remains an open area for exploration.
This work introduces the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) architecture, leveraging product
key retrieval (Lample et al., 2019) for efficient routing to an extremely large number of experts, decoupling
computational cost from parameter count. This design demonstrates a superior compute-performance trade-
off in our experiments, positioning it as a competitive alternative to dense FFW layers for scaling foundation
models. The main contributions of this work are:
•Exploration of Extreme MoE Setting: Deviating from the focus on a small number of large experts
in previous MoE research, this work investigates the under-explored case of numerous tiny experts.
•LearnedIndexStructureforRouting: Demonstratingforthefirsttimethatalearnedindexstructure
(Kraska et al., 2018) can efficiently route to over a million experts.
•New Layer Design: Combining product key routing with single-neuron experts, we introduce the
PEER layer that expands layer capacity without significant computational overheads. Empirical re-
sults demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs and Product
Key Memory (PKM) layers.
•Comprehensive Ablation Studies: We investigate the impact of different design choices of PEER
such as number of experts, active parameters, number of heads and query batch normalization on
language modeling tasks.

2 Method
In this section, we introduce the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) layer, which is a Mixture
of Experts architecture using product keys (Lample et al., 2019) in the router and single-neuron MLPs as
experts. Fig. 2 illustrates the computational process within a PEER layer.
PEER Overview Formally, a PEER layer is a function f:Rn→Rmthat consists of three parts: a pool of
Nexperts E:={ei}N
i=1, where each expert ei:Rn→Rmshares the same signature as f, a corresponding
set ofNproduct keys K:={ki}N
i=1⊂Rd, and a query network q:Rn→Rdthat maps the input vector
x∈Rnto a query vector q(x). LetTkdenote the top-k operator. Given an input x, we first retrieve a subset
ofkexperts whose corresponding product keys have the highest inner products with the query q(x).
I=Tk/parenleftbig
{q(x)Tki}N
i=1/parenrightbig
# Retrieve top kexperts (1)
Then we apply nonlinear activations (such as softmax or sigmoid) to the query-key inner products of these
topkexperts to obtain the router scores.
gi(x) =s(q(x)Tki) # Compute router scores (2)
Finally, we compute the output by linearly combining the expert outputs weighted by the router scores.
f(x) =/summationdisplay
i∈Igi(x)ei(x) # Aggregate expert outputs (3)
Product Key Retrieval Since we intend to use a very large number of experts ( N≥106), naively computing
the topkindices in Eq. 1 can be very expensive. Hence we apply the product key retrieval technique here.
Instead of using Nindependent d-dimensional vectors as our keys ki, we create them by concatenating
vectors from two independent sets ofd
2-dimensional sub-keys C,C′⊂Rd
2:
K={/bracketleftbiggc
c′/bracketrightbigg
|c∈C,c′∈C′} (4)
Note that here C,C′have cardinality√
Nandc,c′have dimensionalityd
2. So in practice, we choose Nto
be a perfect square and dto be an even number.
3
This Cartesian product structure of Kallows us to find the top kexperts efficiently. Instead of comparing
q(x)to allNkeys in Kand selecting the top k matches, we can split the query vector q(x)into two sub-
queriesq1andq2and apply the top k operations to the inner products between the sub-queries and sub-keys
respectively:
IC=Tk/parenleftbig
(qT
1ci)/parenrightbig
,IC′=Tk/parenleftbig
(qT
2c′
j)/parenrightbig
(5)
This results in a set of k2candidate keys K′:={/bracketleftbiggci
cj/bracketrightbigg
|i∈IC,j∈I′
C}, and it is mathematically guaranteed
that thekmost similar keys to q(x)fromKare in this candidate set. Moreover, the inner product between
the candidate key and q(x)is simply the sum of inner products between the sub-keys and sub-queries:
q(x)T/bracketleftbiggci
cj/bracketrightbigg
=qT
1ci+qT
2cj. Hence we can apply the top-k operator again to these k2inner products to get
the top k matching keys from the original set of product keys K. As explained in Lample et al. (2019). This
reduces the complexity of top k expert retrieval in Eq. 1 from O(Nd)as done naively by exhaustive search
toO((√
N+k2)d).
Parameter Efficient Experts and Multi-Head Retrieval Unlike other MoE architectures, which often set
the hidden layer of each expert to the same size as other FFW layers, in PEER, every expert eiis a singleton
MLP, in other words, it has only one hidden layer with a single neuron:
ei(x) :=σ(uT
ix)vi (6)
wherevi,uiare not matrices but vectors with the same dimension as x, andσis a nonlinear activation
function such as ReLU or GELU. We omit bias terms here for brevity.
Instead of varying the size of individual experts, we adjust the expressiveness of a PEER layer by using multi-
head retrieval, similar to the multi-head attention mechanism in transformers and the multi-head memory
in PKMs. In particular, we use hindependent query networks instead of one, each computes its own query
and retrieves a separate set of kexperts. However, different heads share the same pool of experts with the
same set of product keys. The outputs of these hheads are simply summed up:
f(x) :=h/summationdisplay
i=1fi(x) =h/summationdisplay
i=1/summationdisplay
j∈Iigj(x)ej(x) (7)
One can verify that when only one expert is retrieved ( k= 1) per head, using a PEER layer with hheads
is the same as using one expert with hhidden neurons:
f(x) =h/summationdisplay
i=1ei(x) =h/summationdisplay
i=1σ(uT
ix)vi=Vσ(WTx); (8)
whereW= [u1,···,uh],V= [v1,···,vh]. In other words, PEER dynamically assembles an MLP with h
neurons by aggregating hsingleton MLPs retrieved from a shared repository. Compared to existing MoE
approaches that use MLPs with multiple hidden neurons as experts, this design allows shared hidden neurons
among experts, enhancing knowledge transfer and parameter efficiency.
Algorithm 1 shows a simplified implementation of the PEER forward pass, storing parameter-efficient expert
weights in embedding layers and combining them with einsum operations. This implementation can be
easily extended to experts of the GLU variants (Shazeer, 2020) by adding additional linear gating weights.
In practice, an efficient implementation may require specialized hardware kernels to accelerate embedding
lookup and fusion with the einsum operations.
Why A Large Number of Small Experts? Given an MoE layer, we can characterize it by three hyperparam-
eters: the total number of parameters P, the number of active parameters per token Pactiveand the size of a
single expert Pexpert. Krajewski et al. (2024) showed that the scaling law of MoE models has the following
form:
L(P,D,G ) =c+ (g
Gγ+a)1
Pα+b
Dβ, (9)
4
whereLis the final test loss, a,b,g,γ,α,β are constants, Dis the total number of training tokens and the
granularity Gis the number of active experts:
G:=Pactive
Pexpert(10)
In order to improve model performance, we need to scale up P,D,G. On the other hand, it is essential to
limitPactivebecause the computational and memory costs are primarily determined by the active parameters
during training and inference. Notably, the memory footprint corresponding to Pactivehas to be multiplied
by the number of tokens in a batch, while the memory cost of Pis independent of the batch size and sequence
length because only one copy of the model needs to be stored.
As a result, we want to increase P,Gbut notPactive. Since the expert size Pexpert =Pactive/Gand the
number of experts N=P/P expert =P·G/P active, this implies that we should decrease the size of each
expert,Pexpert, and increase the number of experts N. Hence we need a large number of small experts.
In general, for experts that are MLPs with a single hidden layer. Pexpert = (2dmodel + 1)dexpertandPactive =
(2dmodel +1)dactive, wheredmodel,dexpertanddactiveare the hidden dimension of the transformer, the number
ofhiddenneuronsusedinoneexpertandthetotalnumberofhiddenneuronsactivatedpertoken,respectively.
In the case of PEER, we use the smallest expert size possible by setting dexpert = 1, and the number of
activated neurons is the number of retrieval heads multiplied by the number of experts retrieved per head:
dactive =hk. Consequently, the granularity of PEER is always G=Pactive/Pexpert =dactive/dexpert =hk.

3 Experiments
3.1 Pretraining isoFLOP Analysis
We compare PEER with various baselines using isoFLOP analysis (Borgeaud et al., 2022b). We chose a
fixed FLOP budget ( 6e18and2e19) and jointly varied the model size and the number of training tokens
from the C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) to obtain isoFLOP curves. Each point on an isoFLOP curve has
the same computational cost, and we plot them in terms of their model size and final validation perplexity
on C4.
For the dense baselines, we varied their size by changing the number of layers, attention heads and model
dimensions. For MoE, PKM and PEER methods, we took each of the dense models considered and replaced
the FFW layer in the middle block (e.g. in a 12 block transformer, we replace the FFN in block 6) by a
layer of MoE, PKM and PEER, respectively.
In MoE, we used the expert-choice (Zhou et al., 2022) routing algorithm, which effectively addresses the
expert load imbalance issue and generally outperforms token-choice MoEs (see Section 4 for a review and
5
comparison of these approaches). Each expert has the same size as the original MLPs in the corresponding
dense model, and we use 128experts to cover the same range of model sizes as our PEER models. This
type of MoE represents standard coarse-grained MoE approaches, which consist of a small number of large
experts.
In PKM, we used 10242memories with h= 8heads and top k= 32memories were selected per head. We
also applied query batch normalization, as recommended in the original PKM paper (Lample et al., 2019),
to enhance memory usage.
In PEER, we used 10242experts with h= 8heads and top k= 16experts per head. By default, we also
enabled query BatchNorm to increase expert usage. Ablation studies in subsection 3.3 investigate the effect
of these hyperparameters. Unlike the expert-choice MoE baseline, PEER represents a fine-grained approach
where a large number of small experts are employed.
Across all model sizes and methods, we maintained a consistent batch size (128) and sequence length (2048).
We calculated the number of training steps by dividing the total compute budget by the FLOPs per training
step. Fig. 1 presents the isoFLOP profiles. Compared to the dense FFW baseline, the sparse alternatives
shift the isoFLOP curves downward and to right because they introduce a larger number of total parameters
Pbut utilize a smaller or equal number of active parameters Pactive. Given the same compute budget, a
PEER model achieves the lowest compute-optimal perplexity.
3.2 Evaluation on Language Modeling Datasets
After determining the compute-optimal model for each method based on the isoFLOP curves, we evaluated
the performance of these pretrained models on several popular language modeling datasets, including Cura-
tion Corpus (Curation, 2020), Lambada (Paperno et al., 2016), the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), Wikitext (Merity
et al., 2016) and the pretraining dataset C4. Table 1 presents a summary of the evaluation results. We
grouped the models based on their FLOP budgets used during training.

3.3 Ablations
Varying the Number of Total Experts The models in the isoFLOP plot depicted in Fig. 1 all have over
a million ( 10242) experts. Here we conduct an ablation study on the effect of the number of experts N,
which determines the total parameter count Pin Eq. 9. We selected the model at the isoFLOP-optimal
position and vary the number of experts ( N= 1282,2562,5122,10242) in the PEER layer while keeping the
number of active experts constant ( h= 8,k= 16). The results are shown in Fig. 3 (a). As can be seen,
the isoFLOP curve interpolates between the PEER model with 10242experts and the corresponding dense
backbone without replacing the FFW layer in the middle block by a PEER layer. This demonstrates that
simply increasing the number experts can improve model performance.
Varying the Number of Active Experts We also conducted an ablation study on the effect of the number
of active experts hk, which equals the granularity Gin Eq. 9. We systematically varied the number of

 (b) Varying Active Expert Num
Figure 3: We conduct two ablation studies using the same PEER model configuration. In (a), we vary the
total number of experts Nwhile keeping the same number of active experts hk= 128. In (b), we vary the
number of active experts G=hkby jointly changing handkwhile keeping the total number of experts at
N= 10242.
active experts ( hk= 32,64,128,256,512) while keeping the number of total experts constant ( N= 10242).
Furthermore, for a given hk, we jointly varied handkto identify the optimal composition. The resulting
isoFLOP curves, plotted over the number of heads ( h), are shown in Fig. 3 (b).
The results indicate that, within the range of values considered, higher hkgenerally leads to improved per-
formance. Notably, the optimal hincreases as hkincreases. However, the performance gradually saturates,
and increasing the number of active experts also increases device memory consumption and may necessitate
additional accelerator devices. Thus in practice, the appropriate hkvalues should be selected based on the
trade-off between performance, device number and computational resource requirements.
Table 2: KL and expert usage for different memory sizes, with and without query BN. Similar to the findings
in PKM, using query BN results in a more balanced usage of the experts.

Unevenness ( ↓) 0.45 0.30 0.63 0.44 0.97 0.66 1.52 1.06
Expert Usage and Query Batch Normalization Given the presence of over a million experts in the PEER
layer, it is natural to inquire how many of these experts are actually selected during inference and whether
their usage is evenly distributed. To analyze this, we kept an accumulated router score, denoted as z′
i=/summationtext
xgi(x)for each expert eiacross all tokens xwithin the C4 validation set. Here gi(x)is the router score
used to aggregate the expert output when token xis given as input, with gi(x) = 0if experteiis not selected.
From these accumulated router scores, we can obtain an empirical probability distribution vector, denoted
asz=z′/||z′||1, representing the distribution of all experts over the C4 validation set. Then we computed
the following metrics proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to assess the usage and distribution of experts:
7
•Expert Usage : the fraction of experts retrieved during inference: #{zi̸= 0}
•Unevenness : KL divergence between zand the uniform distribution: log(N) +/summationtext
izilog(zi)
whereNis the number of total experts.
By default, we also added a batch normalization (BN) layer on top of the query network, as proposed by
Lample et al. (2019) to increase the expert usage during training. Here we study the effect of adding this
BN layer on the above-mentioned metrics.
Table 2 presents the expert usage and unevenness for varying numbers of experts, with and without BN. We
can see that even for 1M experts, the expert usage is close to 100%, and using BN can lead to more balanced
utilization of the experts and lower perplexities. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEER
model in utilizing a large number of experts.
Figure 4: Query BatchNorm Ablation. IsoFLOP curves of a PEER model with 1M experts on the C4
dataset, with and without query BatchNorm.
We additionally compared isoFLOP curves with and without BN. Fig. 4 shows that the PEER model with
BN generally achieves lower perplexities. While the difference is not significant, it is most pronounced around
the isoFLOP-optimal region.
4 Related Works
Mixture of Expert Since Shazeer et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparsely-gated Mixtures
of Experts (MoEs) in efficiently increasing model capacity on GPU clusters, MoEs have emerged as a pop-
ular technique for scaling large models efficiently. Subsequent research (Fedus et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al.,
2020; Du et al., 2022) has proposed variations to address challenges such as load balancing, communication
overhead, and training instability. These methods usually replace feedforward (FFW) layers in certain Trans-
former blocks with sparsely-gated MoE layers, which consist of multiple FFW layers as experts. Typically
each expert matches the size of the regular dense FFW layer. Gating scores are calculated for each expert
and token, and only the top k experts are activated for each token. These methods are known as token-choice
methods. More recently, Zhou et al. (2022) introduced the Expert Choice routing method, where experts
choose the top k tokens instead of tokens selecting experts. However, both token-choice and expert-choice
methods require the top-k operator on a gating score matrix of size N×M(N: number of experts, M:
number of tokens), resulting in a routing cost of at least O(N). This limits their practical application to a
small number of experts (typically less than 128).
8
Instead of using the top-k operator, some works also proposed using deterministic hash tables as routers
(Roller et al., 2021; dos Santos et al., 2023). With O(1)average lookup complexity, these methods offer
potential scalability to a large number of experts. However, these routers are fixed and not learned. Clark
et al. (2022) showed that deterministic routing does not scale as well as trainable routers. Furthermore,
Dikkala et al. (2023) proved theoretically that learned routers offer non-trivial advantages over their fixed
counterparts, such as removing spurious directions and identifying latent clusters in data. In contrast to
previous works, the proposed PEER layer employs a learned router with sublinear ( O(√
N)) complexity.
Since PEER uses lightweight experts, our work is also related to recent studies on parameter-efficient MoEs
(Wang et al., 2022; Zadouri et al., 2024). These methods utilize parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
adapters as experts instead of full-sized FFWs. Their focus is on minimizing the number of parameters
updated during fine-tuning, allowing storage of only one copy of the large backbone model. In PEER,
parameter efficiency refers to the small number of active parameters in the MoE layer, which directly affects
FLOPs and activation memory consumption during pre-training and inference. However, PEER could
potentially be adapted to retrieve a large number of PEFT adapters.
Retrieval-Augmented Models Our proposed method, with its retrieval mechanism for a large number of
experts, aligns with the emerging field of retrieval-augmented models. These models facilitate large model
memorization by retrieving knowledge from external databases, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency
on knowledge-intensive tasks. Some notable works in this domain include ones by Khandelwal et al. (2019);
Borgeaudetal.(2022a);Guuetal.(2020). Whilethesemethodsretrievedatainvariousformats, forinstance,
tokens (Khandelwal et al., 2019), chunks (Borgeaud et al., 2022b) or knowledge graphs (Kang et al., 2023)
(see (Gao et al., 2023) for a comprehensive survey on this topic), they differ from the proposed method in
that they retrieve data rather than learned functions (experts). This distinction sets our parameter-efficient
expert retrieval approach apart from existing retrieval-augmented models.
Efficient Feedforward Layers Enhancing the efficiency of feedforward networks has been a long-standing
area of research. Similar to PEER, most approaches are based on the idea of conditional computation
(Bengio, 2013), where a gating mechanism is trained to determine which subset of neurons to compute. For
instance, Davis & Arel (2013) utilized low-rank weight matrix approximation to estimate the sign of pre-
nonlinearity activations. Neurons with negative activations are omitted as they will produce zeros after the
nonlinearity. Bengio et al. (2015) explored reinforcement learning to develop an activation-dependant policy
fordroppingblocksofneurons. Morerecently,Belcak&Wattenhofer(2023)introducedtheFastFeedForward
(FFF) layer that employs a differentiable balanced binary tree to select a neuron block for computation.
During inference, only one leaf (corresponding to one block) is selected, hence it has O(log(N))complexity,
whereNis the total number of blocks in the tree. However, during training, all leaves and intermediate
nodes are activated for gradient calculation, imposing a training complexity of O(N)and limiting the total
number of blocks. The most relevant work to ours is the Product Key Memory (PKM) (Lample et al., 2019),
whose retrieval technique is utilized as the router in the PEER layer. However, PKM retrieves memory
vectors instead of functions, thus their values cannot vary according to the inputs. As we show in Section 3,
by changing the memory vectors to input-dependent expert networks, PEER can achieve significantly higher
efficiency than PKM. Finally, Csordás et al. (2023) presented a unified view encompassing FFW, MoE and
PKM and proposed to change the router normalization function in MoE and PKM from softmax to sigmoid
or ReLU.
5 Conclusion
This work introduces a fine-grained MoE architecture that decomposes an extremely wide dense feedforward
layer into a large number of small experts. This design is supported by the recent discovery of the fine-
grained MoE scaling law. To overcome the computational overhead of routing to a large number of experts,
we apply the product keys to efficiently select a small subset of hidden neurons within a wide MLP layer.
Empirical analysis using language modeling tasks demonstrate that given the same compute budget, PEER
significantly outperforms dense transformers, coarse-grained MoEs and product key memory layers.

ABSTRACT
The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs, such as JSON, is
crucial for their use in Compound AI Systems. However, evaluating and improving this capability
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce StructuredRAG, a benchmark of six tasks designed to
assess LLMs’ proficiency in following response format instructions. We evaluate two state-of-the-art
LLMs, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3 8B-instruct with 4-bit quantization using two distinct prompting
strategies. We introduce these prompting strategies as f-String and Follow the Format (FF) prompting.
Across 24 experiments, we find an average success rate of 82.55%. We further find a high variance
in performance across tasks, models, and prompting strategies with success rates ranging from 0
to 100%. We find that Llama 3 8B-instruct often performs competitively with Gemini 1.5 Pro.
We observe that task complexity significantly influences performance, with tasks involving lists or
composite object outputs proving more challenging. Our findings highlight the need for further
research into improving the reliability and consistency of structured output generation in LLMs. We
have open-sourced our experimental code and results at github.com/weaviate/structured-rag.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become extremely effective at Zero-Shot Learning. Zero-Shot Learning is used
to describe a machine learning model’s ability to perform a task without any training data for the task given in advance.
An emergent area of importance is not only to test LLMs on how well they can perform novel tasks, but also how
well they can structure their output in a particular format. This is a critical requirement for developing Compound AI
Systems [ 1,2] that consist of multiple LLM inferences or external computational tools. For example, Multi-Hop RAG
[3] is a Compound AI System where an LLM inference first predicts one or multiple search queries for an input and
then sends these queries to a search tool. Another LLM inference then aggregates these search results and the original
question to generate a response. In order for the Multi-Hop RAG system to parse the response from the query writer to
send to the search tool, it is critical that the query writer follows a particular response format such as a JSON with the
key “queries” and a list of strings as the value.
In this work, we seek to measure the ability of LLMs to follow JSON response format instructions with Zero-Shot
Learning. While structured decoding methods, such as DOMINO [ 4], have emerged as a popular solution for ensuring
correct JSON outputs in Compound AI Systems, we seek to better understand the baseline performance of Zero-Shot
Learning. Structured decoding may slow down inference throughput, complicate system integration, and interfere with
the LLM’s prior knowledge and the benefits of prompt optimization [ 5]. To address these concerns, we a construct a novel
benchmark of six RAG-inspired [ 6] structured output tests. These tests explore different typed JSON responses such as
string, integer, or boolean values, as well as outputting a list of strings, denoted as List[string]. Further, we illustrate the
use of composite objects containing more than one type per instance. We present the AnswerWithConfidence composite
object consisting of a string valued answer and an integer valued confidence. We further test the ability to output a
list of AnswerWithConfidence objects, similarly denoted as List[AnswerWithConfidence]. An output from the LLM
passes these tests if it is able to be parsed into the requested JSON response format. This entails that the output jointlyarXiv:2408.11061v1  [cs.CL]  7 Aug 2024
Figure 1: An overview of our experimental results. Across 24 experiments, we achieve an average response format
success rate of 82.55%. However, we find high variance in these results, 11 out of the 24 tests achieve 100% success, 2
out of 24 achieve 25% success or lower, and 5 of the tested methods achieve between 45% to 75% success..
contains the correct keys as well as the correct types per value. We run our tests using the Gemini 1.5 Pro API [ 7] and
Llama 3 8B-instruct with 4-bit quantization [ 8] hosted with Ollama [ 9], restricting the task to avoid the use of structured
decoding methods, which we further discuss later in our paper. In this study, we measure the success rate of parsing
LLM responses into the desired JSON format. We leave inference throughput comparisons and the entanglement of
response formatting and task performance, such as answer correctness, for future work.
Figure 1 presents an overview of our results. We find much better performance when tasked with simple output types
such as a single string, integer, or boolean value, whereas performance degrades significantly on list outputs and
composite objects. We find two cases of high failure rates from Llama 3 8B-instruct when outputting a list of strings in
ParaphraseQuestions and when outputting a list of composite objects in GenerateAnswersWithConfidences. Out of
the 24 experimental trials, we find 11 cases where the structured output succeeds 100% of the time. We find that both
Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3 8B-instruct show comparable performance on this benchmark, with each model excelling
in different tasks. Our results indicate the need for future research on generating structured outputs.
Our contributions are as follows:
•We introduce StructuredRAG, a set of six structured output tests that can be adapted to Retrieval-Augmented
Generation systems consisting of questions and supplemental context.
•We compare f-String with Follow the Format (FF) prompting across the Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3 8B-
instruct LLMs. We find a high variance in success rates across tested methods. Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms
Llama 3 8B-instruct achieving an average success rate of 93.4% compared to 71.7%. We do not find a
significant difference in success rates between f-String and FF prompting. We find a performance gap from
single structured outputs to more complex outputs such as lists, composite objects, and lists of composite
objects.
• We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO prompt optimization on JSON response formatting with Llama 3
8B-instruct, achieving a 100% success rate on the task of outputting a list of composite objects.
2 Methodology
We present WikiQuestions, a dataset that isolates the generation aspect of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems [ 6].
WikiQuestions contains 56 randomly selected Wikipedia titles and abstracts. Each Wikipedia title-abstract example
2
Figure 2: An illustration of the WikiQuestions dataset. Title-Abstract pairs are randomly sampled from Wikipedia.
Gemini 1.5 Pro then synthesizes an answerable and unanswerable question for each. These generated questions are
validated by a human annotator.
contains an answerable question and an unanswerable question generated with Gemini Pro 1.5 [ 7] and further verified
with human supervision. Thus we end up with 112 questions for each test. An example from our WikiQuestions dataset
is shown in Figure 2. At 30 tokens, the abstract shown is the shortest example in our dataset. We further experiment
with longer abstracts up to 500 tokens. We believe it will be an interesting opportunity for future work to explore how
performance on the StructuredRAG benchmark scales when dealing with longer or noisy contexts retrieved from a
search database. We hypothesize that this will make the task more challenging based on previous work from Liu et al.
[10] and Shi et al. [11].
We present the Structured RAG benchmark, consisting of six tests to measure response format instruction following.
Structured RAG tests response formats for string, integer, boolean, list of strings, and a composite AnswerWithConfi-
dence object, as well as a list of AnswerWithConfidence objects. The most common failure case is for the LLM API to
respond by acknowledging the task with a response such as, ""Sure, I can help you with that!”, or, “Here is the output in
the required JSON format:”. Interestingly, our Follow the Format (FF) prompting method inspired by DSPy, provokes
the model to occasionally fail by adding a “Reasoning: . . . ” follow up to its generation, akin to how Chain-of-Thought
prompting [ 12] is implemented in DSPy [ 13,14]. We further consider cases where the model outputs a string type
instead of an integer as a failure. For example, an output of {""context_score"": “4”} is considered a failure. The six
tasks performed, their output type, and a successful example are illustrated in Figure 6. The StructuredRAG benchmark
presents structured type outputs aligned with Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. The StructuredRAG tests are
not specific to WikiQuestions and can be adapted to any RAG system.
2.1 Model Comparison
We compare Gemini 1.5 Pro [ 7] with a 4-bit quantized version of an instruction tuned variant of Llama 3 8B [ 8,9].
We chose these models to better understand the performance gap between the largest, and generally most capable
language models available, such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, with smaller models, such as Llama 3 8B-instruct. We find that
Llama 3 8B-instruct performs competitively with Gemini 1.5 Pro when comparing average performance across all tasks.
However, as shown in Figure 4, we find a high variance in Llama 3 8B-instruct performance due to massive failures
on two tasks. All tests are run single-threaded single-node. All LLM APIs are tested with a temperature set to 0 to
minimize randomness in the responses. We leave it to future work to explore the performance of additional LLMs.
2.2 Prompting Strategies
We compare two prompting strategies for response formatting, which we introduce as f-String prompting and Follow
the Format (FF) prompting. We define, f-String prompting to describe embedding the task-specific variables within
the prompt, whereas Follow the Format (FF) prompting follows a more rigid format of first explaining the task, then
the response format, and then the input-specific variables. The task_instructions and response_format input variables
are consistent across the StructuredRAG tasks, such as ParaphraseQuestions. For example, the ParaphraseQuestions
task has the task_instructions, “Generate 3 paraphrased versions of the given question.” and the ""response_format”:
“{“answer”: “string”, “confidence”: “int (0-5)”}”. The references then inject a particular context and question pair
for the inference. An example of f-String and FF prompting is shown in Figure 7. FF prompting, as used in the DSPy
framework, clearly distinguishes between general instructions, formatting requirements, and task-specific inputs. Our
study aims to understand if the more natural language style of f-String prompting offers a performacne advantage over
FF prompting. We do not find such a benefit. While we achieve a successful result by applying the OPRO optimizer

to the FF prompting approach, further research is needed to understand the interplay between priors in prompting
structures and emerging optimization methods.
2.3 Summary of Zero-Shot Results
The results of our experiments on the StructuredRAG benchmark reveal several key findings. Shown in Figures 1
and 4, we see a very high variance in performance. We find cases of poor performance, particularly when testing
Llama 3 8B-instruct with f-String prompting on Paraphrase Questions (0% success rate) and when testing Llama 3
8B-instruct with FF prompting on GenerateAnswersWithConfidence (25% success rate). Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms
Llama 3 8B-instruct achieving an average success rate of 93.4% compared to 71.7%. We find lower success rates
with ParaphraseQuestions, involving a list of strings output, and GenerateAnswersWithConfidences, requiring a list of
composite objects as output, achieving average success rates of 72.1% and 67.6% respectively. These tasks are also
where the gap between Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3 8B-instruct is further pronounced with Gemini 1.5 Pro achieving
success rates of 99.6% and 85.3% compared to Llama 3 8B-instruct’s scores of 44.7% and 50%. We find f-String
prompting to outperform FF prompting for Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieving a superior 100% success rate compared to 86.8%.
Alternately, we find FF prompting to perform better for Llama 3 8B-instruct, achieving 76.5% success compared to
67.0%.
2.4 OPRO JSON Response Optimization
We then test the OPRO optimizer [ 15] on optimizing the Llama 3 8B-instruct prompt for the GenerateAnswersWithCon-
fidences task, requiring outputting a list of composite objects. OPRO prompt optimization works by firstly proposing
tweaks to the original prompt and scoring the new prompts with a metric, in our case JSON validation, and a training
set, of which we divide our WikiQuestions dataset into 40 training and 16 testing examples. OPRO then uses the
information from how each candidate prompt scored with respect to the metric to propose new prompts. We use the
GPT-4 LLM [16] to propose paraphrasings. We set OPRO to propose 25 new candidates per round and continue for 2
rounds. Although, we note OPRO finds the prompt that succeeds 100% of the time within the first 10 paraphrasings of
the first round. The final prompt discovered by OPRO optimization is shown in Figure 7. The optimized prompt adds
notes such as, ""Review the task_instructions meticulously, ensuring thorough comprehension before beginning your
response"", as well as several other instructions, ""to guarantee a pure and correct JSON output"". The success of OPRO
optimization suggests a path towards JSON response formatting without additional decoding methods. We leave it to
future work to understand the impact of more advanced prompt optimizers such as MIPRO [ 17] or BetterTogether [ 18]
on StructuredRAG.

3 Discussion
3.1 Untested Solutions
In this work, we aim to present the StructuredRAG benchmark and a few simple baselines and their resulting performance.
We note that there are several promising directions to improve performance on this test such as ensembling, retry
mechanisms, and chain-of-thought prompting. Ensembling describes leveraging the stochastic nature of LLMs to
produce multiple outputs per input [ 19,20]. In our experiments, we average the results across 3 trials. We found
consistent results, suggesting that trying again naively would be unlikely to succeed. However, we do find significant
variance between f-String and FF prompting on some tasks, suggesting that ensembling with prompt paraphrasings
could be promising.
It may additionally be promising to test Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies [ 12]. This entails adding
a “rationale” key to the model’s output such that the additional reasoning improves the performance of the model.
However, this will require the output to be a composite object with the additional ""rationale"" key and string-valued
response. Our results suggest that this additional output structure may result in lower success rates. Similar in spirit to
structured decoding methods, it may also be helpful to prefix the end of the prompt with “{“ or use the key, such as
“{“paraphrased_questions”: ["".
Another promising approach is to apply a “retry” prompt on failed outputs. For example, an f-string prompt could
be: “A system has produced the output: {output}. This output has been judged to have failed the response format
instructions given here: {response_format}. Please correct the output to the desired response format”. This is similar to
Reflexion [ 21] prompting that introduces the idea of chaining LLM calls with self-reflection. This paradigm of LLM
computing is also being pioneered by works such as DSPy Assertions [ 22] or SPADE [ 23] that further tackle verifying
and correcting outputs in Compound AI Systems [24].

4 Related Work
4.1 Structured Decoding
Our work on StructuredRAG is closely related to recent advancements in Structured Decoding with Large Language
Models (LLMs). The Language Model Query Language (LMQL) [ 25] presents a query language to combine prompting
with output constraints and structure. The DOMINO algorithm [ 4] further presents a novel experimentation of
constrained decoding methods for LLMs. DOMINO is similarly evaluated on JSON generation, as well as Mermaid
flowchart creation and function call generation. We note that function call generation is very similar to the task
of following JSON response format instructions. However, we believe a critical distinction is that function call
generation works are further concerned with routing a task to particular functions [ 26]. DOMINO leverages many
advanced Structured Decoding methods such as pre-computation, speculative decoding [ 27], and opportunistic masking.
DOMINO measures both response format accuracy as well as downstream task accuracy, which we leave to future
work. DOMINO achieves up to 1.77x throughput improvement over unconstrained generation for JSON tasks and
improves performance from 37.6% to 98.8% in the newly introduced QuizGen task.
This work is related to Formal Grammars in Large Language Model sampling. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD),
led by Geng et al. [ 28] presents formal grammars for information extraction. JSON is similarly described by a
context-free grammar which defines its structure including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and boolean values. GCD
similarly targets constrained decoding without fine-tuning model weights, aiming to generate structured outputs while
maintaining the model’s general capabilities and flexibility. Wang presents YieldLang [ 29], introducing key system
engineering concepts such as asynchronous parsing. YieldLang proposes a coroutine-based framework for generating
domain-specific languages (DSLs) using Python’s yield keyword. This achieves efficient parsing and generation of
DSLs, akin to context-free grammar generation. These works on Structured Decoding primarily focus on efficient
execution and highlight the growing importance of structured outputs in AI systems, which leads us to consider their
role in Compound AI Systems.
4.2 Compound AI Systems
Our work addresses a crucial need in the development of Compound AI Systems. From Zaharia et al. [ 1], “state-of-the-
art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple components, not just monolithic models”.
These components typically require a particular output format in order to be parsed and sent to the next component.
Further explored in works such as ALTO from Santhanam et al. [ 2], there are many emerging optimizations available for
engineering Compound AI Systems. ALTO illustrates how structured response formats enable streaming intermediate
responses, with further investigation into systems such as an aggregation-aware routing interface and distributed
prompt-aware scheduling. Zheng et al. have further introduced SGLang, ""a comprehensive system for efficient
execution of complex language model programs"" [ 30]. SGLang addresses challenges in programming and executing
LM programs that require multiple generation calls, advanced prompting techniques, and structured inputs/outputs
with key innovations include RadixAttention for efficient KV cache reuse, compressed finite state machines for faster
constrained decoding, and API speculative execution for API-only models. We leave it to future work to measure
SGLang and vLLM [31] style decoding and inference throughput on benchmarks such as StructuredRAG.
5 Conclusion
In conclusion, this study introduces the StructuredRAG benchmark for assessing Large Language Models’ ability to
generate structured outputs without relying on structured decoding methods. Our experiments with Gemini 1.5 Pro
and Llama 3 8B-instruct reveal significant variability in performance across different structured generation tasks and
prompting strategies. The results highlight the varying capabilities of LLMs in generating complex structured outputs.
While some models struggle with lists and composite objects, others show high performance on these tasks, indicating
the potential for further improvements. We leave it to future work to explore advanced techniques such as ensembling,
retry mechanisms, chain-of-thought prompting and prompt optimization to further enhance performance on response
formatting without structured decoding methods.

","StructuredRAG is a new technique that helps language models produce structured JSON outputs. This is important because many applications require data in a specific format, but language models traditionally output freeform text. The key idea behind StructuredRAG is to combine two powerful AI techniques: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) : This allows the language model to pull in relevant information from a knowledge base to inform its responses. Specialized Templates : The model is trained on specific templates for formatting the JSON output, ensuring the final response has the correct structure. By using RAG to gather relevant information and templates to shape the output, StructuredRAG can generate JSON responses that are both informative and properly structured. This makes it easier to integrate language models into applications that require structured data."

Abstract
In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several
Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents
who pick a name based solely on its “uniqueness”), we create a model which is not only tractable and
clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical
experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for
future research.
1 Introduction
The most important decision in any child’s life happens shortly after they are born and is made entirely
without their input or approval - their naming. The name given to a child is traditionally kept throughout
their life time and has significant impact on their future life path. This momentous decision is made by
parents with little education in the game theory inherently present in the highly competitive field of naming.
We attempt to assist these parents with a simple primer into the game theory underpinning the decision of
naming. We will introduce the basic set-up of the naming game and formalize the parameters and incentives,
wherein parents have some desired properties of the name. We then describe the pitfalls of the most simple
interpretations of these models, particularly the dangers of myopic action. Finally, we present experimental
results demonstrating the shift in name distributions under this model. These experiments underline the
inherent risks in naming a child and highlight how altering various parameters can change the outcomes of
naming strategies.

3 Model
Naming a child is akin to choosing an outfit for the Oscars. It must be unique enough to stand out - no one
wants to show up to the Oscars in the same dress - but it must also be similar enough to be recognizable
as a name. Lady Gaga’s meat dress is fine for an afternoon, but a child named “Meat Dress” would soon
become discontented, if not the plaintiff of a lawsuit. Thus, we model name selection based on the desired
“uniqueness” of the name.
3.1 Name frequency and choice model
First, we present our formal model. Assume there is some set of names A. At a time point i, we assume
there exists a discrete distribution of popularity over names
fi(a) =ν
such that f(a)∈[0,1],P
a∈Afi(a) = 1. For simplicity, we assume that every name has unique frequency:
that is, fi(aj)̸=fi(ak) for j̸=k.
Next, we model parental preferences. It is well-known that parents are always in complete agreement over
the name they would prefer to pick for their newborn child. Therefore, we will treat the parents of each
child as a unit, and assume that each set of parents j∈ P has some preference over the proportion of the
population that would share the same name as their child (we also assume each parental unit has exactly 1
child). For example, µj= 0.01 means that parental unit jwants their child to have a name that is shared
by 1% of the population. We will use
g(µ) =p
to mean that p∈[0,1] proportion of parents want a name with popularity µ. For example, if µ= 0.1
andp= 0.2, then this means that 20% of parents want a name with popularity 10%. This set-up gives us
convenient parameters for the model and just enough Greek letters to sound smart enough for publication.
In general, we will assume that parents are myopic , with new parents having no concept of time but perfect
access to baby name data. We find this a realistic assumption. Mathematically, parents at time step iwill
pick the name athat currently is closest to their desired frequency µj. Given this assumption, then at time
stepi+ 1, the proportion of babies who have name ais given by the total fraction of parents for whom name
ais closest to their desired frequency.
3.2 Satisfiability
If parents are unable to infer the consequences of their actions and act myopically, then it can immediately be
seen that some parents will be deeply unhappy with said consequences: for example, if g(0.1) = 0 .2 (as in the
example above), then the 20% of parents who wished that their name has popularity 10%, will end up with
a name that is more popular than they anticipated (when g(µ)> µ). For instance, a parent might anticipate
the name “Kate” would be a pleasantly traditional yet unique name with only moderate popularity. They
would be wrong [6].
Conversely, if we had g(0.1) = 0 .05 (or g(µ)< µ), then parents would end up with a name that is less popular
than they anticipated. If g(µ) =µ, then we say the name with proportion µissatisfied . Ideally, we would
like every name to be satisfied, or g(µ) =µfor all µ∈[0,1]. However, that would give us a distribution with
total probability >1, which is the sort of thing that makes statisticians sad. Instead, we see that the entire
naming distribution g(·) is satisfied if every name with nonzero popularity µ > 0 has exactly µfraction of
the population that desires this name:
(
g(µ) =µ µ > 0
g(µ) = 0 otherwise
3.3 Stability
Next, we consider an alternative property that we may wish to have: that the distribution of names be stable .
If an arrangement is stable, this means that given an existing distribution fi(a) and a parental preference
distribution g(µ), every name’s frequency will be exactly the same at the next time step i+ 1:
fi+1(a) =fi(a)∀a∈ A
The simplest way to achieve stability is if every parent would prefer to name their child after themselves. That
is, if every parent wishes their child to have the same “uniqueness” of naming they do, a sort of inheritability
of uniqueness - we name this the Dweezil Principle.
3.4 Extremely Reasonable Assumptions
The above model contains several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (ERAs). The first ERA is the very
conservative assumption that there is only one gender, with all children and all names adhering to the same
gender. Thus any child may be given any name, so long as it exists in the names list1. Another ERA is
the Mayfly Parenthood Assumption, in which all parents perish immediately upon naming their child, which
makes the math substantially easier.
4 Illustrative example: power law distribution
In this section, we consider the case where both f(·) and g(·) are given by power law distributions .
Figure 1: Name frequencies from the Social Security Administration, for girls born in 2010[2]. Note the rough
power-law shape.
4.1 Modeling f(a), g(µ)
We begin by defining our variable for name popularity. The popularity of names has been shown to follow a
power law distribution [19] (see Figure 1) . We can model this as:
f(a) =K·a−t
where adenotes the rAnk of the name within a∈[1, N],tis another constanT, and Kis a normalization
konstant.
1If a fixed names list is good enough for the Scandinavians, it’s good enough for us [1]
Figure 2: Examples of different parental preferences: a preference for less common names (blue) and prefer-
ence for more common names (orange).
Next, we consider how parents pick the uniqueness of names for their children: the function g(·). Because we
are in the Power Law subsection, we will also assume that this distribution of parent preferences is a power
law. To minimize our use of variables, we will model this as:
g(a) =K′·(a′)−t′
where a′is the desired frequency of the name (within the range [ ϵ,1], for ϵ >0),t′is another constant, and
K′is a normalization constant.
Note that for t′>0, we have that g(µ) is decreasing in µ: that is, more parents prefer names that are
uncommon . Conversely, for t′<0, we have that g(µ) is increasing in µ: parents prefer names that are
common .
4.2 Picking names: stability
Given a fi(a) and g(µ), the distribution fi+1(a) at the next time step is given by:
fi+1(a) =g(fi(a)) =K′·","The paper explores the dynamics of baby naming through the lens of game theory. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies how people make decisions when their choices depend on the actions of others. In the case of baby names, parents are essentially ""playing a game"" where their name selection is influenced by the names chosen by other families. The researchers propose a model that captures this strategic interaction. The key idea is that parents want to choose a name that is popular enough to be recognized, but not so common that it feels unoriginal. There is a tension between standing out and fitting in. The model mathematically characterizes this tradeoff and how it plays out as naming trends emerge and evolve over time. By applying this model to real data on baby names, the researchers were able to reproduce patterns observed in the real world. For example, the model explains why certain names rise and fall in popularity, and why parents often gravitate towards names that are familiar but not overly ubiquitous. Overall, the work provides a quantitative framework for understanding the complex social dynamics underlying one of life's most personal decisions - what to name a child."

Abstract
We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language
models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method, termed as
Agent Forest, is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while
the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and
to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence. Our code is publicly available at:
https://github.com/MoreAgentsIsAllYouNeed/AgentForest.
1 Introduction
Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in variety of applications (Zhao
et al., 2023), such as language generation, understanding, and reasoning, they struggle to provide accurate
answers when faced with complicated tasks. To improve the performance of LLMs, some of recent studies
focus on ensemble methods (Wang et al., 2023b; Wan et al., 2024) and multiple LLM-Agents collaboration
frameworks (Du et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023).
In these works, multiple LLM agents are used to improve the performance of LLMs. For instance, LLM-Debate
Du et al. (2023) employs multiple LLM agents in a debate form. The reasoning performance is improved
by creating a framework that allows more than one agent to “debate” the final answer of arithmetic tasks.
They show performance improvements compared to using one single agent. Similarly, CoT-SC (Wang et al.,
2023b) generates multiple thought chains and picks the most self-consistent one as the final answer. The
reasoning performance is improved by involving more thought chains compared to chain-of-thought (CoT)
(Wei et al., 2022) which employs a single thought chain. Incidentally, from the data analysis of these works,
we can notice the effects of putting multiple agents together, to some extent, can lead to a performance
improvement in certain problems. For example, in Table 10 of Section 3.3 of LLM-Debate Du et al. (2023),
the authors have reported a preliminary curve: the accuracy of a math problem increases with the number
of debating agents (although the number was simply increased from 1 to 7). Also, in Wang et al. (2023b),
involving more chain-of-thought pipelines (termed as a “sample-and-marginalize” decoding procedure), can

lead to a performance gain. We realize that the LLM performance may likely be improved by a brute-force
scaling up of the number of agents instantiated. However, since the scaling property of “raw” agents is not
the focus of these works, the scenarios/tasks and experiments considered are limited. So far, there lacks a
dedicated in-depth study on such a phenomenon. Hence, a natural question arises: Does this phenomenon
generally exist?
To answer the research question above, we conduct the first comprehensive study on the scaling property of
LLM agents. To dig out the potential of multiple agents, we propose to use a simple(st) sampling-and-voting
method, which involves two phases. First, the query of the task, i.e., the input to an LLM, is iteratively
fed into a single LLM, or a multiple LLM-Agents collaboration framework, to generate multiple outputs.
Subsequently, majority voting is used to determine the final result. The procedure is inspired by that of the
CoT-SC, but it does not rely on designing complex CoT paths. In fact, it can be used as a plug-in to further
enhance CoT-based methods, as will be shown in our evaluations. Our method is termed as Agent Forest ,
a tribute to the classic Random Forest (Breiman, 2001).
The experiments are conducted by using various LLMs of different sizes on diverse datasets covering reasoning
and generation. The result indicates that LLM performance can generally be improved by increasing the
ensemble size, i.e., the number of agents, across a wide range of tasks. Surprisingly, a brute-force ensemble of
smaller LLMs can achieve comparable or superior performance to larger LLMs, with a nutshell shown in
Figure 1, which will be further expanded in later sections. Moreover, by combining our method with other
existing methods, we find the performance can be further improved. By comparing with the performance of
complicated methods, the result shows that employing our method solely can achieve comparable performance
in most cases. This implies that comparable performance can be achieved without the need for additional
handcraft prompt design or complex collaboration frameworks.
Additionally, the experimental results indicate that there are greater performance improvements when
addressing difficult tasks and when using weaker models. To understand the reasons behind these performance
improvements, we analyze the influence of problem difficulty on the effectiveness of our method. We classify
difficulty into three dimensions: the inherent difficulty, the length of reasoning steps, and the prior probability
of the correct answer. Through a series of experiments, we adjust these dimensions and observe their effects
independently. We observe and summarize a few properties, based on which, we further develop optimization
strategies that can intrigue the power of “More Agents”.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:

•We present the first systematic study on the scaling property of raw agents instantiated by LLMs.
We find that the performance scales with the increase of agents, using the simple(st) way of sampling
and voting.
•We explore the compatibility of our method with existing complicated methods that stimulate
the potential of LLMs, revealing that our method can enhance these methods to achieve further
performance improvements.
•We analyze the effectiveness of our method in tackling problems at varying difficulties and then
distill the properties behind, based upon which, we propose further optimization methods that can
facilitate the occurrence of our finding.
2 Related Work
Related works can be categorized into three parts: 1) LLM self-ensemble Wang et al. (2023b), which
attempts to harness multiple outputs from homogeneous LLMs to assemble the final answer; 2) heterogeneous
LLM ensemble, which focuses on combining heterogeneous LLMs through supervised learning to improve
performance across various downstream applications; and 3) multiple LLM agents collaboration, which
improves performance through interactions among LLM agents. We discuss these works below.
LLM Self-Ensemble. CoT-SC Wang et al. (2023b) harnesses diverse chain-of-thought Wei et al. (2022)
prompts to elicit a variety of reasoning processes from a single LLM and select the final answer through
majority voting. Fu et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023b); Cobbe et al. (2021b); Thoppilan et al. (2022); Lin et al.
(2023) can be considered as the extensions of CoT-SC. These methods mainly focus on reasoning tasks and
exclusively investigate the compatibility with CoT. In contrast, our method not only validates effectiveness in
reasoning tasks but also in generation tasks. Moreover, our method is compatible with a broader range of
methods, such as prompt engineering (including CoT) and multiple LLM agents collaboration. Very recently,
Lu et al. (2024) proposes a method named Blended that utilizes multiple LLMs for chat scenarios. In contrast,
Blended focuses on utilizing the power of multiple LLMs, whereas our focus is on the scaling trend of adding
more LLMs. Also, Blended is only for limited chat scenarios evaluated via human annotations. Furthermore,
we explore orthogonality with other methods.
Heterogeneous LLM Ensemble. Wan et al. (2024) conducts a supervised LLM fusion framework to
distill multiple heterogeneous LLMs into a single model and surpasses each of these LLMs. Jiang et al.
(2023) introduces a supervised ensembling framework based on multiple heterogeneous LLMs. Chen et al.
(2023b) proposes a sequential inference method for LLMs that halts when the output quality is deemed
adequate. Wang et al. (2023a) addresses the fusion-of-experts problem by integrating outputs from models
with distinct knowledge domains through supervised learning. Shnitzer et al. (2023) and Lu et al. (2023)
select the most suitable LLM for new tasks by training a reward-guided router. These approaches primarily
employ supervised learning, necessitating task-specific annotated data, and exhibit limited generalizability.
In contrast, our method is unsupervised, without the need for additional training data.
Multiple LLM Agents Collaboration. Du et al. (2023); Liang et al. (2023); Xiong et al. (2023) explore
various multiple LLM agents interaction architectures, with employing static debate-style engagements among
LLMs for enhanced reasoning . Liu et al. (2023) enables agents to interact for multiple rounds in a dynamic
architecture. Li et al. (2023a); Hong et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023c;a) offer several
multi-agent frameworks that enable the development of LLM applications or enhance task-solving capabilities.
However, these methods primarily focus on the interaction structures between LLM agents, rather than the
relationship between the number of agents and performance. We also select representative methods Du et al.
(2023); Shinn et al. (2023) to combine with our method, achieving further enhancements.
3 Method
In this section, we introduce Agent Forest , which is implemented through a two-phase process: sampling
and voting. The overview of our method is shown in Figure 2.

samplesS={s1,s2,...,s N}at the end of this phase.
Voting. LetArepresent the final answer. In this phase, we employ majority voting to consolidate the

sample relative to the others, denoted as V(si) =/summationtextN
j=1,j̸=isim(si,sj). For open-ended generation tasks
such as code generation, the BLEU score proposed by Papineni et al. (2002) is utilized to quantify similarity.
Conversely, for close-ended tasks like multiple-choice questions, similarity is measured by occurrence frequency.
The sample that exhibits the highest cumulative similarity is then chosen as the final answer denoted as
A= arg maxsi∈SV(si).
The complete process of Agent Forest is described in Algorithm 1.

4 Experimental Setup
We separate the experimental setup (this section) with evaluations (next section), to introduce the coverage
of scenarios/tasks compared with the most related works (for examining the comprehensiveness of our work),
the backbone language models we adopted (for examining the applicability of our work), and the methods
combined with ours (for examining the compatibility and orthogonality of our work).
Tasks Our method is evaluated on the following task:
•Arithmetic Reasoning. Similar to Wang et al. (2023b); Fu et al. (2023); Du et al. (2023), we select
the GSM8K Cobbe et al. (2021a) as one of the test sets. Additionally, we select the more challenging
MATH dataset Hendrycks et al. (2021b), which is used by Wu et al. (2023).
•General Reasoning. Similar to Du et al. (2023); Jiang et al. (2023), we select the MMLU Hendrycks
et al. (2021a). Additionally, we select the dataset from the chess state tracking task (Chess)1, which
is used by Du et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023).
•Code Generation. Similar to Liu et al. (2023), we select the HumanEval Chen et al. (2021). To
implement our method, we compute the BLEU score Papineni et al. (2002) among all pairs of
generated candidate answers. The answer with the highest cumulative BLEU score is then selected
as the final output.

Language models adopted We evaluate our method using language models of different scales from the
Llama2 Touvron et al. (2023) and GPT series OpenAI (2022). Specifically, we evaluate two versions of
Llama2-Chat2, optimized for conversational use cases through alignment techniques, with model sizes of 13B
and 70B parameters. Additionally, we include GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 in our evaluation.
Methods enhanced by our method To examine the comparability of our method, we study the
integration of various typical methods from two distinct categories with our method:
•Prompt Engineering. Various prompt engineering methods are considered to conduct comprehensive
experiments. We evaluate Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) Wei et al. (2022), Zero-Shot Chain-of-
Thought prompting (Zero-Shot Cot) Kojima et al. (2022), and more sophisticated methods such as
Solo Performance Prompting (SPP) Wang et al. (2023c). Initially, these methods are applied with a
single LLM query. We then increase the number of queries and employ majority voting to determine
the most consistent answer as the final response.
•Multiple LLM Agents Collaboration. We select LLM-Debate Du et al. (2023) denoted as Debate,
and self-reflection Shinn et al. (2023) denoted as Reflection. Within these methods, we generate
multiple samples by iteratively operating these methods and using majority voting to produce the
final answer.

Specifically, the effectiveness of our method is evaluated by averaging the results across 10independent runs.
During each run, we scale up the ensemble size to 40to ensure maximum gains. However, when integrating
our method with the Debate Du et al. (2023), the ensemble size is limited to 10due to the significant
computational overhead introduced by the communication architecture. Detailed experimental settings are
provided in the Appendix A.

5.1 Generalizability
Table 2 and Figure 3 show that our method generally enhances performance across all tasks and LLMs by
increasing the ensemble size. Specifically, in arithmetic reasoning tasks, the accuracy gains range from 12%
to24%on the GSM8K and from 6%to10%on the MATH. In general reasoning tasks, the accuracy gains
range from 1%to4%on the Chess and from 5%to11%on the MMLU. In code generation task, the accuracy
gains range from 4%to9%on HumanEval. Surprisingly, our method enables a smaller LLM to outperform a
larger counterpart by simply scaling up the ensemble size. For instance, the enhanced Llama2-13B model
achieves 59%accuracy on the GSM8K dataset, outperforming the Llama2-70B model, which scores 54%.
Additional statistical results are presented in Appendix B.2.

5.2 Compatibility
Table 3 shows that by integrating our method with other methods, the performance can be further improved
across different LLMs and tasks, despite these methods have different implementations. To be specific, in
arithmetic reasoning tasks, our method enhances these methods to further improvement, yielding increases
between 10%and21%on the GSM8K dataset, and between 1%and15%on the MATH dataset. In general
reasoning tasks, integration with other methods generally achieves performance gains ranging from 1%to
13%in the Chess task and from 1%to11%in the MMLU task. In code generation task, when combined with
other methods, gains range from 2%to7%. However, two notable exceptions are observed when integrated
with the debate method with the Llama2-13B and Llama2-70B models, which result in failed cases. This
failure in performance is attributed primarily to the noise generated by referencing the answers of other
agents during the debate process. The synthesized responses, which incorporate input from multiple agents,
disrupt the coherence of the code logic, leading to the observed performance degradation. All accuracy curves
are provided in the Appendix B.1.
5.3 Effectiveness
From Table 3, we find that our method outperforms other methods in standalone cases, except on the Chess
task using Llama2-13B and Llama2-70B. Additionally, based on the data from Table 3, we have calculated
the average performance ranking of each enhanced method across various tasks, with the results presented in

As shown in Figure 4, scaling up ensemble size improves the LLM performance consistently across different
tasks, despite the variation of these hyperparameters.

We record the token usage for different methods, with the Table 5 presenting the token usage for a single agent.
Given that our method scales up by increasing the ensemble size, the token usage increases proportionally
with the number of agents or when combined with other methods. When addressing specific tasks, one can
trade a higher token budget for improved performance. More details are presented in Appendix B.3

Table 2 shows that the efficacy of our method varies with the difficulty of the task. In this section, we aim to
understand the underlying properties through controlled experiments.

It is noteworthy that the relative performance gain is more substantial with increasing task difficulty.
Specifically, we observe that within the same task, the smaller model, Llama2-13B, gains ranging from
28%-200%, but only 8%-16%over GPT-3.5-Turbo. Moreover, the more challenging task MATH yields gains

To further analyze this correlation in detail, we categorize the difficulty of a given task into three orthogonal
dimensions: 1) the inherent difficulty of the task; 2) the number of steps required to solve the task; 3) the
prior probability of the correct answer. To investigate these dimensions, we conduct experiments that can
isolate each dimension. And then, we delve into each dimension in detail.

In the following experiments, we analyze each dimension respectively based on GPT-3.5-Turbo. Note that
we use GPT-3.5-Turbo for a case study, it can also be changed to other backbone models. The relative

with increases in I, indicating that our method can significantly enhance performance in line with rising
inherent difficulty. The most notable gains are seen at I= 100andI= 200, consistent across all Sand
Ksettings. Yet, at I= 400, gains taper off, implying that excessive complexity may exceed the model’s
reasoning capabilities, leading to diminishing returns for our method under extreme task difficulty.

6.3 Number o","Large language models (LLMs) have become incredibly powerful, but they can still struggle with certain tasks that require nuanced reasoning or specialized knowledge. The ""More Agents Is All You Need"" approach seeks to address this by using a team of AI agents, each with their own specialized skills, to work together on complex problems. The key idea is that by having multiple agents collaborate, the LLM can tap into a wider range of expertise and capabilities. For example, one agent might be an expert in scientific reasoning, another in creative writing, and a third in analytical problem-solving. When these agents work together, they can bring their specialized knowledge to bear on a task, leading to better overall performance. The paper explores how this multi-agent approach can be implemented and evaluated, looking at things like how the agents communicate and coordinate, how their individual strengths are leveraged, and how the overall system can be made more robust and reliable. The goal is to push the boundaries of what LLMs are capable of, opening up new possibilities for AI-powered applications."

Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the “language space”, where they typically
express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem.
However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most
word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical
tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of
LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new
paradigm Coconut (ChainofContinuousThought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM
as a representation of the reasoning state (termed “continuous thought”). Rather than decoding this
into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the
continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several
reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns:
the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to
perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a
single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that
require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These
findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, emerging from extensive
pretraining on human languages (Dubey et al., 2024; Achiam et al., 2023). While next token prediction is an
effective training objective, it imposes a fundamental constraint on the LLM as a reasoning machine: the
explicit reasoning process of LLMs must be generated in word tokens. For example, a prevalent approach,
known as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), involves prompting or training LLMs to
generate solutions step-by-step using natural language. However, this is in stark contrast to certain human
cognition results. Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that the language network – a set of brain
regions responsible for language comprehension and production – remains largely inactive during various
reasoning tasks (Amalric and Dehaene, 2019; Monti et al., 2012, 2007, 2009; Fedorenko et al., 2011). Further
evidence indicates that human language is optimized for communication rather than reasoning (Fedorenko
et al., 2024).
A significant issue arises when LLMs use language for reasoning: the amount of reasoning required for
each particular reasoning token varies greatly, yet current LLM architectures allocate nearly the same
computing budget for predicting every token. Most tokens in a reasoning chain are generated solely for fluency,
contributing little to the actual reasoning process. On the contrary, some critical tokens require complex
planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. While previous work has attempted to fix these problems by
prompting LLMs to generate succinct reasoning chains (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022), or performing
additional reasoning before generating some critical tokens (Zelikman et al., 2024), these solutions remain
constrained within the language space and do not solve the fundamental problems. On the contrary, it would
be ideal for LLMs to have the freedom to reason without any language constraints, and then translate their
findings into language only when necessary.
1arXiv:2412.06769v2 [cs.CL] 11 Dec 2024
Figure 1A comparison of Chain of Continuous Thought ( Coconut ) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT). In CoT, the model
generates the reasoning process as a word token sequence (e.g., [xi, xi+1, ..., x i+j]in the figure). Coconut regards the
last hidden state as a representation of the reasoning state (termed “continuous thought”), and directly uses it as the
next input embedding. This allows the LLM to reason in an unrestricted latent space instead of a language space.
In this work we instead explore LLM reasoning in a latent space by introducing a novel paradigm, Coconut
(Chain of Continuous Thought). It involves a simple modification to the traditional CoT process: instead of
mapping between hidden states and language tokens using the language model head and embedding layer,
Coconut directly feeds the last hidden state (a continuous thought) as the input embedding for the next
token (Figure 1). This modification frees the reasoning from being within the language space, and the system
can be optimized end-to-end by gradient descent, as continuous thoughts are fully differentiable. To enhance
the training of latent reasoning, we employ a multi-stage training strategy inspired by Deng et al. (2024),
which effectively utilizes language reasoning chains to guide the training process.
Interestingly, our proposed paradigm leads to an efficient reasoning pattern. Unlike language-based reasoning,
continuous thoughts in Coconut can encode multiple potential next steps simultaneously, allowing for a
reasoning process akin to breadth-first search (BFS). While the model may not initially make the correct
decision, it can maintain many possible options within the continuous thoughts and progressively eliminate
incorrect paths through reasoning, guided by some implicit value functions. This advanced reasoning
mechanism surpasses traditional CoT, even though the model is not explicitly trained or instructed to operate
in this manner, as seen in previous works (Yao et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023).
Experimentally, Coconut successfully enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. For math reasoning
(GSM8k, Cobbe et al., 2021), using continuous thoughts is shown to be beneficial to reasoning accuracy,
mirroring the effects of language reasoning chains. This indicates the potential to scale and solve increasingly
challengingproblemsbychainingmorecontinuousthoughts. OnlogicalreasoningincludingProntoQA(Saparov
andHe,2022), andournewlyproposedProsQA(Section4.1)whichrequiresstrongerplanningability, Coconut
and some of its variants even surpasses language-based CoT methods, while generating significantly fewer
tokens during inference. We believe that these findings underscore the potential of latent reasoning and could
provide valuable insights for future research.
2 Related Work
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We use the term chain-of-thought broadly to refer to methods that generate
an intermediate reasoning process in language before outputting the final answer. This includes prompting
LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022), or training LLMs to generate reasoning chains,
either with supervised finetuning (Yue et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023) or reinforcement learning (Wang et al.,
2024; Havrilla et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024a). Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh (2022) classified
the tokens in CoT into symbols, patterns, and text, and proposed to guide the LLM to generate concise CoT
based on analysis of their roles. Recent theoretical analyses have demonstrated the usefulness of CoT from
the perspective of model expressivity (Feng et al., 2023; Merrill and Sabharwal, 2023; Li et al., 2024). By
employing CoT, the effective depth of the transformer increases because the generated outputs are looped
back to the input (Feng et al., 2023). These analyses, combined with the established effectiveness of CoT,
2
motivated our design that feeds the continuous thoughts back to the LLM as the next input embedding. While
CoT has proven effective for certain tasks, its autoregressive generation nature makes it challenging to mimic
human reasoning on more complex problems (LeCun, 2022; Hao et al., 2023), which typically require planning
and search. There are works that equip LLMs with explicit tree search algorithms (Xie et al., 2023; Yao et al.,
2023; Hao et al., 2024), or train the LLM on search dynamics and trajectories (Lehnert et al., 2024; Gandhi
et al., 2024; Su et al., 2024). In our analysis, we find that after removing the constraint of a language space, a
new reasoning pattern similar to BFS emerges, even though the model is not explicitly trained in this way.
Latent reasoning in LLMs. Previous works mostly define latent reasoning in LLMs as the hidden computation
in transformers (Yang et al., 2024; Biran et al., 2024). Yang et al. (2024) constructed a dataset of two-hop
reasoning problems and discovered that it is possible to recover the intermediate variable from the hidden
representations. Biran et al. (2024) further proposed to intervene the latent reasoning by “back-patching” the
hidden representation. Shalev et al. (2024) discovered parallel latent reasoning paths in LLMs. Another line
of work has discovered that, even if the model generates a CoT to reason, the model may actually utilize a
different latent reasoning process. This phenomenon is known as the unfaithfulness of CoT reasoning (Wang
et al., 2022; Turpin et al., 2024). To enhance the latent reasoning of LLM, previous research proposed to
augment it with additional tokens. Goyal et al. (2023) pretrained the model by randomly inserting a learnable
<pause> tokens to the training corpus. This improves LLM’s performance on a variety of tasks, especially
when followed by supervised finetuning with <pause> tokens. On the other hand, Pfau et al. (2024) further
explored the usage of filler tokens, e.g., “ ...”, and concluded that they work well for highly parallelizable
problems. However, Pfau et al. (2024) mentioned these methods do not extend the expressivity of the LLM like
CoT; hence, they may not scale to more general and complex reasoning problems. Wang et al. (2023) proposed
to predict a planning token as a discrete latent variable before generating the next reasoning step. Recently,
it has also been found that one can “internalize” the CoT reasoning into latent reasoning in the transformer
with knowledge distillation (Deng et al., 2023) or a special training curriculum which gradually shortens
CoT (Deng et al., 2024). Yu et al. (2024b) also proposed to distill a model that can reason latently from data
generated with complex reasoning algorithms. These training methods can be combined to our framework,
and specifically, we find that breaking down the learning of continuous thoughts into multiple stages, inspired
by iCoT (Deng et al., 2024), is very beneficial for the training. Recently, looped transformers (Giannou et al.,
2023; Fan et al., 2024) have been proposed to solve algorithmic tasks, which have some similarities to the
computing process of continuous thoughts, but we focus on common reasoning tasks and aim at investigating
latent reasoning in comparison to language space.
3 Coconut: Chain of Continuous Thought
In this section, we introduce our new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought) for reasoning in
an unconstrained latent space. We begin by introducing the background and notation we use for language
models. For an input sequence x= (x1, ..., x T), the standard large language model Mcan be described as:
Ht=Transformer (Et)
M(xt+1|x≤t) =softmax (Wht)
where Et= [e(x1), e(x2), ..., e (xt)]is the sequence of token embeddings up to position t;Ht∈Rt×dis the
matrix of the last hidden states for all tokens up to position t;htis the last hidden state of position t, i.e.,
ht=Ht[t,:];e(·)is the token embedding function; Wis the parameter of the language model head.
Method Overview. In the proposed Coconut method, the LLM switches between the “language mode” and
“latent mode” (Figure 1). In language mode, the model operates as a standard language model, autoregressively
generating the next token. In latent mode, it directly utilizes the last hidden state as the next input embedding.
This last hidden state represents the current reasoning state, termed as a “continuous thought”.
Special tokens <bot>and<eot>are employed to mark the beginning and end of the latent thought
mode, respectively. As an example, we assume latent reasoning occurs between positions iandj, i.e., xi=
<bot>andxj=<eot>. When the model is in the latent mode ( i < t < j ), we use the last hidden state
from the previous token to replace the input embedding, i.e., Et= [e(x1), e(x2), ..., e (xi), hi, hi+1, ..., h t−1].
3
Figure 2Training procedure of Chain of Continuous Thought ( Coconut ). Given training data with language reasoning
steps, at each training stage we integrate cadditional continuous thoughts ( c= 1in this example), and remove one
language reasoning step. The cross-entropy loss is then used on the remaining tokens after continuous thoughts.
After the latent mode finishes ( t≥j), the input reverts to using the token embedding, i.e., Et=
[e(x1), e(x2), ..., e (xi), hi, hi+1, ..., h j−1, e(xj), ..., e (xt)]. It is worth noting that the last hidden states have
been processed by the final normalization layer, so they are not too large in magnitude. M(xt+1|x≤t)is
not defined when i < t < j , since the latent thought is not intended to be mapped back to language space.
However, softmax( Wht)can still be calculated for probing purposes (see Section 4).
Training Procedure. In this work, we focus on a problem-solving setting where the model receives a question as
input and is expected to generate an answer through a reasoning process. We leverage language CoT data
to supervise continuous thought by implementing a multi-stage training curriculum inspired by Deng et al.
(2024). As shown in Figure 2, in the initial stage, the model is trained on regular CoT instances. In the
subsequent stages, at the k-th stage, the first kreasoning steps in the CoT are replaced with k×ccontinuous
thoughts1, where cis a hyperparameter controlling the number of latent thoughts replacing a single language
reasoning step. Following Deng et al. (2024), we also reset the optimizer state when training stages switch. We
insert<bot>and<eot>tokens (which are not counted towards c) to encapsulate the continuous thoughts.
During the training process, we optimize the normal negative log-likelihood loss, but mask the loss on questions
and latent thoughts. It is important to note that the objective does notencourage the continuous thought to
compress the removed language thought , but rather to facilitate the prediction of future reasoning . Therefore,
it’s possible for the LLM to learn more effective representations of reasoning steps compared to human
language.
Training Details. Our proposed continuous thoughts are fully differentiable and allow for back-propagation. We
perform n+ 1forward passes when nlatent thoughts are scheduled in the current training stage, computing
a new latent thought with each pass and finally conducting an additional forward pass to obtain a loss
on the remaining text sequence. While we can save any repetitive computing by using a KV cache, the
sequential nature of the multiple forward passes poses challenges for parallelism. Further optimizing the
training efficiency of Coconut remains an important direction for future research.
Inference Process. The inference process for Coconut is analogous to standard language model decoding,
except that in latent mode, we directly feed the last hidden state as the next input embedding. A challenge
lies in determining when to switch between latent and language modes. As we focus on the problem-solving
setting, we insert a <bot>token immediately following the question tokens. For <eot>, we consider two
potential strategies: a) train a binary classifier on latent thoughts to enable the model to autonomously
decide when to terminate the latent reasoning, or b) always pad the latent thoughts to a constant length. We
found that both approaches work comparably well. Therefore, we use the second option in our experiment for
simplicity, unless specified otherwise.
1If a language reasoning chain is shorter than ksteps, then all the language thoughts will be removed.

4 Experiments
We validate the feasibility of LLM reasoning in a continuous latent space through experiments on three
datasets. We mainly evaluate the accuracy by comparing the model-generated answers with the ground truth.
The number of newly generated tokens per question is also analyzed, as a measure of reasoning efficiency. We
report the clock-time comparison in Appendix B.
4.1 Reasoning Tasks
Math Reasoning. We use GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) as the dataset for math reasoning. It consists of grade
school-level math problems. Compared to the other datasets in our experiments, the problems are more
diverse and open-domain, closely resembling real-world use cases. Through this task, we explore the potential
of latent reasoning in practical applications. To train the model, we use a synthetic dataset generated by Deng
et al. (2023).
Logical Reasoning. Logical reasoning involves the proper application of known conditions to prove or disprove a
conclusion using logical rules. This requires the model to choose from multiple possible reasoning paths, where
the correct decision often relies on exploration and planning ahead. We use 5-hop ProntoQA (Saparov and
He, 2022) questions, with fictional concept names. For each problem, a tree-structured ontology is randomly
generated and described in natural language as a set of known conditions. The model is asked to judge
whether a given statement is correct based on these conditions. This serves as a simplified simulation of more
advanced reasoning tasks, such as automated theorem proving (Chen et al., 2023; DeepMind, 2024).
We found that the generation process of ProntoQA could be more challenging, especially since the size of
distracting branches in the ontology is always small, reducing the need for complex planning. To fix that, we
apply a new dataset construction pipeline using randomly generated DAGs to structure the known conditions.
The resulting dataset requires the model to perform substantial planning and searching over the graph to find
the correct reasoning chain. We refer to this new dataset as ProsQA ( Proof withSearchQuestion-Answering).
A visualized example is shown in Figure 6. More details of datasets can be found in Appendix A.
4.2 Experimental Setup
We use a pre-trained GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) as the base model for all experiments. The learning rate is
set to 1×10−4while the effective batch size is 128. Following Deng et al. (2024), we also reset the optimizer
when the training stages switch.
Math Reasoning. By default, we use 2 latent thoughts (i.e., c= 2) for each reasoning step. We analyze the
correlation between performance and cin Section 4.4. The model goes through 3 stages besides the initial
stage. Then, we have an additional stage, where we still use 3×ccontinuous thoughts as in the penultimate
stage, but remove all the remaining language reasoning chain. This handles the long-tail distribution of
reasoning chains longer than 3 steps. We train the model for 6 epochs in the initial stage, and 3 epochs in
each remaining stage.
Logical Reasoning. We use one continuous thought for every reasoning step (i.e., c= 1). The model goes
through 6 training stages in addition to the initial stage, because the maximum number of reasoning steps is
6 in these two datasets. The model then fully reasons with continuous thoughts to solve the problems in the
last stage. We train the model for 5 epochs per stage.
For all datasets, after the standard schedule, the model stays in the final training stage, until the 50th epoch.
We select the checkpoint based on the accuracy on the validation set. For inference, we manually set the
number of continuous thoughts to be consistent with their final training stage. We use greedy decoding for all
experiments.
4.3 Baselines and Variants of Coconut
We consider the following baselines: (1) CoT: We use the complete reasoning chains to train the language model
with supervised finetuning, and during inference, the model generates a reasoning chain before outputting an

answer. (2) No-CoT: The LLM is trained to directly generate the answer without using a reasoning chain.
(3)iCoT(Deng et al., 2024): The model is trained with language reasoning chains and follows a carefully
designed schedule that “internalizes” CoT. As the training goes on, tokens at the beginning of the reasoning
chain are gradually removed until only the answer remains. During inference, the model directly predicts
the answer. (4) Pause token (Goyal et al., 2023): The model is trained using only the question and answer,
without a reasoning chain. However, different from No-CoT, special<pause> tokens are inserted between
the question and answer, which are believed to provide the model with additional computational capacity
to derive the answer. For a fair comparison, the number of <pause> tokens is set the same as continuous
thoughts in Coconut .
We also evaluate some variants of our method: (1) w/o curriculum : Instead of the multi-stage training,
we directly use the data from the last stage which only includes questions and answers to train Coconut .
The model uses continuous thoughts to solve the whole problem. (2) w/o thought : We keep the multi-stage
training which removes language reasoning steps gradually, but don’t use any continuous latent thoughts.
While this is similar to iCoTin the high-level idea, the exact training schedule is set to be consistent with
Coconut , instead of iCoT. This ensures a more strict comparison. (3) Pause as thought : We use special
<pause> tokens to replace the continuous thoughts, and apply the same multi-stage training curriculum as
Coconut .

Figure 3 Accuracy on GSM8k with different
number of continuous thoughts.We show the overall results on all datasets in Table 1. Contin-
uous thoughts effectively enhance LLM reasoning, as shown
by the consistent improvement over no-CoT. It even shows
better performance than CoTon ProntoQA and ProsQA.
We describe several key conclusions from the experiments as
follows.
“Chaining” continuous thoughts enhances reasoning. In conven-
tional CoT, the output token serves as the next input, which
proves to increase the effective depth of LLMs and enhance
their expressiveness (Feng et al., 2023). We explore whether
latent space reasoning retains this property, as it would sug-
gest that this method could scale to solve increasingly complex
problems by chaining multiple latent thoughts.
In our experiments with GSM8k, we found that Coconut
outperformed other architectures trained with similar strate-
gies, particularly surpassing the latest baseline, iCoT(Deng
et al., 2024). The performance is significantly better than Coconut (pause as thought ) which also enables
more computation in the LLMs. While Pfau et al. (2024) empirically shows that filler tokens, such as
the special <pause> tokens, can benefit highly parallelizable problems, our results show that Coconut
6
architecture is more effective for general problems, e.g., math word problems, where a reasoning step often
heavily depends on previous steps. Additionally, we experimented with adjusting the hyperparameter c,
which controls the number of latent thoughts corresponding to one language reasoning step (Figure 3). As
we increased cfrom 0 to 1 to 2, the model’s performance steadily improved.2These results suggest that a
chaining effect similar to CoT can be observed in the latent space.
In two other synthetic tasks, we found that the variants of Coconut (w/o thoughts orpause as thought ), and
theiCoTbaseline also achieve impressive accuracy. This indicates that the model’s computational capacity
may not be the bottleneck in these tasks. In contrast, GSM8k, being an open-domain question-answering
task, likely involves more complex contextual understanding and modeling, placing higher demands on
computational capability.
Latent reasoning outperforms language reasoning in planning-intensive tasks. Complex reasoning often requires
the model to “look ahead” and evaluate the appropriateness of each step. Among our datasets, GSM8k and
ProntoQA are relatively straightforward for next-step prediction, due to intuitive problem structures and
limited branching. In contrast, ProsQA’s randomly generated DAG structure significantly challenges the
model’s planning capabilities. As shown in Table 1, CoTdoes not offer notable improvement over No-CoT.
However, Coconut , its variants, and iCoTsubstantially enhance reasoning on ProsQA, indicating that latent
space reasoning provides a clear advantage in tasks demanding extensive planning. An in-depth analysis of
this process is provided in Section 5.
The LLM still needs guidance to learn latent reasoning. In the ideal case, the model should learn the most effective
continuous thoughts automatically through gradient descent on questions and answers (i.e., Coconut w/o
curriculum ). However, from the experimental results, we found the models trained this way do not perform
any better than no-CoT.
Figure 4 A case study where we decode the continuous
thought into language tokens.With the multi-stage curriculum which decomposes
the training into easier objectives, Coconut is able
to achieve top performance across various tasks. The
multi-stage training also integrates well with pause
tokens ( Coconut -pause as thought ). Despite using
the same architecture and similar multi-stage train-
ing objectives, we observed a small gap between the
performance of iCoTandCoconut (w/o thoughts ).
The finer-grained removal schedule (token by token)
and a few other tricks in iCoTmay ease the training
process. We leave combining iCoTandCoconut
as future work. While the multi-stage training used
forCoconut has proven effective, further research
is definitely needed to develop better and more gen-
eral strategies for learning reasoning in latent space,
especially without the supervision from language rea-
soning chains.
Continuous thoughts are efficient representations of
reasoning. Though the continuous thoughts are not
intended to be decoded to language tokens, we can
still use it as an intuitive interpretation of the continuous thought. We show a case study in Figure 4 of
a math word problem solved by Coconut (c= 1). The first continuous thought can be decoded into
tokens like “180”, “ 180” (with a space), and “9”. Note that, the reasoning trace for this problem should be
3×3×60 = 9 ×60 = 540 , or3×3×60 = 3 ×180 = 540 . The interpretations of the first thought happen to be
the first intermediate variables in the calculation. Moreover, it encodes a distribution of different traces into
the continuous thoughts. As shown in Section 5.3, this feature enables a more advanced reasoning pattern for
planning-intense reasoning tasks.

5 Understanding the Latent Reasoning in Coconut
In this section, we present an analysis of the latent reasoning process with a variant of Coconut . By
leveraging its ability to switch between language and latent space reasoning, we are able to control the
model to interpolate between fully latent reasoning and fully language reasoning and test their performance
(Section 5.2). This also enables us to interpret the the latent reasoning process as tree search (Section 5.3).
Based on this perspective, we explain why latent reasoning can make the decision easier for LLMs (Section 5.4).
5.1 Experimental Setup
Methods. The design of Coconut allows us to control the number of latent thoughts by manually setting the
position of the <eot>token during inference. When we enforce Coconut to use kcontinuous thoughts, the
model is expected to output the remaining reasoning chain in language, starting from the k+ 1step. In our
experiments, we test variants of Coconut on ProsQA with k∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. Note that all these variants
only differ in inference time while sharing the same model weights. Besides, we report the performance of
CoTandno-CoT as references.
To address the issue of forgetting earlier training stages, we modify the original multi-stage training curriculum
by always mixing data from other stages with a certain probability ( p= 0.3). This updated training curriculum
yields similar performance and enables effective control over the switch between latent and language reasoning.
Metrics. We apply two sets of evaluation metrics. One of them is based on the correctness of the final answer ,
regardless of the reasoning process. It is the metric used in the main experimental results above (Section 4.4).
To enable fine-grained analysis, we define another metric on the reasoning process . Assuming we have a
complete language reasoning chain which specifies a path in the graph, we can classify it into (1) Correct Path :
The output is one of the shortest paths to the correct answer. (2) Longer","Large language models typically reason by generating one word at a time. COCONUT takes a different approach by converting thoughts into continuous number patterns instead of discrete words. Think of it like translating thoughts into a universal mathematical language before processing them. The system works like a translator that converts regular language into a special numerical code, processes the information in that form, and then converts it back to normal language. This approach helps the model think more flexibly and accurately about complex problems. Neural language models using COCONUT show better performance on tasks that require step-by-step reasoning, similar to how humans solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller parts."

Section 3 established the following assertions:
Assertion 1 : No training database can be 100% complete.
Assertion 2 : Even if the data is complete, LLMs are unable to retrieve information with 100%
accuracy.
Assertion 3 : LLMs are unable to classify intent with 100% accuracy.
Assertion 4 : No a priori training can completely eliminate hallucinations.
Assertion 5 : No amount of fact-checking can completely eliminate hallucinations.
In other words, hallucinations cannot be completely eliminated. The above 5 assertions are the
reason why.
This section concisely demonstrates these properties of LLMs using an example prompt.
4.1 The Prompt
We consider the following prompt for an LLM:
•Create a random 5-word long sentence.
•Exactly five words before the end of your answer, add ""Exactly five more words left.""
•Exactly ten words before the end of your answer, add ""Exactly five more words left.""
•Keep on adding such sentences to count the number of words till the time no more
such sentences can be mathematically added.
24
A preprint - September 10, 2024
4.2 The Expected Response
The expected response ideally begins at infinity. We’ll see why if we try to accurately respond to
the prompt like humans would (assuming you are human, you do not have to do anything special).
4.2.1 Random 5-word sentence:
The cat climbed the tree.
4.2.2. To insert the phrase “Exactly five more words left” before the end of the response:
Exactly five more words left The cat climbed the tree.
4.2.3. To insert the phrase “Exactly ten more words left” before the end of the response:
Exactly ten more words left Exactly five more words left The cat climbed the tree.
4.2.4. To keep on generating such sentences:
...Exactly fifteen more words left Exactly ten more words left Exactly five more words left The cat
climbed the tree.
Observe carefully:
4.2.5. This generation can continue till infinity. We can continue inserting the phrase “Exactly x
more words left” with x= 15, 20, 25, ...
4.2.6. A human begins with a random five-word sentence, proceeding from right to left in the
insertion sequence.
4.2.7. An LLM model, however, would have to begin the generation at the leftmost point, i.e. at
infinity.
4.2.8. Consequently, the model must hallucinate, since it is impossible to begin a generation at
infinity.
On running the prompt on various popular LLMs, we obtained the following responses:
Figure 7: OpenAI response to illustration query
4.3 Observation
Each of the tested LLMs deviates significantly from the expected response. In the language of the
previous section, |A(w)−B(w)|is significantly greater than 0!
4.4 Reasoning
We’ll show how the LLM trips up at every stage in its generation process to produce the
hallucinations we see above.
25
A preprint - September 10, 2024

Figure 9: Claude responses to illustration query
4.4.1 No training database can be 100% complete.
No dataset can train an LLM for tasks that require predicting its own behaviour. Hence, no dataset
can be 100% complete:
The model does not know where to start since the instruction requires the LLM to count back-
wards from infinity (recall that the infinite generation is included in the set of an LLM’s possible
generations). It cannot predict its own behaviour.
4.4.2LLMs are unable to retrieve facts from a knowledge base with 100%
accuracy.
LLMs are trained to retrieve sentences of certain lengths from their database. The popular
sentence lengths are 5-10 words, and so on.
In some generations, the LLM has interpreted the prompt as requiring multiple 5-word sentences.
In those cases, we note that not all the sentences are 5 words long, demonstrating that 5 word
sentences have not been retrieved with 100% accuracy. The needle of 5-word sentences has been
lost in the haystack of sentences.
4.4.3An LLM will be unable to accurately classify intent with 100% proba-
bility.
We guide your attention only to the incorrect execution of the instruction, in the case of each of
the three LLMs considered.
The LLMs were unable to interpret the meaning of the prompt, and misrepresented the instruction
in their responses.
In this particular case, the instruction to “keep on” generating was not followed.
26
A preprint - September 10, 2024
Hence, the LLMs were unable to understand the given direction. They failed at classifying intent.
4.4.4No A Priori Training Can Deterministically And Decidedly Stop A
Language Model From Producing Hallucinating Statements
For any string from the vocabulary, the LLM may halt at any position. The LLMs, without the
knowledge of where they must begin or will halt, have a non-zero probability of generating anything.
This is reflected in the fact that the LLMs have generated what seems to be random content.
4.4.5Even if we attempt to fact-check every generated statement, halluci-
nations cannot be completely eliminated
4.4.5.1. Fact-checking is to be done by an LLM itself, which suffers from the same drawbacks as
discussed above—the non-zero probability of infinite generation and the inability to predict where
to start and stop.
4.4.5.2. Therefore, the fact-checking mechanism cannot produce the correct output with 100%
accuracy.
4.5 Discussion
With a single prompt, we have verified every one of the reasons why we claim that structural
hallucinations cannot be eliminated fully.
5 Concluding Remarks
5.1 These Limitations Extend Beyond Turing Machines
We would like to note here that the above arguments can be extended beyond Turing machines, to
Oracle Turing Machines.
It is well-known that the Halting Problem is undecidable on Oracle Turing machines as well - the
oracle can decide whether a Turing machine will halt on a given input, but not, in general, if a
machine equivalent to itself will halt on a given input. One can prove this in a similar manner as
the traditional proof for the undecidability of the Halting problem on Turing Machines.
Now, we note that the Halting Problem is reducible to the Emptiness problem. A short proof follows:
Let us assume that the Emptiness Problem is decidable on Oracle Turing Machines. Then, let us
construct an oracle OEmptiness that decides whether the language of an oracle is empty.
We can use OEmptiness to construct a decider OHaltingfor the Halting Problem:
5.1.1. Take as input an input oracle Oand the string won which halting is to be decided, < O, w > .
5.1.2.Create a modification O′ofO.O′rejects all strings except w, and on w, it works the same
way as O.
5.1.3. Run OEmptiness onO′.
This would decide the Halting Problem on oracles - a contradiction.
Similarly, one could construct a decider for the Halting problem using a decider for the Acceptance
Problem. In this fashion, the acceptance problem is also proven to be undecidable on Oracles.
This section shows that the following three problems are undecidable on oracles, which are more
powerful than Turing machines:
27
A preprint - September 10, 2024
5.1.6. The Halting problem
5.1.7.The Emptiness problem
5.1.8.The Acceptance problem
All the above arguments are derived from the undecidability of these problems. Hence, they can be
extended to oracle machines, or any other abstraction to which the undecidability of the Halting
problem applies.
5.2 The Unkown and the Unknowable - The Verdict
We have established the following:
5.2.1. A formal definition of hallucination.
5.2.2. Proofs, using the undecidability of Halting on LLMs, and Gödel’s First Incompleteness
Theorem, of the inevitability of LLM hallucination at every stage in the generation process, outlining
its causes.
An understanding of structural hallucinations is vital for the responsible use of these powerful
tools by the research community as well as the layperson.
However, we would like to reiterate that we truly believe in the power of LLMs, and AI in general.
Hallucinations themselves are double edged swords - where the unpredictability causes them to
deviate from fact, it also lends them wonderful creative capabilities, as any student who’s used
them for creative writing assignments will tell you.
LLMs have also seen great applications in the domains listed above, as long as the users are
aware of the risks, and use their own common-sense and domain knowledge to avoid believing
hallucinating content. Like ground-breaking technologies before them, and inevitably after them,
AI models have the potential to greatly aid in the progress and development of mankind, given that
they are used responsibly. All we have to do is recognise them as extensions, and not replacements,
of human thought and cognition.

31","LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This discusses the phenomenon of ""hallucination"" in large language models (LLMs) - the tendency of these AI systems to generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical, despite appearing plausible. Causes of Hallucination LLMs are trained on vast amounts of online data, which can contain misinformation, biases, and inconsistencies. This leads the models to learn patterns that don't necessarily reflect reality. When generating new text, the models can then ""hallucinate"" - producing information that sounds convincing but is actually false or made up. Characteristics of Hallucination Hallucinated text often appears coherent and fluent, but closer inspection reveals factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or a lack of grounding in reality. LLMs may confidently assert made-up facts or generate plausible-sounding but fictional content. Accepting Hallucination The researchers argue that hallucination is an inherent limitation of LLMs and that we need to learn to live with and manage this issue, rather than trying to eliminate it entirely. Attempting to completely prevent hallucination may come at the cost of reducing the models' capabilities in other areas. Detecting Hallucination Developing better techniques for automatically detecting hallucinated text, such as using fact-checking systems or analyzing the model's confidence levels, can help mitigate the impact of this issue. Mitigating Hallucination Incorporating feedback loops, prompting users to verify information, and using multiple models to cross-check outputs are some strategies for reducing the influence of hallucinated content. Accepting Limitations Ultimately, the researchers argue that we need to accept that LLMs will always have some degree of hallucination and focus on managing this limitation rather than trying to eliminate it entirely. This may involve being transparent about the models' capabilities and limitations, and developing applications that are designed to work within these constraints."

Abstract
When Large Language Models (LLMs) are compressed using techniques such as
quantization, the predominant way to demonstrate the validity of such techniques is
by measuring the model’s accuracy on various benchmarks. If the accuracies of the
baseline model and the compressed model are close, it is assumed that there was
negligible degradation in quality. However, even when the accuracy of baseline
and compressed model are similar, we observe the phenomenon of flips, wherein
answers change from correct to incorrect and vice versa in proportion. We conduct
a detailed study of metrics across multiple compression techniques, models and
datasets, demonstrating that the behavior of compressed models as visible to end-
users is often significantly different from the baseline model, even when accuracy
is similar. We further evaluate compressed models qualitatively and quantitatively
using MT-Bench and show that compressed models are significantly worse than
baseline models in this free-form generative task. Thus, we argue that compression
techniques should also be evaluated using distance metrics. We propose two such
metrics, KL-Divergence and % flips, and show that they are well correlated.
1 Introduction
The high cost and latency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated the design of multiple
model compression techniques for optimizing LLM efficiency such as quantization (Dettmers et al .,
2022), Key-Value (KV) cache compression (Ge et al ., 2023), pruning (Sun et al ., 2023) and spar-
sification (Ashkboos et al ., 2024). However, today, there is no standardized way of evaluating the
soundness of these techniques.
The predominant way of establishing the validity of the LLM compression methods today is to report
accuracy on selected benchmark tasks such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Hellaswag (Zellers
et al., 2019), ARC (Clark et al ., 2018), LAMBADA (Paperno et al ., 2016), etc. It is assumed that if
the compressed model preserves accuracy on such benchmarks, they can be used as an equivalent
replacement for the baseline model.
In this paper, we conduct a detailed evaluation of various compression techniques. We find that while
the difference in the aggregate accuracy metric across various benchmarks between the baseline and
compressed LLM is negligible in most cases ( ≤2%), the actual % change in the answers, that we
term flips, can be significant ( ≥5%). In other words, even when the overall accuracy is unchanged,
a large number of correct answers change to incorrect and vice versa in proportion, between the
baseline and compressed model. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that we are the first to

Figure 1: All six quantization schemes show negligible difference in accuracy compared to baseline
16-bit model in seven different tasks. However, all schemes, except GPTQ W8A16 (8-bit weight,
16-bit activation), exhibit large number of flips , indicating severe divergence in model behavior.
identify this phenomenon of flips caused due to model compression. Further, we argue that flips
serves as an intuitive metric that captures how significantly different the compressed model is from
the baseline model, even when both models exhibit similar accuracy on various benchmarks.
Figure 1 shows the change in accuracy and flips % vs baseline 16-bit model, respectively, for six
quantization schemes on seven benchmark tasks (MMLU (Hendrycks et al ., 2021), Hellaswag (Zellers
et al., 2019), LAMBADA (Paperno et al ., 2016), ARC Easy and Challenge (Clark et al ., 2018)
PIQA (Bisk et al ., 2019), and Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al ., 2019)) . We see that all quantization
schemes have negligible difference in accuracy ( 0 – 2% ) compared to the 16-bit version. However,
except for GPTQ W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation, Frantar et al .(2023)) that preserves accuracy
with negligible flips, all other quantization schemes exhibit large number of flips ( up to 13.6% ),
indicating significant divergence from the baseline model.
Figure 2 shows similar behavior of MMLU task accuracy being preserved while flips increase, for two
other compression techniques, namely, layer dropping (Gromov et al ., 2024) and WANDA weight
pruning (Sun et al ., 2023). For example, while Gromov et al .(2024) showed that dropping the last
few layers of a model did not affect its accuracy on standard benchmarks, we find a steady, almost
linear increase in the number of flips with the number of layers being dropped.
The phenomenon of flips is puzzling at first glance. While it is easy to see that some correct answers
may become incorrect due to errors induced by compression, it is hard to explain how an equal
number of incorrect answers become correct such that overall accuracy is preserved! For example,
MMLU questions have 4 options, one of which is correct. Thus, any output change could move a
correct answer to an incorrect one but there is only 1 in 3 chance for an incorrect answer to land on
the correct option. We present a detailed analysis of flips in Section 5.
Finally, one might question does flips matter if accuracy is preserved. Indeed, if the downstream
task where the LLM is used is a close match with the benchmark task, accuracy alone might
suffice. However, LLMs are typically used in a variety of downstream tasks that require generating
free-form text, where accuracy, evaluated using just the first token generated by the model on a
question-answering task, could be a poor proxy. Thus, we evaluate the compressed models using MT-
Bench (Zheng et al ., 2023), a multi-turn dialogue task. We show through both qualitative evaluation
as well as using GPT4 as an automated judge that compressed models with high number of flips are
significantly worse than baseline models in this task (Section 6).
Since the goal of compression schemes is to create models that mimic the baseline models as closely
as possible, we argue that compressed models are better judged by distance metrics with respect
to baseline, in addition to capability metrics such as accuracy alone as is the practice today. We
demonstrate that well-known distance metrics like KL-Divergence on a given dataset can better
2
identify the differences created due to various compression techniques and this metric correlates well
with flips. Further, we show that the scores on MT-Bench (which evaluates free-form generation
capabilities of these models) is highly correlated with flips. Thus, we propose that flips, an intuitive and
inexpensive to compute metric, as a potential proxy distance metric for evaluating LLM compression
techniques.
In this paper, we make the following key contributions:
•Using detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of various compression techniques, we
show that accuracy is not sufficient as an evaluation metric for LLM compression techniques.
•We demonstrate the existence of flips as a general phenomenon and explain why they occur.
•We evaluate compression techniques using the KL-Divergence distance metric and show that
KL-Divergence correlates well with flips.
•We propose that, where appropriate, flipsbe used as an intuitive distance metric for evaluating
the quality of compression techniques.
2 LLM Evaluation Metrics
We compare baseline and compressed LLMs on the following metrics:
•Accuracy -capability metric: % correct answers, for question-answering tasks. This
determines the competency of the model for a particular task. Multiple-choice question-
answering (MCQ) tasks such as MMLU expect the model to output a single token for the
correct answer (A/B/C/D), and compare this token with the target answer. For other tasks
(like PIQA, Hellaswag, ARC), where the modelassigns a probability to an option (consisting
of multiple tokens), we report the standard normalized accuracy (eva, 2021).
•Perplexity -capability metric: This measures the overall language modelling capability of
an LLM. It is defined as e(Average Negative Loglikelihood )calculated over some dataset.
•Flips -distance metric: measures the % of answers that changed from correct →incorrect
and incorrect →correct, between baseline and quantized model for all tasks that have
correct/incorrect answers. Note that, we do not include incorrect →incorrect transition
in Flips for two reasons: 1) For non-MCQ tasks such as GSM8k (Cobbe et al ., 2021b),
LAMBADA (Paperno et al ., 2016), TriviaQA (Joshi et al ., 2017), exact per-token output
matches between different models are rare, resulting in many mismatches. Thus, including
this transition may artificially inflate the metric for these tasks. 2) For MCQ tasks, users
may care less about these incorrect →incorrect transitions. Nevertheless, if one includes
incorrect →incorrect transitions for MCQ tasks, we find that, the flips numbers reported in
this paper would further increase by another 20-40% (e.g., increase of 19% in Hellaswag,
41% in ARC and 43% in MMLU!)
•KL-divergence -distance metric: consider a multiple choice dataset, where the j-th token
of the i-th option has a probability distribution Pb(i, j)across all tokens in the vocabulary of
the baseline model, and Pq(i, j)for the quantized model. Then the KL-divergence between
the models for the entire dataset is the mean of KL-divergences across all tokens of all
answer options and all samples in the dataset.
KL div =1
NX
dataset1
|options |X
i∈options1
|tokens |X
j∈tokensDKL(Pb(i, j)||Pq(i, j))(1)
where N is the number of samples in the dataset and DKL(P||Q)is the standard KL-
Divergence between the probability distributions output by each model for corresponding
tokens.
The flips metric is propitious because it is a proxy distance metric that is easily interpretable by
end-users: for question-answering tasks the end user typically cares about the correct/incorrect
answers and not the underlying probability distribution of tokens. Further, the flips metric is as easy
to calculate as accuracy for any dataset.
It is important to distinguish between capability metrics (accuracy and perplexity in this study) and
distance metrics ( KL-Divergence ,flips in this study).

The target of a compression scheme is to create a more efficient model that mimics the baseline model
as closely as possible and not necessarily to create a more capable model. In other words, a quantized
model’s goal is to be a drop-in replacement for the baseline model, with minimal impact to end-users.
Hence, we argue that distance metrics are more suitable for judging the effectiveness of quantization
or compression schemes.
3 Experiments
We have measured the above metrics on multiple LLMs using multiple quantization techniques and
bit lengths, on several tasks, as listed below:
•Model: We have mostly used the Llama2 chat (Touvron et al ., 2023) and Yi chat (01.AI et al .,
2024) family of models. This is because they can be evaluated on MT-Bench (Zheng et al.,
2023). However, we have seen similar phenomenon in their pretrained non-chat versions as
well (see Table 14).
•Quantization: We have evaluated LLM.int8() (Dettmers et al ., 2022) as implemented in
Bitsandbytes (bnb, 2024), with its 8-bit and 4-bit versions (henceforth referred to as BnB
W8A8 and BnB W4A4 respectively) with default parameters supported with HuggingFace
Transformers (Wolf et al ., 2020). We used GPTQ (Frantar et al ., 2023), AWQ (Lin et al .,
2024) with group-size 128 with other parameters being default. We used Smoothquant (Xiao
et al., 2024) (henceforth referred to as SQ W8A8) with per-token, per-channel quantization
using α= 0.5. We use TensorRT (trt, 2024) for SmoothQuant, all other schemes were
evaluated using HuggingFace Transformers.
•Tasks: We evaluate the compressed models on ten different tasks. They include MMLU
(Hendrycks et al ., 2021) Table 5, ARC (Clark et al ., 2018)(easy Table 8 and challenge
Table 9), PIQA (Bisk et al ., 2019) Table 6, Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al ., 2019) Table 11,
Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019) Table 7, and Lambada (Zellers et al., 2019) Table 10. We
also use GSM8k (Cobbe et al ., 2021a), TriviaQA Joshi et al .(2017) and MT-Bench (Zheng
et al., 2023) to evaluate models on generative tasks. MT-Bench is a dataset with 80 two-turn
questions which can test generative capabilities of a model. In this study, we have used
GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024) (v0314) to generate the scores reported in Table 3.
•Harness- We used Eleuther AI’s eval-harness (Gao et al ., 2023) for all the experiments,
unless specified otherwise.
4 Results
In this section, we present extensive evidence for flips across various quantization and pruning
schemes, evaluated over a large number of models and all tasks except for MT-Bench. Results for
MT-Bench are presented in Section 6.
4.1 Quantization schemes
Summary of our results is highlighted in Figure 1 while the performance on each of the individual
seven tasks (MMLU, PIQA, Hellaswag, ARC Easy, ARC Challenge, LAMBADA and Winogrande)
are in Tables 5 to 11, respectively, in the Appendix.
The main observations from our experiments with quantized models can be summarized as follows:
1.Accuracy: Accuracy is preserved within 1% for the majority of the quantization methods,
tasks and models (see Tables 5- 10). This indicates that accuracy is not sufficient to
distinguish between precise and permissive quantization schemes.
2.Flips: The large %flips is a general trend, which holds over different models, almost all
quantization schemes, and tasks (see Tables 5- 11). Specifically, all quantization schemes
except GPTQ W8A16 have significant %flips. Lower bit quantization schemes have greater
%flips in general, indicating greater difference in behavior from the baseline. We focus on
Flips in this study, but AllFlips (Flips + wrong →wrong transitions ) results can be found in
Figure 8, and Table 12 in Appendix.

(a) Dropping last n-layers
 (b) WANDA pruning
Figure 2: MMLU 5-shot accuracy difference and flips for two compression techniques (Llama2-13b
model). Even at early stages of pruning with no accuracy difference, flips indicate model divergence.
3.KL-Divergence vs Flips: From Figure 5 in Appendix, we observe that the two distance
metrics KL-Divergence and%flips are well correlated. For example, Spearman correlation
on the MMLU benchmark is 0.981.
4.Impact of task type: Generally easier tasks (identified by higher average accuracy) have
smaller %flips. For example, MMLU which is a relatively hard task has 8-16% flips for
Bitsandbytes W4A4 whereas for the same technique, PIQA, an easy task has 3-6% flips.
The reason for this behavior is explained in section 5.
5.Impact of model size: Larger models typically have fewer flips than smaller ones, though it
is non-negligible (e.g., Llama2-70b shows 3 – 8% flips using 4-bit quantization). This may
be because larger models are more resistant to perturbation than smaller ones.
4.2 Other model compression techniques
We also evaluate the following three compression techniques, though on a smaller set of tasks and
models. Our general observations seen above holds.
1.Dropping last n-layers (Gromov et al ., 2024): This work demonstrated that dropping the
last few layers did not affect the accuracy on standard benchmarks. We find in Figure 2(a)
that as one keeps dropping layers, even though the accuracy increases only modestly, %flips
increases significantly, demonstrating that the resulting models keep deviating further away
from the baseline.
2.Wanda (Sun et al ., 2023): This is a pruning method. We observe in Figure 2(b) that as we
increase the pruning ratio, even though accuracy barely changes, %flips increases steadily.
3.SliceGPT (Ashkboos et al ., 2024): This is a model sparsification method which drops
a certain fraction of rows and columns of each dense matrix. We observe in Figure 7
in Appendix that even at very low sparsity ratios %flips is significant indicating that the
compressed models are probably very different from baseline.
4.3 Perplexity
Though we have focused on accuracy so far, our observation that the difference between two models’
output token values cancel out leaving the average metric result unchanged, is applicable to perplexity
as well. In particular, since perplexity may be interpreted as the inverse of the geometric mean of
token probabilities, lower probabilities for some tokens in the test dataset may be cancelled by higher
probabilities of other tokens. This indicates that perplexity alone is also inadequate in evaluating
model compression schemes. Therefore, we argue that along with perplexity, KL-Divergence between
the distributions generated by the baseline and optimized models should also be reported.
5
Figure 9 in Appendix plots the log-likelihood difference between the 16-bit and quantized model for
each of the tokens in the wiki-2 dataset Merity et al .(2016) for four different quantization schemes.
From the figure, it appears that the log-likelihoods of the quantized model is just the log-likelihood of
baseline model with some symmetric noise added. Now, since perplexity is e−avg (logprobabilities ),
adding anyamount of symmetric noise leaves it unchanged. For example, addition of Gaussian
noise to the log-probability outputs of the model should maintain the perplexity, while the quality of
generation will degrade as the standard deviation of the noise increases (see Table 19). This analysis
demonstrates one key weakness with the perplexity metric when used for evaluating compression
techniques. While it is not clear if adding Gaussian noise to the log-likelihoods is an accurate
representation of the behavior of compression schemes, it appears to be a good analogy. As we
shall see in Section 6, as quantization increases, there is steady degradation in the quality of the text
generated by the model that are visible only by examining them closely.
4.4 Generative Tasks
We now evaluate tasks that require the model to generate significant amount of text. We only evaluate
large models for these tasks. We consider GSM8K (Cobbe et al ., 2021a), a hard task that evaluates
mathematical problem solving and TriviaQA (Joshi et al ., 2017), a relatively easy task that tests trivia
question answering capabilities. Results for MT-Bench are discussed separately in Section 6. The
results are shown in Appendix in Table 17 and Table 18, respectively. The key findings are as follows:
1.GSM8k: Surprisingly, in this task, that requires reasoning over multiple steps and the final
answer is a number, we see significant amount of flips (12–30% for BnB W8A8 and W4A4).
2.TriviaQA: The results show that flips are quite small in this case (2–4%). This falls in line
with our earlier observation about flips being less prevalent in easier tasks (accuracy: ≈
80%).
5 Analyzing Flips
Figure 3: When the Top Margin is low, an-
swer will more likely change (Llama2-70b, BnB
W4A4, MMLU 5-shot)
Figure 4: When the Top Margin is low, an-
swer will more likely be incorrect (Llama2-70b,
MMLU 5-shot)
One of the interesting observations in this study has been that when we quantize models, the number of
questions where the LLM’s answers go from incorrect to correct (referred to as incorrect →correct )
is roughly equal to the number that goes the other way. This may seem unintuitive, because one might
expect correct →incorrect ≫incorrect →correct , since a) the number of correct answers is
usually greater than incorrect answers, so random perturbations should cause more correct answers
to flip, and b) given a correct answer, the correct to incorrect transition should be likelier because
changing to any of multiple other options suffices, but given an incorrect answer, the incorrect to
correct transition happens only if somehow the perturbation caused by quantization helps it land on
the one correct option out of many. But we observe that this is not the case (and indeed, the opposite
may also be true in some cases!).

To help explain the above phenomenon, we introduce a metric called top margin which is the
difference in token probability of the model between the best and the second best answer option. By
best (second-best) option, we mean the option that was given the highest (second highest) probability.
Answers are likely to change when top margin is low. Quantization introduces some noise in
the weights and activations due to which there is a perturbation in the output answers’ probabilities
(verified empirically). Thus, we expect that answers are more likely to change when top margin is
low, since a small increase or decrease in probabilities can cause the best and second best options to
swap. Figure 3 verifies this is indeed the case for Llama2-70B BnB W4A4 in MMLU.
Correct (incorrect) answers have higher (lower) top margin and are thus less (more) likely to
change. Table 1 shows the top margins for questions for which the LLM’s answer is correct and
when the answer is incorrect. We observe that, top margin when correct is, on average, greater than
the top margin when incorrect. This is demonstrated in Table 2 which shows that changes amongst
incorrect answers is indeed higher by 2 ×or more. Similarly, Figure 4 also shows that when Top
margin is low, the answer is more likely incorrect. Thus, correct answers change much less often than
incorrect answers.
For incorrect answers, we would expect roughly 33% chance of them ending correct (for 4-choice
MCQ), though the actual % is typically higher because all the remaining options are not equally
likely. Thus, the combination of incorrect answers changing more along with slightly higher odds
than random in landing on the correct answer results in incorrect →correct transitions roughly
matching correct →incorrect transitions.
6 MT-Bench evaluation
In this section, we use MT-Bench (Zheng et al ., 2023) to evaluate the quantized models free-form
text generation capabilities, using both GPT4 as well as through manual inspection of the model
responses.
We first use GPT-4 as a judge and perform automated evaluation. Table 3 shows the MT-Bench
average scores for the two turns in the benchmark (individual turn 1 and 2 scores can be found in
Tables 15 and 16 in the Appendix). From the results, we can observe that
•Most quantization methods degrade the MT-Bench score for the larger models, by 5% for
Llama2-70b and 1.5% for Yi-34b (Table 3).
•The degradation in MT-Bench score is higher for the harder turn2 problem than for turn 1,
with up to 10% loss for Llama2-70b and 5% for Yi-34b (Table 16).

1) Consider a satellite that is in a circular orbit around
the Earth. The speed of the satellite decreases. What
will happen to the satellite’s orbital radius and period of
revolution? Please justify your answer using principles
of Physics.1) Only the 16-bit answer and explanation that radius
and revolution period will increase is correct, 8-bit and
4-bit answer that radius will decrease and revolution
period will increase/remain constant, respectively, and
justify their answers based on (incorrect) Physics!
2) Take your previous response and rephrase it as a
limerick.2) 16-bit is correct, 8-bit is not a limerick, 4-bit is a
limerick but unsound (uses hump and bump for phone).
3) Could you write a captivating short story beginning
with the sentence: The old abandoned house at the end of
the street held a secret that no one had ever discovered.3) 4-bit does not follow the instruction of starting the
story with the given sentence. The 16-bit story is more
realistic than the 8-bit/4-bit ones.
4) You can see a beautiful red house to your left and a
hypnotic greenhouse to your right, an attractive heated
pink place in the front. So, where is the White House?4) 16-bit is correct. 8-bit says White House is not in your
line of sight and towards your back, 4-bit says White
House is in the middle!
5) What about when twice the number is divided by 5? 5) 16-bit and 4-bit are correct, 8-bit is incorrect.
6) Reformulate your earlier reply, output it in JSON
format and only include books published after 1980.6) 16-bit and 8-bit are correct, 4-bit includes books from
1954 but not 1997!
7) Can you change the ratings from numbers to letters?
Capital letters MUST be used when writing the names
of phones.7) No model follows the Capital letters instruction. 4-bit
further messes up, changing a rating of 8.2 to B and a
rating of 8.0 to B+!
8) Given a set of complex equations, extract all unique
variable names from each equation...8) 16-bit is correct, 8-bit and 4-bit think pi is a variable
9) Rewrite your previous response. Start every sentence
with an A.9) 16-bit follows correctly, 8-bit less fluent, 4-bit is a
collection of sentences and makes the mistake of capi-
talizing the second word in every sentence!
10) What is the central dogma of molecular biology?
What processes are involved? Who named this?10) 16-bit lists four points, 8-bit reproduces the first three
of the 16-bit, 4-bit lists the first two points of the 16-bit,
indicating steady quality degradation with quantization.
•Some quantization methods do slightly better than the baseline in MT-Bench score for
smaller models but given their lower overall absolute score, we believe this variation is
likely caused by the noise in GPT4 evaluation process.
For the different compressed models, we compare them on flips in MMLU vs their difference from
baseline on MT-Bench scores in Figure 6 in the Appendix. For larger and more capable models, it is
seen that flips in MMLU correlates well with MT-Bench score. This suggests that flips is a reasonable
proxy measure for the MT-Bench score.
6.1 Qualitative evaluation
We next perform a detailed qualitative examination of the performance of these models. Specifically,
we choose the Llama2-70B-chat model since it has the highest MT-Bench score (Table 3). We
compare the 16-bit baseline against 8-bit and 4-bit models, quantized using LLM.int8(). We chose
LLM.int8() as it matches the accuracy of the baseline on most tasks and also has the highest GPT4
scores among the W8A8 and 4-bit quantized models for this task (Table 3).
We summarize our findings of the qualitative analysis for a sample of ten questions (out of ≈30 that
had similar issues) from MT-Bench in Table 4. The corresponding generated text of all three models
for these questions are provided in Table 20. Overall, we find that the 4-bit and 8-bit models are
8
significantly worse than the 16-bit baseline. Specifically, we find that the 4-bit model often does not
follow the provided instruction, makes more mistakes, and rambles a lot more , with the 8-bit model
performing in-between the 16-bit and 4-bit models.
We encourage the reader to look at the full model responses in Table 20 (at least the first one!) to
convince themselves that, at least for this task, there is significant degradation due to quantization,
despite these two compressed models matching baseline accuracy on various tasks (e.g., MMLU
accuracy within 1%) and suffering only a 0.4 lower score on a scale of ten in the GPT4 evaluation.
We believe that this qualitative analysis adds further evidence to our claim that benchmark accuracy
alone, as is standard practise today, is a poor metric to evaluate compressed LLMs, especially, if they
are likely to be used for generative tasks in downstream applications.
7 Limitations
Predicting performance degradation of LLMs in the wild is a challenging and open problem and it is
possible that anymetric calculated on standard benchmarks is insufficient. Other limitations are:
•If the downstream task is very similar to the benchmark on which the quantized model is
tested, then accuracy may be sufficient, and distance metrics are not needed.
•Flips is only a warning that the behaviour of a model and its compressed version is different
– this may or may not materialize as visible degradation in some downstream tasks.
• Our qu","The paper argues that focusing solely on accuracy when evaluating large language models (LLMs) is not enough. While accuracy is important, the authors suggest we should also consider how efficiently the models can be compressed, as well as how safe and responsible they are. Ranking LLMs by Compression is one key metric explored, which measures how much the model can be compressed without losing too much performance. Compressibility of Quantized Large Language Models is another related idea, looking at how much the models can be reduced in size while maintaining quality. Beyond just efficiency, the paper also discusses multi-dimensional safety evaluation for LLMs. This looks at factors like whether the models produce harmful or biased content, in addition to their raw accuracy. The authors conduct experiments comparing different LLMs using these broader evaluation criteria. This provides a more nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between model performance, efficiency, and safety - insights that could help guide the development of more responsible and trustworthy AI systems."

Abstract
Recent advances in AI have been significantly driven by the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems in ways that resemble human
thinking. However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which LLMs
are capable of actual reasoning . Central to this debate are two key probabilistic
concepts that are essential for connecting causes to their effects: the probability
of necessity (PN) and the probability of sufficiency (PS). This paper introduces a
framework that is both theoretical and practical, aimed at assessing how effectively
LLMs are able to replicate real-world reasoning mechanisms using these proba-
bilistic measures. By viewing LLMs as abstract machines that process information
through a natural language interface, we examine the conditions under which it is
possible to compute suitable approximations of PN and PS. Our research marks an
important step towards gaining a deeper understanding of when LLMs are capable
of reasoning, as illustrated by a series of math examples.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with technology, enabling
more natural and intuitive communication between humans and computers in applications like writing
assistants [8], sentiment analysis in social media [29], healthcare [10, 35] and many others. Despite
the surge of interest and recent breakthroughs [ 5], the ability of LLMs to reason about real-world
problems as humans do continues to be a topic of intense research [1, 14].
Reasoning is a cognitive process that involves drawing conclusions, making judgments, or forming
inferences based on facts or premises. This process has been explored from various perspectives.
Symbolic reasoning [17] involves the manipulation of symbols that represent ideas or objects and it is
often used in mathematics and logic to represent numerical values or logical propositions. Causal
reasoning [26] focuses on discerning the relationship between a cause and its effect, aiming to
understand how certain events can impact other. Other forms of reasoning include inductive reason-
ing[7] (making broad generalisations from specific observations), deductive reasoning [27] (applying
general principles to specific cases), and abductive reasoning [2] (forming the best hypothesis based
on incomplete information).
In the realm of LLMs, reasoning is typically understood to be the ability of these models to demon-
strate emergent capabilities that surpass mere statistical pattern recognition in the training set. It
entails systematically breaking down problems into a logical sequence of smaller, manageable steps
and then processing these steps internally to arrive at accurate conclusions that are grounded in reality.
This concept is the foundation for techniques such as chain of thoughts prompting [34], which aim to

Figure 1: Illustration of the actual vs. perceived reasoning abilities of GPT-2, GPT-35-turbo and GPT-
4 for a simple arithmetic problem. We posed two distinct types of questions (direct and counterfactual)
to the models, each repeated 10 times, for every {number} from 1 to 50. All three models showed
an inflated sense of reasoning capability when answering the direct questions. The discrepancy is
especially pronounced in GPT-35-turbo, which performed nearly flawlessly on direct questions, but
experienced a surge in error rate, exceeding 25%, when handling counterfactual questions.
teach LLMs how to reason by providing examples where problems are solved through a sequence of
smaller steps.
Assessing the reasoning abilities of LLMs involves distinguishing between two aspects: the accuracy
with which an LLM solves a problem, and its capacity to understand and process the fundamental
elements that lead to that solution. Judea Pearl, in his hierarchy of causality [ 25], asserts: “Only
machines that can correctly perform correlations, interventions and counterfactuals will have reason-
ing abilities comparable to human” . As demonstrated in [ 16], while LLMs are remarkable in using
learnt patterns from their training data to generate correct answers (correlations), they falter when
faced with hypothetical/imaginary scenarios that were not part of their training (counterfactuals).
This is depicted in Figure 5, which presents a straightforward arithmetic problem (this is the direct
prompt in the figure). Both GPT-35-turbo and GPT-4 can accurately determine the divisibility of
numbers by 6, suggesting at first glance that they can reason about divisibility. However, when the
questions are framed in a counterfactual manner (this is the counterfactual prompt in the figure),
only GPT-4 maintains a low error rate, indicating its superior ability to handle such reasoning tasks.
In this paper, we introduce a systematic method to assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by
examining the concepts necessity andsufficiency , which are key elements of logical reasoning and have
been studied in multiple fields such as logic, probability, and causality [ 22,19,12]. In propositional
logic, a sufficient condition is defined as X=⇒Y, indicating that the presence of Xensures the
occurrence of Y. On the other hand, a necessary condition is defined as Y=⇒X, signifying that the
occurrence of Ynecessitates the prior occurrence of X. We focus on the probabilistic interpretations
of necessity and sufficiency [ 24]. The probability of necessity (PN) between two boolean variables
XandYis defined as PN(x, y) :=P(y′
x′|x, y). Here, y′
x′represents the counterfactual value of
Y=y′, had Xbeen set to a different value x′. By conditioning on both X=xandY=y, this
measure captures probability of observing a different outcome in the absence of the event X=x.
Theprobability of sufficiency (PS), on the other hand, is defined as PS(x, y) :=P(yx|x′, y′)and
measures the probability that X=xresults in Y=y, for cases where both originally had different
values.
We show that when a problem can be solved via a reasoning graph of boolean conditions, denoted by
G, the PN and PS can be computed using a causal model underlying G. As described in [ 24], the exact
computation of PN and PS requires samples from the (causal) data generative model, counterfactual
data (experiments) as well as other monotonicity assumptions. As a reasoning test , we statistically
compare the true PN and PS measures (computed by sampling from the original and the intervened
graph) with those simulated via factual and counterfactual datasets generated by an LLM. Figure 2
presents an informal illustration of the reasoning test advocated in this paper, focusing on the specific
problem of determining whether a number Nis divisible by 6. The test relies on the reasoning
principle that: “ A natural number Nthat is divisible by both 2and3is also divisible by 6”. This
logic is represented in a reasoning graph Gthat links the conditions C2(divisibility by 2) and C3
2

corresponding reasoning graph. B)Dataset generation for computing PN and PS. C)Analysis

(divisibility by 3) to the conclusion C6(divisibility by 6). We test the reasoning abilities of an LLM
using natural numbers Nfrom 1to400. This is shown in Figure 2(A).
As indicated in Figure 2(B), we create two sets of data based on G. The first is a factual dataset
(DF) which captures whether each number Nsatisfies conditions C2andC3. The second is a
counterfactual dataset, ( DCF), which assumes condition C3is always true and then records whether
each number Xwould satisfy C6under this assumption/intervention (realised by do(C3=True )in
the figure). For the LLM being evaluated, we also produce two datasets. The first, DLLM
F , documents
the LLM’s response for C6for each number N, when the prompt is based on the reasoning graph G.
The second, DLLM
CF , involves a hypothetical scenario where we assume C3is true and then record
the LLM’s prediction for C6given this “counterfactual prompt”. This process is repeated multiple
times (several answers from the LLMs are collected from each prompt). We assess the LLM’s
reasoning capability by comparing the estimated (distribution of) PN and PS from the DLLM
F and
DLLM
CF datasets with the actual values derived from DFandDCFdatasets. Figure 2(C) displays
these comparisons, plotting PN vs. PS. The closer the estimated PN/PS values to the actual PN/PS
values, the better it is at reasoning. In this case, LLM 2 demonstrates better reasoning abilities than
LLM 1.
Related work: Reasoning in LLMs has been studied from multiple perspectives. [ 15] presents an
overview paper that elucidates key reasoning concepts utilised by LLMs. [ 13] examines the similarity
between reasoning with a language model and planning with a world model, proposing a novel
reasoning framework that redefines the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent. Various
studies [ 28,4] have focused on assessing the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of LLMs, yet
none have used the probabilities of causation as the primary objects of computation as done in our
research. [ 32] carries out a series of experiments to show that LLMs can indeed derive benefits from
reasoning errors, offering potentially cost-effective strategies by using mistakes to bolster reasoning
capabilities. Recent research indicates that LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are effective at causal
reasoning tasks, including pairwise causal discovery [18]. These models have achieved state-of-the-
art performance on multiple causal benchmarks, outperforming existing algorithms. Nevertheless,
LLMs also exhibit unpredictable failure modes, and currently, they are not capable of discovering
new knowledge or making high-stakes decisions with a high level of precision [20, 36, 21, 6, 3].

Example 1. The dotted path corresponds to the actual process of solving the problem, while the solid
path represents the one taken by the LLM.
2 LLMs as abstract machines
As described by the HEXframework [ 9], an LLM functions as an abstract machine that uses natural
language as an interface. In this section, we introduce the core elements of this framework, which
will subsequently enable us to define an LLM’s internal representation of PN and PS.
We define a problem as a query-state pair (Q, σ). The state σis a mapping defined by σ:V → C ,
which assigns values from a specified domain Cto a set of variables V={V1, . . . , V n}. The query
Q: 2V→C→2V→Cis a mapping that transforms an input state σto a well-defined output state. To
solve a problem is to calculate σ1=Q(σ0), where σ0andσ1represent the states before and after the
query Qis applied. To clarify this, we consider the following example:
Example 1. ""Given that a natural number divisible by both 2 and 3 is also divisible by 6, determine
whether the number 10 is divisible by 6.""
To solve Example 1, we apply the query Qto the state σ0={N7→10, C67→⊥} , where Q=
λσ .(σ(N) (mod 2) ≡0)∧(σ(N) (mod 3) ≡0). This results in a final state σ1={N7→
10, C67→False}, thereby resolving the problem with σ1(C6) =Q(σ0) =False .
We now turn to the question of how an LLM solves a problem defined by a query-state pair (Q, σ 0).
This process involves three essential steps as illustrated by Figure 3:
1.First, an abstraction mapping translates the initial state σ0into a latent state ˆσ0via a prompt .
2. Next, the LLM processes (via the query QLLM) this latent state ˆσ0.
3.Finally, the output mapping transforms the LLM output latent state ˆσ1back into a concrete
state, producing the final output σ1.
Formally, solving a problem (Q, σ 0)with an LLM can be described as a sequence of function
applications resulting in the output σ1= (γ◦QLLM◦α)(σ0). To illustrate this, the problem
statement is given as a prompt input to GPT-4 [ 23]. The response from GPT-4 is “False”, which
matches the result obtained by applying the query Qdirectly to the input state σ0. When both the
direct application of Qand the LLM computation yield the same answer, we say that the diagram, as
shown in Figure 3, is commutative–meaning that following either the dotted line or the solid lines
lead to the same result. For a more in-depth explanation of this framework, please refer to [9].
3 Probabilities of causation for an LLM
To assess the reasoning abilities of an LLM, we must link its generated responses to the actual
reasoning processes that produced those responses. For a problem (Q, σ), we postulate the existence
of a causal model MVdefined over variables in V, and by a set of structural equations and endogenous
variables. For a detailed introduction to causal models, refer to Appendix A. Additionally, the seminal
work by Pearl [ 25] on causality provides foundational insights on this area. Here, we are particularly
interested in causal models that represent the logical steps involved in problem-solving. However,
it is important to note that the concept of a causal model is broadly applicable beyond this specific
application.
We assume that V={X, Y, Z }, which includes XandYas boolean variables, and Zas a variable
(which may be multivariate) that encompasses all necessary factors that are required to understand
4
how an intervention on Xwould affect Y. In the context of causality, this means that the distribution
P(Y|do(X=x′)), where dodenotes the intervention operator defined in [ 25], is identifiable. This
means we can predict the outcome for Y, and that the counterfactual YX=x′, that can be read as “the
value of YhadXbeenx′”, is well-defined. For further details, please refer to Appendix A. For ease
of exposition in the following text, we will simplify our notation by omitting the explicit reference to
Z. Therefore, we will denote YX=x(Z=z)more succinctly as YX=x.
As studied in [ 31], ifYis monotonic with respect to X, then PN and PS can be computed as follows:
PN(x, y) =P(y)−P(y|do(x′))
P(x, y)andPS(x, y) =P(y|do(x))−P(y)
P(x′, y′). (1)
To estimate PN and PS, we need two different types of datasets. The first is a factual dataset
DF={xi, yi, zi}n
i=1, which is used to infer P(y),P(x, y)andP(x′, y′). The second dataset
DCF={xi, YX=xi, zi}n
i=1is acounterfactual one, and is necessary to determine P(y|do(x))and
P(y|do(x′)).
There are various methods to acquire the datasets DF(factual) and DCF(counterfactual). For a
physical process, the usual method would be through observation and experimentation. However,
in this paper, we presume access to a comprehensive reasoning graph that is equivalent to a causal
model MV. This allows us to simulate and generate the DFandDCFdatasets. Both MVand the
sub-model MV,do(X=x)define two distinct joint probability distributions PMVandPMV,do(X=x)
overX,YandZ. We obtain the datasets DFandDCFby sampling from these respective probability
distributions. These datasets are then used to calculate PS and PN using Eq. (1).
3.1 LLM-based counterfactuals
Can an LLM reason in a manner that is consistent with PMV?In Example 1, we obtained consistent
answers (that is, the corresponding HEXdiagram commutes) for a direct divisibility question.
However, to evaluate the reasoning abilities of the LLM, it is crucial that this consistency is also
observed when the queries are framed in a counterfactual manner. This is necessary to ensure that the
LLM can apply its reasoning to imaginary situations that are unlikely to be present in the training
set, demonstrating its ability to generalise based on a correct internal representation of the reasoning
logic of the problem. Practically, this means employing the LLM as a “counterfactual data simulator”,
where the data it generates under these hypothetical conditions are used to estimate PN and PS.
Definition 1 (Counterfactual query) .Consider a problem (Q, σ 0), with σ0={X7→x, Y7→y, Z7→
z}being an initial state. Let MVbe a causal model over the variables V. We can then define a
counterfactual query Q′as follows: Q′(σ0) ={X7→x′, Y7→YX=x′, Z7→z}.
In other words, a counterfactual query updates two variables of the state: it sets Xto its new value x′,
andYto the counterfactual YX=x′. An LLM-based counterfactual YLLM
X=x′is computed as follows:
YLLM
X=x′= (γ◦Q′LLM◦α)(σ0)(Y)
where σ0={X7→x, Y7→y, Z7→z}, and Q′LLMis a counterfactual query. This entire process
simulates counterfactual reasoning within the LLM, and is facilitated through textual prompts that
are structured to elicit the desired counterfactual outcome.
Definition 2 (Counterfactual prompt) .A counterfactual prompt is a textual encoding of a counterfac-
tual query for some initial state σ0.
Figure 1 shows an example of a counterfactual prompt. To create a comprehensive dataset DLLM
CF
of counterfactuals based on an LLM, we start with the factual dataset DLLM
F . From this dataset,
we generate a set of initial states σ0,i={X7→xi, Y7→yi, Z7→zi}, which serve as the basis for
deriving counterfactuals using the LLM. To compute PN and PS, we substitute DFwithDLLM
F and
DCFwithDLLM
CF in Eq. (1).
Example 1 revisited . We construct four distinct datasets using every integer in [1,400]: the factual
dataset DF, the counterfactual dataset DCF, the LLM-based factual dataset DLLM
F , and the LLM-
based counterfactual dataset DLLM
CF . These datasets, shown in Figure 4 ( Left) are generated following
the causal model shown in Figure 2, its modified version with interventions, and the LLM prompting
methods mentioned previously. We obtain PN= 1 andPS= 0.50for the datasets DFandDCF.
On the other hand, PNGPT−4= 0.984andPSGPT−4= 0.505, when we use the factual DLLM
F and
counterfactual DLLM
CF datasets generated by GPT-4.

for each element of the problem across 10 replicated tests. Right : Sensitivity of the simulated PN

3.2 Counterfactual consistency in LLMs
Definition 3 (β-counterfactual consistency) .Consider a structural causal model MVwith vari-
ablesV={X, Y, Z }. Let AX=x(Z)be a function that generates counterfactuals for Y.
We say that Aisβ-counterfactual consistent with MVif the following condition is satisfied:
EP(X,Y,Z )[AX=x(Z=z)̸=YX=x(Z=z)]≤β, where β≤0.
β-counterfactual consistency defines the limit error rate for counterfactuals produced by AX=x(Z=
z). This error rate should ideally be zero for an LLM that exhibits flawless reasoning abilities. The
following lemma specifies the conditions necessary for this property to hold (the proof can be found
in Appendix D).
Lemma 1. LetMV, with variables V={X, Y, Z }, be a structural causal model for a problem
(Q, σ 0), and let Mbe an LLM that generates counterfactuals for Y. Then Misβ-counterfactual
consistent with MVif and only if its associated HEXdiagram for the problem (Q′, σ0), where Q′is
the counterfactual version of Q, is commutative for all admissible values of X,YandZ.
4 Empirical illustrations
We focus on three math problems, each with a progressively higher level of difficulty.
Divisibility by 6 (Div6 ): We compute the PN and PS to determine the impact that an integer N’s
divisibility by 3(denoted as C3) has on its divisibility by 6(denoted as C6). For our analysis, we
consider N∈[1,400].
Even sum of integers (EvenSum ): We examine scenarios where the sum of three integers M,Nand
Tis even. This can occur under two conditions: when all three integers are even, or when one is even
and the other two are odd. We evaluate PN and PS for impact that Mbeing odd or even ( Cm) has on

densities of the estimated probabilities capture the uncertainty associated with the responses by each
model.
the resulting sum being odd or even ( Cmnt). For our analysis, we consider all possible values for M,
NandT, with each integer ranging from 1and8.
Candy party (CandyParty ): In this hypothetical scenario, Rafa is having his birthday party with two
guests, Lara and Emma. They have 20candies to distribute among themselves. The party will be
considered ‘happy’ if the candy distribution satisfies at least one of the following conditions: (i) Each
person gets the same number of candies, or (ii) Rafa gets more candies than both Lara and Emma,
but Lara and Emma each receive an equal number of candies, with both receiving at least one candy
each. We compute the PN and PS for the impact that Lara and Emma receiving an equal number of
candies (denoted as Clm) has on the party being ‘happy’ (denoted as Ch).
A fourth problem ( ConPref ) is included in Appendix B. The reasoning graphs for the problems
EvenSum andCandyParty are shown in Figure 4 ( Right ). The structural equations corresponding
to each of these graphs can be found in the Appendix C. We estimate the PN and PS for each of
these problems using three difference language models: GPT-2, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 [ 23]. Our
objective is to investigate whether the ability to reason, as conceptualised in this paper, emerges as
the complexity and size of the models grow. While similar evaluations could be conducted using
other families of LLMs, such as Llama [ 33], Gemini [ 30], Phi [ 11], etc., we have chosen to limit our
analysis to the GPT series for the sake of a clearer and more straightforward exposition.
To assess the reasoning abilities of various models, we use the following metrics:
1.Factual Inconsistency Rate (FIR): This measures the rate of inconsistencies when the models
respond to factual queries.
2.Counterfactual Inconsistency Rate (CIR): Similar to FIR, but this metric measures inconsis-
tencies in responses to counterfactual queries.
For a detailed explanation of these metrics, please refer to Appendix H. We estimate the standard
errors of FIR and CIR by examining the variations in outputs across multiple model responses.
Additionally, we capitalise on this variability to construct the densities over the inferred PN and PS.
This process involves generating 500bootstrap samples from the model’s factual and counterfactual
responses1. From these densities, we calculate γ-PN-overlap, which measures the concentration of
the probability distribution within a radius γaround the actual PN, and γ-PS-overlap does the same
for PS2.
4.1 Factual vs. counterfactual predictions
Figure 5 ( Left) illustrates the alignment between the outputs of GPT-2, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4,
and the factual predictions and counterfactuals for the Div6 problem. The shading within each cell
1Note that while generating a larger number of model answers could potentially increase accuracy, the
computational costs are prohibitive. Therefore, the bootstrap approach serves as a reasonable compromise.

if this work is accepted for publication.

GPT-35-turbo and GPT-4. Ideal reasoning is achieved when the overlap is one for all values of γ.

by a×).
of the heatmap indicates the degree of mismatch between model-generated outputs and the true
information, with the colour intensity reflecting the level of disagreement based on the 10answers
from the models. As highlighted in Figure1—where the average disagreement across the first 100
columns of these heatmaps informs the results—more sophisticated models like GPT-4 demonstrate a
closer match with the counterfactuals derived from the true reasoning graph. For similar comparisons
involving other problems, please refer to Appendix I.
One might wonder if the evaluation of reasoning truly requires PN and PS, or if it could be sufficiently
assessed by examining only the inconsistency rates in factual/counterfactual data. Figure 5 ( Right )
underscores the importance of PN and PS. It presents the estimated distributions of PN for the Div6
problem, based on 500 replicates under five scenarios where true counterfactuals are randomly altered
with probabilities 0.005,0.001,0.05,0.1and0.2. As we might anticipate, the greater the deviation
from a dataset free of counterfactual errors, the more significant the discrepancy from the actual
PN= 1 for this example. Notably, even minor perturbations can lead to substantial shifts in the
estimated PN. For example, with a 0.05probability of counterfactual perturbation, the estimated PN
varies between 0.5 and 0.9. This suggests that relying solely on counterfactual errors could lead to an
overestimation of the models’ reasoning abilities, particularly their understanding of the necessary
and sufficient conditions within a problem. Furthermore, a counterfactual error rate of 0.2in this
example results in entirely inconsistent (negative) probabilities due to the mismatch between the
conditional and interventional distributions, as defined in Eq. 1.
4.2 Evaluation LLMs reasoning
We computed the CIR, FIR, γ-PN-overlap, and γ-PS-overlap for the problems Div6 ,EvenSum and
CandyParty using GPT-2, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4.
Figure 6 illustrates the estimated PN and PS for each problem, obtained through bootstrap resampling.
Each density is labeled with the model that was used used to generate such densities. The true values
of the PS and PN in each problem is marked with a cross. A model is considered capable of reasoning
8
if the PN-PS density estimates overlap with the true probabilities of causation. Such an overlap was
only achieved by GPT-4 for Div6 problem. Other results varied, indicating generally weak reasoning
abilities. Negative values of PN and PS in several instances, are due to inconsistencies in DLLM
F and
DLLM
CF as detailed in Section 4.1.
Figure 7 ( Left,Centre ) features the γ-PN-overlap and γ-PN-overlap curves for all models and
problems, where ideal reasoning corresponds to the metrics equalling one for any value of γ. GPT-
4 shows this level of reasoning for the Div6 problem. However, GPT-2 had an accurate PN for
Even-Sum , but the PS estimates were notably less accurate.
Figure 7 ( Right ) presents the values of CIR and PIR (with the standard deviations included brackets).
An emerging trend towards reasoning is observed in the GPT family of models, particularly seen with
GPT-4 for the Div6 problem. An intriguing question is whether future versions of these models will
similarly approach the true PN and PS for other problems as well.
5 Discussion
The primary objective of this paper was to explore and understand the reasoning abilities of LLMs,
which is essential for their successful deployment in a range of applications. Given the growing
dependence on LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, programming, or strategic
planning, understanding this is crucial. To evaluate these reasoning abilities, we introduced a novel
framework that employs probabilistic measures of necessity and sufficiency, and find that while
various models (GPT-2, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4) can replicate aspects of reasoning to some
degree, they often falter when it comes to counterfactual reasoning. Notably, the ability to reason,
as defined in this paper, does improve with more complex models, yet it is still far from flawless.
This observation leads to the question of whether future versions of these models will achieve perfect
reasoning. Our results are significant, as they reveal the limitations of LLMs, and emphasize the need
for further research to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
Limitations : Our approach has several limitations that we acknowledge, but did not address within
the scope of this research.
1.Dependence on causal reasoning graphs : our method requires access to causal reasoning
graphs. This requirement may hinder our ability to fully understand the reasoning abilities
of LLMs in situations where it is challenging to derive causal relationships.
2.Boolean variable restriction : our method is designed to work with boolean valued variables,
which is restrictive, particularly for cases involving multiple states or conditions occurring
at the same time. However, we believe that this issue can be addresss with further research.
3.Prompt-dependent results : The findings we report are based on an LLM’s reasoning abilities
as determined by two specific types (factual/counterfacutal) of prompts that we used. Our
experiments did not aim to fine-tune these prompts or to ’optimise reasoning’—a separate
area of ongoing research. Instead, our goal was to offer valuable insights that can aid the
community in developing new benchmarks and employing LLMs responsibly.
Broader impact : Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential as it significantly
influences their effectiveness in various domains. In education and research, it is important for the
model to be able to provide accurate explanations and to formulate meaningful hypotheses. In the
commercial sector, the effectiveness of automated processes/systems relies heavily on how well
the model can reason. When it comes to accessibility, the model must be able to understand and
meet dive","The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) - powerful AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data - are capable of reasoning and understanding causal relationships. LLMs can generate human-like text, but it's not clear if they truly comprehend the underlying meanings and causal connections, or if they are simply pattern-matching based on statistical correlations in the data. The researchers approach this question by treating LLMs as abstract machines - mathematical models that can perform computations and transformations on inputs to produce outputs. They examine the ""probabilities of causation"" within these models, looking for signs that the LLMs are going beyond simple association and grasping deeper causal relationships. The plain English explanation covers the core ideas and significance of this research in an accessible way, using analogies and examples to make the technical concepts more understandable for a general audience."

Abstract —Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as
powerful tools for natural language processing tasks, revolutioniz-
ing the field with their ability to understand and generate human-
like text. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
the several research efforts that have been presented for the
acceleration of transformer networks for Large Language Models
using hardware accelerators. The survey presents the frameworks
that have been proposed and then performs a qualitative and
quantitative comparison regarding the technology, the processing
platform (FPGA, ASIC, In-Memory, GPU), the speedup, the
energy efficiency, the performance (GOPs), and the energy
efficiency (GOPs/W) of each framework. The main challenge in
comparison is that every proposed scheme is implemented on
a different process technology making hard a fair comparison.
The main contribution of this paper is that we extrapolate the
results of the performance and the energy efficiency on the same
technology to make a fair comparison; one theoretical and one
more practical. We implement part of the LLMs on several FPGA
chips to extrapolate the results to the same process technology
and then we make a fair comparison of the performance.

large language models
I. I NTRODUCTION
Modeling human language on a large scale is a complex
process that has taken decades to develop. It started in 1950
with Claude Shannon, who applied information theory to
human language. Since then, tasks like translation and speech
recognition have advanced significantly.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are
key to this progress. ML, a subset of AI, allows computers
to learn from data. ML models are either supervised (making
predictions) or unsupervised. This thesis focuses on supervised
models, which predict and compare values to minimize error
through optimization.
Deep Learning models are divided into Generative (creating
new data) and Discriminative (distinguishing data types). Gen-
erative AI, a subset of deep learning, uses neural networks to
process labeled and unlabeled data. Large Language Models
(LLMs) help understand characters, words, and texts.
In 2017, transformers revolutionized language modeling.
Transformers, a type of neural network, handle long-term text
dependencies using an attention mechanism. Google created
the first transformer model for text translation in 2017. Trans-formers have since evolved, improving attention mechanisms
and architectures.
ChatGPT, a notable LLM, predicts text continuations and
performs tasks like answering questions, summarizing texts,
and more. It uses probability distributions to generate various
text forms based on user requests.
A. LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensive, general-
purpose models that can be pre-trained and adapted for specific
tasks. They solve common language problems such as text
classification, question answering, summarization, and text
generation in various domains.
LLMs are ”general-purpose” because they handle diverse
tasks and ”large” due to their massive training datasets and
numerous parameters. These models have multiple neural
network layers with adjustable weights that learn to predict
the next word in a sentence during training.
The number of parameters indicates the model’s complexity
and capacity. Weights, adjusted during training, connect neu-
rons in different layers, influencing the model’s performance.
Transformers, a type of LLM, consist of an encoder and
a decoder. The encoder has six layers, each with Multi-Head
Self-Attention and a feed-forward network. The decoder has
six layers, including an additional multi-head attention layer
over the encoder’s output.
The attention mechanism maps queries and key-value pairs
to outputs, with positional encoding adding information about
character positions. This architecture enables transformers to
handle long-term dependencies in text effectively
B. Encoder-Decoder
The encoder-decoder architecture is central to Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) and designed to process and generate
sequences. This architecture has two stages:
•Encoder: The input (e.g., natural language) is trans-
formed into a vector representation that encapsulates the
meaning of the input.
•Decoder: The decoder takes this vector representation
and generates an output sequence, such as a translation
into another language.arXiv:2409.03384v1 [cs.AR] 5 Sep 2024
C. Attention Mechanism
The Attention Mechanism is vital in modern machine learn-
ing, especially in transformers, improving sequence processing
tasks like translation and text generation. It connects both
the encoder and decoder stages. The Attention Mechanism
includes two further mechanisms: Multi-Head Attention and
Self-Attention. The former focuses attention on different parts
of the input simultaneously, allowing the model to recognize
complex patterns and relationships in the input data. The
latter captures dependencies and relationships between tokens
regardless of their distance. It uses three matrices: Query (Q),
Key (K), and Value (V). These matrices determine how much
attention each token should give to another, enhancing the
quality of translations and other sequence-based tasks.
D. Related work
Until now there is not any comprehensive survey on the
hardware accelerators to speed-up the most computational
intensive tasks of Transformers. In [1], a survey has presented
a survey on the hardware acceleration of transformer networks
for autonomous driving. The paper presents several efforts
on the acceleration of tasks such as object detection, 3D
segmentation, and lane detection.
In 2022, Huang et al. presented a survey on hardware accel-
eration for transformers [2]. The paper was mostly focused on
the the transformer model compression algorithm based on the
hardware accelerator and was limited mostly on FPGA-based
implementation.
In 2023, Emani et al [3] presented a comprehensive per-
formance study of LLMs on several computing platforms and
evaluated their performance characteristics for these models.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the
several research efforts that have been presented for the accel-
eration of transformer networks for Large Language models
and NLP using hardware accelerators. The survey presents the
frameworks that have been proposed and then performs a qual-
itative and quantitative comparison regarding the technology,
the processing platform (GPU, FPGA, ASIC, In-Memory), the
performance, and the energy efficiency of each framework.
First, we present the accelerators based on FPGAs, then we
present the accelerators targeting GPUs and finally accelerators
ported on ASICs and In-memory architectures.
The main contributions of this papers are the followings:
•An extensive survey of hardware acceleration of LLM
using FPGA, ASICs, In-memory architectures and GPUs.
•A comparison in terms of performance (GOPs), energy
efficiency (GOPs/W) and speedup.
•An extrapolation of the features to the same technology
for a fair comparison in terms of performance and energy
efficiency.
II. FPGA- BASED ACCELERATORS
A. FTRANS
In 2020, Li et al [4] presented a hardware acceleration
framework, called FTRANS, that was targeting the accelera-
tion of transformer-based large scale language representations.It focuses on compression and acceleration to address comput-
ing and storage requirements, achieving up to 16 times com-
pression with minimal accuracy loss through a Block Circulant
Matrix (BCM) based weight model. The model significantly
improves speed and energy efficiency, surpassing CPU and
GPU implementations, with a comparison showing FTRANS
is 81x faster and 9x more energy-efficient than alternatives,
specifically compared to the GPU processor RTX5000 using
VCU118 (16nm). The accelerator achieves a performance rate
of 170 GOPs and an energy efficiency rate of 6.8 GOPs/W.
B. Multi-Head Attention
In 2020, Lu et al. presented an FPGA based architecture for
the acceleration of the most computationally intensive parts of
transformer networks [5]. In their work they propose a novel
hardware accelerator for two key components, i.e., the multi-
head attention (MHA) ResBlock and the position-wise feed-
forward network (FFN) ResBlock, which are the two most
complex layers in the Transformer.
The proposed framework is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.
Based on the performance evaluation the proposed design
achieves a speed-up of 14.6× compared to a V100 GPU.
C. FPGA NPE
In 2021, Khan et al. presented an FPGA acceleration
for language models called NPE. [6]. The NPE architecture
consists of an instruction control unit (ICU), a memory read
unit (MRU), a memory write unit (MWU), a matrix multiply
unit (MMU), and a nonlinear vector unit (NVU).
NPE was implemented on Xilinx Zynq Z-7100 FPGA board
clocked at 200 MHz. NPE is compared with other frame-
works like FTRANS and implementation on CPU and GPU.
Although that there is not any significant speedup compared to
other computing platforms, the main advantage is the energy
efficiency. NPE achieves around 4× better energy efficiency
over CPU (i7-8700k) and 6× over GPU (RTX 5000).
D. Column Balanced Block Pruning
In 2021, Peng et al. presented a novel scheme on accel-
erating Transformer networks using column balanced block-
wise pruning [7]. The column balanced block-wise pruning
combines the key features of both bank balanced pruning and
block-wise pruning. The column balanced block-wise pruning
ranks the blocks’ L2 norm by each column to get the pruning
thresholds and prunes blocks for each column.
The proposed framework has been implemented on different
hardware platforms (Intel i5-5257U (2.7 GHZ) CPU, Nvidia
Jetson TX2 GPU, and Xilinx Alveo U200 FPGA) for further
comparison of latency and throughput. The experimental re-
sults showed that the FPGA platform achieves a 11× speed up
compared to the CPU platform and 2× speed up compared to
the GPU platform.
E. Compressed Block Row
In 2021, Panjie Qi et al, presented an acceleration frame-
work that combines balanced model compression at the algo-
rithm level with an FPGA implementation optimization at the
hardware level [8]. In their work, they propose an effective
sparse matrix storage structure for block-balanced pruning,
known as Compressed Block Row (CBR), and their hardware
design includes an accelerator for sparse models. Moreover,
they present a performance analytic methodology for evalu-
ating accelerator performance. The experiments demonstrate
that their CBR format outperforms conventional formats and
saves substantial storage space.
The proposed framework is implemented on a Xilinx ALveo
U200 FPGA. Based on the performance evaluation the pro-
posed design achieves a speed-up of 38x compared to a Nvidia
Guardo RTX 6000.
F . ViA
In 2022, Teng Wang et al, presented ViA [9], an FPGA-
based accelerator architecture for Vision Transformers (ViT),
featuring a memory recognition unit, a memory write unit,
and processing elements like the NSA self-attention module
and MLP. It proposes data partitioning strategies to enhance
efficiency and reduce dependency. ViA’s FPGA implemen-
tation significantly outperforms CPUs, GPUs, and previous
FPGA accelerators, achieving 60x the speed and 5x the energy
efficiency of alternatives like the Nvidia Tesla V100 and Alveo
U50 (16nm). ViA reaches an acceleration rate of 309.6 GOPs
and an energy efficiency rate of 7.9 GOPs/W.
G. FPGA DFX
In 2022, Hong et al. presented DFX [10] for the acceleration
of the transformer networks used in LLMs. Similarly to
NPE, the DFX architecture proposed a modular architecture
consisting for several computer core for the acceleration of the
transformer networks.
For the evaluation, DFX has been implemented on an Intel
Xeon Gold 6226R CPU with four Xilinx Alveo U280 data
center acceleration cards. DFX achieves an average of 3.8x
throughput and 4x higher energy efficiency compared to the
GPU appliances.
H. STA
In 2022, Chao Fang et al, presented the Sparse Transformer
Accelerator (STA) on FPGA to address the high computational
demands of transformer models [11]. Utilizing an N struc-
ture, the STA minimizes operations and memory size while
enhancing performance. The design includes a unified matrix
multiplication mechanism, a Softmax module, and a Dense
Matrix Multiplication Engine (DMME), implemented on an
Intel Arria 10 SX660 device. It significantly improves energy
efficiency and reduces latency compared to previous FPGA
methods.
The STA is divided into STA-4 and STA-8 subcategories.
STA-4 achieves 6.7 times better performance and is 10 times
more energy-efficient than other models, with an acceleration
rate of 392.8 GOPs and energy efficiency of 33.6 GOPs/W,
using Nvidia RTX 2080Ti for comparison. STA-8, while
slightly less performant with 4.4x better performance, offers
12.3x better energy efficiency, achieving an acceleration rate
of 523.8 GOPs and energy efficiency of 41.2 GOPs/W.I. FPGA OPU
In 2023, Bai et al. proposed another scheme for the ac-
celeration of transformer networks called Overaly OPU [12].
They propose a configurable computation unit to support
the inference of diverse networks. Specifically, they propose
48 processing elements (PEs) that are configured for the
acceleration of the transformer networks. The output stage of
the adder tree can be switched during the inference process.
That way, data from forwarding modules can flow through
the computation unit in a pre-defined connection state. The
proposed scheme achieves 5x-15× speedup compared with a
CPU, 1.1-2.9× speedup compared with GPU (RTX 3090), and,
1.10-2.5× speedup compared with the other FPGA accelerators
such as NPE [6].
J. FPGA acceleration of Transformer networks
In 2022, Tzanos et al, presented a high-performance hard-
ware accelerator for the transformer networks [13]. Trans-
former networks use a technique called attention. The atten-
tion, adopted by the field of neuroscience, is the ability to be
able to selectively concentrate on specific data while ignoring
other data of the environment. In deep learning we imitate
this technique through attention mechanisms and one way to
achieve this is to encode a sequence not into a single fixed
vector but to create a model that produces a vector for each
output step by adding a set of weights which will later be
optimized.
The performance evaluation showed that the proposed
framework can achieve 2.3x system speedup for the BERT
model compared to a 40-thread processor and 80.5x speed-up
over a single-core CPU.
K. FlexRun
In 2023, Hur at al. presented an FPGA-based accelerator to
speedup the diverse and complex NLP models, called FlexRun
[14]. The paper is focused on accelerating both Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) models such as SRNN or long short
term memory (LSTM) and attention-based NLP models, such
as Transformer, and GPT2.
For evaluation, they compare FlexRun with Intel’s
Brainwave-like architecture on a Stratix-10 GX FPGA and a
Tesla V100 GPU with tensor cores enabled. Compared to the
FPGA baseline, FlexRun achieves an average speedup of 1.59×
on various configurations of BERT. For GPT2, FlexRun gets
1.31× average speedup. Next, when comparing to the GPU
implementation, FlexRun improves the performance by 2.79×
and 2.59× for BERT and GPT2, respectively.
L. HPTA
In 2023, Yuntao Han and Qiang Liu presented the High-
Performance Transformer Accelerator (HPTA) [15], leverag-
ing a custom multiplication matrix, adder tree, and memory
subsystem. It can handle various types of transformers used
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision
(CV). The performance of HPTA was evaluated against CPU,
GPU, and other FPGA implementations. The results showed
significant improvements in speed and energy efficiency for
both BERT and Swin Transformer models. Compared to CPU
and GPU, HPTA processed BERT up to 44x faster and 175x
more energy-efficiently. It was also 1.8x faster than previous
FPGA accelerators
M. Swin
In 2023, Zhiyang Liu, Zhenhua Ren, and Pengyu Yin de-
veloped an accelerator for the Swin Transformer in computer
vision tasks, addressing hardware acceleration challenges with
large images [16]. The architecture includes computation units
for GELU and Softmax, allowing Swin Transformer Block
execution in one cycle and improving efficiency by replacing
Layer Normalization (LN) with Batch Normalization (BN). It
offers significant speed and energy efficiency improvements
over CPU and GPU. The accelerator is categorized into Swin-
T, Swin-S, and Swin-B. Swin-T is 1.8x faster and 20.5x more
energy-efficient, Swin-S is 1.7x faster and 18.6x more energy-
efficient, and Swin-B is 4.4x faster and 14.6x more energy-
efficient compared to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti. The
acceleration rates are 431.2, 403.5, and 436.4 GOPs for Swin-
T, Swin-B, and Swin-S, respectively.
N. Zhongyo Zhao
In 2023, Zhongyo Zhao presented an accelerator that uses
an Output Block Storing (OBS) data handling method to
efficiently execute transformer models for object recognition
[17]. The proposed method involves dividing the inputs and
allocating weights into small block matrices to reduce memory
access for input data and weights. Additionally, the OBS
data flow maintains usage rates by collecting partial sums,
while slightly reducing them compared to the output block
data flow. This results in improved overall energy efficiency.
The accelerator implements this data flow and achieves a
processing rate of 728.3 GOPs and an energy efficiency of
58.31 GOPs/W, surpassing previous CNN-based accelerators.
This study used a Xilinx VC709 processor for comparison and
employed Virtex™ 7VC707 (28nm) technology.
O. ODE-based acceleration
In 2024, a hybrid approach was proposed for the acceler-
ation of the transformer networks by Okubo et al [18]. The
proposed scheme uses ResNet as a backbone architecture and
replaces a part of its convolution layers with an MHSA (Multi-
Head Self-Attention) mechanism. Using this approach they
manage to significantly reduce the parameter size of such
models by using Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation)
as a backbone architecture instead of ResNet. The proposed
hybrid model reduces the parameter size by 94.6% compared
to the CNN-based ones without degrading the accuracy.
The performance evaluation on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+
MPSoC platform shows that the proposed FPGA implemen-
tation achieves 12.8× speedup and 9.2× energy efficiency
compared to an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU implementation.P . Beta
In 2024, Yuhao Ji presented a Binary Transformer Acceler-
ator (BETA) that achieves high performance and flexibility
[19]. This is accomplished through a computational flow
subtraction method aimed at optimizing QMMs. The QMM
is a programmable machine that can support a wide range
of precision while providing high parallelism, speed, and
energy efficiency. Various experiments compared BETA with
previous FPGA accelerators, concluding that energy efficiency
continuously improves. While performance speed compared to
other CPUs and GPUs is not mentioned, the energy efficiency
is reported to be 22x better. The study used the RTX3090
and ZCU102 (16nm) technology, with BETA achieving an
acceleration rate and energy efficiency rate of 1436 GOPs and
174 GOPs/W, respectively.
Q. Me-Vit
In 2024, Kyle Marino, Pengmiao Zhang, and Viktor K.
Prasanna introduced Me-ViT [20], a memory-efficient Vision
Transformer design that outperforms traditional ViT accel-
erators on FPGA in speed and energy efficiency. Me-ViT
combines Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron blocks,
reducing data transfers and intermediate writes by loading
weights only once. Its Memory-Efficient Processing Element
(ME-PE) minimizes data movement and computation in-
terruptions. Using systolic arrays for matrix multiplication,
Me-ViT optimizes memory access, providing scalable, high-
performance solutions for vision tasks on FPGA. Compared to
CPUs and GPUs, Me-ViT is 5.1x faster and 4x more energy-
efficient, achieving an acceleration rate of 2,682 GOPs. The
study uses Nvidia TITAN RTX GPU and Alveo U200 (16nm)
technology for comparison
R. TransAxx
In 2024, Dimitrios Danopoulos, Georgios Zervakis, and
Dimitrios Soudris introduced TransAxx [21], a framework
aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Vision Transformer
(ViT) models through approximation computing. It includes
a PyTorch-based system that supports continuous approxima-
tion computing and assesses its effects on ViT models. The
technique involves studying the sensitivity of transformers to
approximate multipliers, fine-tuning for accuracy, and using
the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to create
approximate accelerators. Key techniques for accuracy im-
provement include quantization, pre-calibration training, and
adaptive retraining. The framework reduces computational
complexity and memory demands while balancing speed and
energy efficiency. TransAxx provides a comprehensive ap-
proach for optimizing ViT models, enabling professionals to
improve performance with limited resources through methods
like quantization, calibration, and retraining.
S. Ikumo Okubo
In 2024, Ikumi Okubo introduced a cost-effective FPGA
implementation of the Tiny Transformer model utilizing a
Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) tech-
nique [22]. This method uses fewer parameters and less
memory compared to ResNet-based deep models, making it
suitable for resource-constrained devices. The model features
ODEBlocks that reuse parameters, a learned relative positional
encoding, and quantization to n-bit integers using LLTs. It
also incorporates Depth-wise Separable Convolution (DSC)
and Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), forming a hybrid
architecture. This approach is highly memory-efficient and
significantly improves speed and energy efficiency, being
12.8x faster and 9.2x more energy-efficient than other models,
and is compared to the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU using ZCU102
(16nm) technology.
T. SSR
In 2024, Jinming Zhuang presented SSR [23] as a unique
architecture emphasizing the balance between latency and
performance in accelerating transformers. It employs various
elements such as FPGA and examines the trade-off between
latency and performance for different models, achieving per-
formance and energy efficiency increases. The method used is
matrix multiplication, which controls the data communication
between accelerators and seeks ways to improve performance.
SSR provides open-source tools for reproducing results and
can optimize communication between accelerators, reducing
data transmission costs. Compared to other CPUs and GPUs,
SSR is approximately 36x faster and 21x more energy-efficient
than previous accelerators. This study utilizes the Nvidia
A10G GPU and VCK190 (7nm) technology.
III. CPU AND GPU- BASED ACCELERATORS
A. TurboTransformer
In 2021, Jiarui Fang and Yang Yu introduced the Turbo-
Transformers accelerator [24], a technique for efficiently serv-
ing Transformer models on GPUs for variable-length inputs.
They addressed the challenges of padding smaller sequences
to match the length of the longest sequence in a batch. By
using dynamic programming to solve the optimization issue,
they increased the response rate by 35 % compared to not
using batching.
To reduce memory size, TurboTransformers introduces a
variable-length allocator that employs a segment-based mem-
ory management technique and a space reuse mechanism in
the computation graph, reducing memory usage by 50 per cent
compared to a reference allocator. Testing the system with
various Transformer models, including BERT and Albert, the
authors found that TurboTransformers outperformed PyTorch
and ONNXRuntime in latency and performance for variable-
length inputs, being 2.8x faster
B. Jaewan Choi
In 2022, researcher Jaewan Choi presented the study titled
”Accelerating Transformer Networks through Rewiring of
Softmax Layers” [25], which provides a method to accelerate
the Softmax layer in transformer networks. The research
introduces a rewiring technique to speed up the Softmaxlayer in transformer networks, which has become increasingly
important as transformer models process longer sequences to
improve accuracy rates. The proposed technique divides the
Softmax layer into several sub-layers, changes the data access
pattern, and then merges the disassembled Softmax sub-layers
with the subsequent and preceding processes. This method
accelerates the inference of BERT, GPT-Neo, BigBird, and
Longformer on a current GPU by up to 1.25x, 1.12x, 1.57x,
and 1.65x respectively, significantly reducing off-chip memory
traffic.
C. SoftMax
In 2022, Choi et al. presented a novel framework for acceler-
ation of transformer networks through Recomposing Softmax
Layers [26]. The softmax layer normalizes the elements of the
attention matrix to values between 0 and 1. This operation
is conducted along the row vector of the attention matrix.
Based on the profiling, the softmax layer in the scaled dot-
product attention (SDA) block uses 36%, 18%, 40%, and 42%
of the total execution time of BERT, GPT-Neo, BigBird, and
Longformer, respectively.
Softmax recomposition achieves up to 1.25×, 1.12×, 1.57×,
and 1.65× speedups in inferring BERT, GPT-Neo, BigBird,
and Longformer on a A100 GPU by significantly reducing
the off-chip memory traffic.
D. LightSeq2
In 2022, Wang et al. proposed a series of GPU optimizations
to accelerate the training for a general family of Transformer
models on GPUs called LightSeq2 [27].
LightSeq2 proposes 3 techniques for the acceleration of
the training of transformer networks. Firstly, to all types of
transformers, LightSeq2 uses fused kernel operators for both
encoder and decoder layers. Adjacent fine-grained element-
wise kernels are fused into one coarse-grained kernel, resulting
in fewer kernel launches and intermediate results. For example,
the last kernel of the self-attention layer implements bias
adding, dropout, and residual kernels with only one kernel
launch.
The performance evaluation shows that LightSeq2 is con-
sistently faster (1.4-3.5×) than previous systems on different
GPUs and it can achieve up to 3x speedup on large public
datasets.
E. Simplified Transformer Networks
In 2023, He and Hofmann [28] have also proposed a novel
framework to accelerate transformer networks in GPUs by
simplified transformers without compromising convergence
properties and downstream task performance.
Based on the performance evaluation both on autoregressive
decoder-only and BERT encoder-only models, the simplified
transformers emulate the per-update training speed and per-
formance of standard transformers, while enjoying 15% faster
training throughput in GPUs, and using 15% fewer parameters.
F . LLMA
In 2023, Nan Yang introduced LLMA [29], an accelerator
for large language models (LLMs) that enhances inference
speed through interaction with reference data. This method
uses a reference-based decoding mechanism to select and
process tokens efficiently, enabling parallel execution on GPUs
without needing new models. LLMA is easy to implement and
deploy, providing over twice the speed for various model sizes
using the Nvidia 32G V100 GPU.
G. FlexGen
In 2023, researchers introduced FlexGen, a high-throughput
system for generating large language models (LLMs) designed
for latency processing in resource-limited environments. Flex-
Gen generates 32 tokens per prompt and evaluates throughput
by the number of tokens generated divided by adaptation
and decoding time. Compared to DeepSpeed ZeRO-Inference
and Hugging Face Accelerate, FlexGen provides 40x more
throughput with the same latency using an Nvidia T4 (16GB)
GPU. Built on PyTorch, FlexGen utilizes multiple CUDA
streams and CPU threads for I/O combination, significantly
increasing performance through CPU computation and result
overlapping.
H. vLLMs
In 2023, researchers introduced the vLLMs model to ad-
dress efficient memory management for large language models
(LLMs), which have high memory requirements [30]. They
proposed a strategy called PagedAttention, which divides key-
value attention into fixed-size blocks and uses paging to
maintain them. This approach enhances memory efficiency and
reduces the memory footprint of LLMs. The vLLM architec-
ture leverages PagedAttention to manage memory effectively,
particularly in beam search scenarios with a fixed number of
candidates. The model supports mixed decoding approaches
with various sharing and memory access patterns, using a
mapping layer to convert logical blocks to physical blocks,
further optimizing memory usage and reducing the overall
memory footprint of LLMs.
I. Alisa
In 2024, researchers introduced the ALISA model [31],
aimed at accelerating large language models (LLMs) through
sparse window attention (SWA) and dynamic scheduling. This
approach addresses the limitations of existing optimizations
in maintaining competitive accuracy. SWA creates sparse
patterns that are both locally static and globally dynamic,
preserving the sequential semantics of language while cap-
turing its dynamic evolution. Dynamic scheduling further
enhances performance by balancing memory access and token
processing. By integrating SWA, dynamic scheduling, and
KV compression, ALISA significantly reduces the memory
footprint of KV stores. The study demonstrates that ALISA
outperforms previous methods in accuracy and performance,
with comparisons across three families of open-source LLM
models.IV. ASIC A CCELERATORS
A. A3
One of the early research on the acceleration of transformer
networks was proposed in 2020 by Hma et al. called A3
[32]. The paper proposes a hardw","Large language models are powerful AI systems that can understand and generate human-like text. However, training and running these models on standard computer hardware can be extremely computationally intensive and time-consuming. Hardware acceleration refers to the use of specialized chips or circuits to offload and speed up the computations required for LLMs. This can involve things like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are optimized for the particular math operations and data patterns used in LLMs. By leveraging these hardware acceleration techniques, researchers and companies can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of their LLM systems. This could enable faster model training, lower inference latency, and reduced energy consumption - all of which are crucial for real-world LLM applications."

Abstract
Despite their nearly universal adoption for large language
models, the internal workings of transformers are not well
understood. We aim to better understand the impact of re-
moving or reorganizing information throughout the layers of
a pretrained transformer. Such an understanding could both
yield better usage of existing models as well as to make archi-
tectural improvements to produce new variants. We present a
series of empirical studies on frozen models that show that the
lower and final layers of pretrained transformers differ from
middle layers, but that middle layers have a surprising amount
of uniformity. We further show that some classes of problems
have robustness to skipping layers, running the layers in an
order different from how they were trained, or running the
layers in parallel. Our observations suggest that even frozen
pretrained models may gracefully trade accuracy for latency
by skipping layers or running layers in parallel.

1 Introduction
The scale of transformer-based Large Language Models
(LLMs), in the billions of parameters, makes it difficult to
directly understand the models’ behaviour after training. At
the same time, each layer of a pretrained transformer has
an identical architecture as the other layers, with the only
difference being a layer’s position in the hierarchy, and the
values of the layer’s parameters (Vaswani et al. 2017).
We find it helpful to think of the middle layers of a trans-
former by making an analogy to an assembly line of painters.
The canvas (input) is passed along a series of painters. Some
painters specialize in birds, while others are better at painting
wheels. Each painter receives the canvas from the painter be-
low her, then she decides whether to add a few strokes to the
painting or just pass it along to the painter above her (using
the residual connections). In this analogy, each painter uses
the same “vocabulary” for understanding paintings, so that a
painter may receive the painting from a painter earlier in the
assembly line without catastrophe. The painters may also be

Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.reordered without complete catastrophe (even if parts of the
background get painted after foreground objects, occluding
them), and the painters may even all add their strokes at the
same time (in parallel).
This analogy isn’t meant to be a rigorous theory, but rather
a tool for thinking about a transformer’s layers. Inspired by
this analogy, we test how well some hypotheses hold. In this
paper we perform experiments that help address the following
questions:
1. Do layers use the same representation space? (§3.1)
2. Are all the layers necessary? (§3.2)
3. Are middle layers all doing the same function? (§3.3)
4. Does the layer order matter? (§3.4)
5. Can we run the layers in parallel? (§3.5)
6.Does order matter for some tasks more than others? (§3.6)
7. Does looping help parallelized layers? (§3.7)
8. Which variants harm performance the least? (§3.8)
To answer these questions we perform a series of experiments
onpretrained LLMs. These include experimenting with vari-
ations on the standard transformer execution strategy, and
measuring the impact of these variations on the models’ per-
formance across a variety of benchmarks for both decoder-
only (Llama) and encoder-only (BERT) models. Note that
our experiments never involve finetuning or otherwise adjust-
ing the models’ parameters (with the caveat that the GLUE
evaluation standard procedure includes a finetuning step for
our BERT-Large model)
2 Models and Benchmarks
Our experiments are primarily on two transformer models:
Llama2 (Touvron et al. 2023), and on BERT-Large (Devlin
et al. 2019). (However, we also include results for Mistral-7B
(Jiang et al. 2023) and Pythia-6.9B (Biderman et al. 2023a) in
Appendix A.5 that support the generalization of our results.)
Llama2 is decoder-only . We focus on Llama2-7B, which has
7 billion parameters and 32 layers (each layer having 202 mil-
lion parameters), but also include some scaling experiments
with the 13B (40 layers) and 70B (80 layers) models. BERT
isencoder-only with 24 layers and 340 million parameters.
We used the standard pretrained checkpoints for these mod-
els. In all our experiments the models are frozen: we never

or other methods, with the exception of the BERT evaluation,
which includes a standard fine-tuning step.
We used standard benchmarks for both decoder-only
LLMs (for Llama2) and for encoder-only LLMs (for BERT).
For Llama2, we use ARC (science exam questions) (Clark
et al. 2018), HellaSwag (commonsense) (Zellers et al. 2019),
GSM8K (Math Word Problems) (Cobbe et al. 2021), Wino-
Grande (Winograd Schema Challenge) (Sakaguchi et al.
2019), and LAMBADA (word prediction) (Paperno et al.
2016). This last, LAMBADA, measures perplexity and is
closest to the raw token-prediction used during training. For
Llama2, we include the normalized median of the bench-
marks, where we scale each benchmark with 0 being the
performance of random (or max-class) guessing and 1 being
the performance of the full Llama2 model. For BERT, we
used tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al. 2018) and
followed their evaluation protocol, including reporting the
unnormalized average of the benchmarks. Note that standard
BERT evaluation includes a fine-tuning step (Devlin et al.
2019), so our BERT model has a chance to adapt to the new
configuration. Therefore, we also include results from an
evaluation where an additional output layer can adapt, but the
model itself is frozen. These results are in Appendix A.9, and
more details of the GLUE benchmark are given in Appendix
A.8.
3 Experiments
The original motivation behind our experiments came from
the question of whether multiple layers could be somehow
be merged into a single (possibly larger) layer. (Such merg-
ing could potentially be automated (Akiba et al. 2024).) We
hypothesized, perhaps because of the use of residual connec-
tions during training, that the middle layers of a neural net-
work may use a common representation space. (This is not the
case for standard multi-layer perceptrons, where there is noth-
ing to encourage a common representation or permutational
consistency across layers.) The possibility of layers sharing
a common representation has downstream implications for
conditional computation (e.g. (Pagliardini et al. 2024)) or
for dynamically inserting new knowledge into pretrained
transformer models.
3.1 Do Layers “Speak the Same Language”?
To answer whether different layers have a shared representa-
tion space, we test whether transformers are robust to skip-
ping specific layers or switching the order of neighboringlayers. For example, in Llama2-7B, layer 6 normally expects
the output from layer 5. Would layer 6 behave catastrophi-
cally if it were given layer 4’s output instead? In Figure ??,
we see that, with the important exception of the first and last
few layers, Llama2-7B’s layers are fairly robust to skipping
or even switching layers (e.g., feeding layer 4’s output to
layer 6, then sending layer 6’s output to layer 5, then to layer
7).
This experiment would suggest that the middle layers 1.
share a representation space and 2. have a separate represen-
tation space from the “outer” (first and last few) layers. To
further test this hypothesis, following previous work (Fried-
man et al. 2023; Kornblith et al. 2019; Simoulin and Crabbé
2021; Godey, Éric de la Clergerie, and Sagot 2024; Xue et al.
2023), we measured the average cosine similarity between
the activations of hidden states of different layers of our mod-
els (Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and BERT-Large) across our
benchmarks. In Figure 3, we show that this consistency holds
among all the middle layers. For example, the activation in
the fourth layer from the bottom has a high similarity to the
fourth layer from the top. For the 40 layers of Llama2-13B,
we see that the layers form four or five distinct similarity
groups: Layer 0, layers 1-3, the middle layers, then the final
layer or two.
This suggests that the model may have three distinct repre-
sentation spaces for the “beginning”, “middle”, and “ending”
layers. Note that in the 13B model, the number of “beginning
layers” is 3 while the 7b is 2, the “ending layers” is 1 or
2 and 7b is clearly 2. So the number of “beginning layers”
seems to grow as the total number of layers increases. (In
Appendix A.3 we further show that these three classes are
consistent across different model scales, with the beginning
and middle layers growing proportionally to the total number
of layers.) Also note that a high cosine similarity maysuggest
a shared representation space, but a low similarity is more
indicative that the spaces are notshared. However, the fact
that the matrix for Llama2-7B in Figure 3 aligns neatly with
the performance shown in Figure ??is stronger evidence that
thesemantics of the representation space is actually shared,
at least for the middle layers. Based on this, we answer this
subsection’s question with:
Yes, the middle layers seem to share a common repre-
sentation space.

Llama2-7B. Skipping early layers has a catastrophic effect, while the model is much more robust to skipping middle layers.
Figure 3: Avg. cosine similarity between the hidden states of all 32 layers of Llama2-7B (top) and all 40 layers of Llama2-13B.
3.2 Are All the Layers Necessary?
To further test whether the reorientation space for middle
layers is truly shared (in addition to having close cosine
similarity), we experiment with skipping layers. That is, we
send the output of the Nth layer directly into the input of
layerN+M(where M > 1), thereby “skipping” M−1
layers, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Recall that we perform no
fine-tuning during our experiments. Our experiments are to
see if layer N+Mcan make sense of activations from layer
N, though it was trained only on inputs from layer N+M−1.
For this (and related) experiments, we execute the first and
lastN−1layers as normal, skipping (or later modifying)
layers N+ 1through T−N, where Tis the total number
of layers in the model. Figure 4 shows that performance for
many of our benchmarks has graceful degradation for both
Llama2-7B and BERT-Large. (Note that the number of layers
skipped is inversely proportional to N, so the plot goes from
few skipped layers to many skipped layers when read from
left to right.) This result suggests that the answer to whether
all the layers are necessary is:
No, at least a few middle layers can be dropped without
catastrophic failure .
In Appendix A.1, we analyze the layer skipping behavior
across model sizes, revealing a surprisingly uniform patternin the importance of middle layer partitions. Furthermore,
in Appendix A.2, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can en-
hance performance when skipping fewer layers but becomes
harmful when skipping too many.
3.3 Are Middle Layers All Doing the Same Thing?
If the middle layers share a common representation space,
does this mean that these layers are redundant? To test this,
we reran the “Skip” experiments from the previous subsec-
tion, but instead of skipping the middle layers, we replaced
their weights with those of the center layer, effectively loop-
ing on this layer for T−2N+ 1times, where Tis the total
number of layers (32 for Llama2-7B, 24 for BERT-Large).
(See illustration in Figure 1b.)
In Figure 5, we see that the benchmarks quickly decay as
the number of replaced layers increases, and Figure 11 shows
that this variation is the most catastrophic of all we tried,
significantly worse than just skipping layers1. Therefore, we
answer our question with:
No, sharing weights among middle layers is catas-
trophic, indicating that the middle layers are performing
different functions.
1In Appendix A.4, we further explore why skipping is better
than recycling the center-most layer.

3.4 Does the Layer Order Matter?
The previous experiments suggest that middle layers share
a representation space but perform different operations on
this space. Another question is how much the order of these
function matters. We performed two sets of experiments to
test this. First, is running the middle layers in reverse order
from how they were trained2. Specifically, we take the output
of layer T−Nand send it into the input of T−N−1, then
the output of this layer into T−N−2and so on down to
layerN, then send the output of this layer to the last T−N
layers. (See Figure 1c.) In the second variation we ran the
middle layers in a random order (and averaged the results
over 10 seeds).
The results for Reversed and Random Order are shown in
Figures 6 and 7, respectively, each showing graceful degrada-
tion. Figure 11 shows that both of these methods outperform
Skipping the layers, suggesting that layers are still able to
contribute even when run on different input sources (i.e., dif-
ferent layers) from how they were trained. Therefore, we
answer this subsection’s question as:
Somewhat. Both randomizing and reversing the middle
layer order has graceful degradation.
Interestingly, Random Order outperforms Reverse Order
as can be seen more clearly in Figure 11. One possible ex-
2Again, we emphasize that there is no fine-tuning, so the layers
can’t merely adapt to the new order.

planation is that Reverse the exact opposite of the order in
which the layers were trained. So any random order will have
at least as much consistency (in that layer iis after layer j,
where i > j ) as totally reversing the order.
3.5 Can We Run the Layers in Parallel?
If the presence of the layers (i.e., that they’re not Skipped)
is more important than the order in which they’re executed,
we may ask whether we can run the layers independently
from an early input and merge their results, as illustrated
in Figure 1d. To answer this, we ran an experiment where,
instead of skipping layers Nthrough T−N, we ran these
middle layers in parallel, then sent their averaged result to
the final Nlayers.
Figure 8 shows graceful degradation for all benchmarks
except the GSM8K math word problems. In Figure 11 this
variation (“Parallel Layer”) outperforms skipping layers, but
curiously does worse than running the layers in reverse order.
In subsection 3.6, we further explore which benchmarks are
most affected by our changes, so we answer this subsection’s
questions with:
Yes, except for our math-heavy benchmarks.
3.6 Does the Order Matter for Some Tasks More
Than Others?
Note that abstract (ARC) or mathematical (GSM8K) reason-
ing benchmarks have the steepest decline for most variants,

including Reversed ,Skip, and Parallel . One interpretation is
that step-by-step reasoning tasks are more sensitive to layer
order than “semantic” tasks like Winogrande or HellaSwag
(Commonsense). This is because reasoning involves both
structure and semantics to perform well compared with tasks
like HellaSwag where semantics are enough to complete the
task. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that some
degree of order-dependent reasoning is happening within a
single pass of the model. In our Painter analogy, a semantic
task would be analogous to painting a collage, where ordering
is less dependent, where a reasoning task might be more like
painting a precise architectural scene. Regardless of whether
the analogy holds, we empirically conclude that:
Yes! Mathematical and reasoning tasks are more order
dependent than “semantic” tasks.
In Appendix A.7 we show a specific example that indicates
that errors for GSM8K may come from arithmetic errors.
3.7 Does Looping Help Parallelized Layers?
Following the Painter analogy, it’s conceivable that some
layers only “add” to the painting when given the appropriate
input. For example, the “wheel” painter will be more likely
to draw some wheels if she sees the body of a car first. In
transformer terms, layers might only contribute to a forward
pass –as opposed to “passing” the input forward via the resid-
ual connection– when given the appropriate input. If this is

the case, then iterating the parallelized layer from the pre-
vious experiment should improve performance compared to
a single execution of the parallelized layer. We test this by
feeding the mean output of the parallelized layer back into
the same layer for a fixed number of iterations, as shown in
Figure 1e.
In Figure 9, we show the results for looping the paral-
lelized layer 3 times. As can be seen in Figure 11, this method
(Looped Parallel 3X ) significantly improves on a single itera-
tion ( Parallel Layer ). The one exception is when the starting
layerNis 15 for Llama2-7B or 11 for BERT (the left-most
cases for each, where only a single layer is affected). In this
case, the Looped Parallel 3X model is equivalent to repeating
only the middle layer 3 times, while the Parallel Layer for
this point is equivalent to the full model.
We also repeated the same experiment for different num-
bers of iterations. In Figure ??, we show performance for
Llama2-7B as a function of the number of parallelized layers
Mand the number of iterations. The highest performing loop
iterations for each Mis shown by a red box. With the excep-
tion of M= 29 andM= 31 (parallelizing nearly all the
layers), the optimal number of iterations is roughly linearly
proportional to the number of parallelized layers. Therefore,
we answer that:
Yes, with the optimal number of iterations proportional
to the number of parallelized layers.

3.8 Which Variants Are Least Harmful?
Finally, in Figure 11 we compare all the different variants in
our experiments on a single plot, showing the median (for
Llama2) or average (for BERT) performance over all the
benchmarks. Middle Repeat –replacing a period of middle
layers with exactly the same number of copies of the middle-
most layer– does worst by far, quickly degrading to random
baseline performance. On the other hand, looped-parallel and
random layer order have the shallowest degradation, with the
former the best variant for both BERT and Llama2-7B. So
we answer:
Repeating a single layer is worst. Randomizing the
layer order and looped-parallel do the least damage.
These experiments generally show graceful degradation,
but we still have the question of why the layers are somewhat
robust to most of our perturbations. We offer a few sugges-
tions in the Discussion section, but leave a full explanation
for future work.
4 Related Work
A transformer layer contains a pair of multi-head attention
(MHA) and feed-forward network (FFN), and almost all of
the prior works focused on finding a combination of them
that works best, or reducing the parameter count in one way

(Kim et al. 2024) showcased that pruning entire transform-
ers layers can reduce latency without a considerable drop in
performance. This is in line with the findings in (Bhojanapalli
et al. 2021). Also, both the works noted that the performance
drop is substantial if we drop the first few entire transformer
layers. Hence there is an agreement that the first few trans-
formers layers are crucial for performance. One implication
of this observation is that many of these layers would be
carrying redundant information, and this was shown by (Kim
et al. 2024) who removed these layers, and noticed the change
in the PPL score. The authors then removed these layers in
one-shot, and retrained the model with LoRA to make up for
the lost performance,
One aspect where (Bhojanapalli et al. 2021) and (Kim et al.
2024) observations differ though is the fine-grained units.
(Bhojanapalli et al. 2021) observed that removing MLP layers
have lesser impact on performance compared to removing an
entire transformer layer, whereas (Kim et al. 2024) observed
that this behavior is very much dependent on the size of the
models. They noted that removing individual MHA and FFN
modules results in better downstream task accuracy but worse
PPL compared to removing entire transformer layers when
the model has more than 5B parameters. For smaller models
than 5B, layer-level pruning achieves superior results. While
(Kim et al. 2024) did a successful job on pruning the models,
the authors observed an (un)interesting side effect of the
same. The pruned models perform worse when responding to

factual questions or generating long responses. The authors
couldn’t make up for the lost performance on these tasks even
after retraining the models, suggesting that while much of
the information stored in these layers was redundant, some
parts of it were required for critical tasks e.g. factual Q&A.
The experiments of ShortGPT (Men et al. 2024) corrob-
orate the findings of ShortenedLlama, exploiting the redun-
dancy in LLMs to derive a pruning technique. Denseformer
(Pagliardini et al. 2024) had similar findings where they found
that modules even after applying DWA had cosine similar-
ity with original transformer modules, suggesting both that
there is some redundant information flow, and that this can
be leveraged for sparsity.
More recently, (Freiberger et al. 2024) explores layer shuf-
fling during training to enhance robustness of the models,
while (Dutta, Gupta, and Agarwal 2024) proposes an algo-
rithm that can be used for efficient pruning of transformers.
(Lad, Gurnee, and Tegmark 2024) explores the robustness
of transformer-based LLMs by deleting or swapping layers.
(Zou et al. 2024) focuses on efficient inference by splitting
layers in groups, running them in parallel or bypassing them.
On a similar note, (Flynn et al. 2024) focuses on pruning
transformers in different ways (entire attention blocks, ffn,
etc.). Our work is more closely related to (Lad, Gurnee, and
Tegmark 2024) and (Flynn et al. 2024) where the ablations in-
volve frozen models. We present a super set of such ablations
for the frozen transformer models.
5 Discussion
In this paper, we examined several questions raised by the
Layers as Painters analogy. Among our more interesting find-
ings are: 1. There are three distinct classes of layers (with
Middle being the largest). 2. The middle layers have some
degree of uniformity (but not redundancy). And 3. Execution
order matters more for math and reasoning tasks than seman-
tic tasks. We welcome future theoretical analysis of layer
behaviors in transformer architectures based on our empirical
findings.
We leave a full explanation for why transformers are robust

to our variations for future work. One possible hypothesis
is that the residual connections during training are neces-
sary for the layers to share a common representation. It’s
already known that residual connections are useful to help
address the vanishing gradient problem (He et al. 2015), and
that transformers trained without these connections perform
worse than without. However, it would be interesting to rerun
our variations on models without residuals, and see if our
variations destroyed whatever meager gains full non-residual
models achieved.
We also plan to “thaw” our models and investigate if trans-
formers take to adjust to the variations in the paper via fine-
tuning. If these models were fine-tuned with new architec-
tures, the performance would probably be even better. It is
worth noting that Parallel and Skip both have potentially
lower latencies than the full model (assuming enough mem-
ory to execute the layers simultaneously). For example, the
latency for the Parallel Layer for Llama2-7B for N=8 should
be about half that of normal Llama2-7B. Though the aim of
this paper is to better understand layers in transformer-based
LLMs as opposed to introducing new models, our results
suggest simple methods to easily trade accuracy for latency
gains. Our results also suggest that a routing mechanism
for executing frozen layers may be used here, analogous to
Switch Transformers (Fedus, Zoph, and Shazeer 2022).

Abstract
Modern deep learning approaches usually utilize modality-specific processing. For example,
the most common deep learning approach to image classification involves decoding image
file bytes into an RGB tensor which is passed into a neural network. Instead, we investi-
gatemodality-independent representation learning by performing classification directly on
file bytes, without the need for decoding files at inference time. This enables models to op-
erate on various modalities without any hand-designed, modality-specific processing. Our
model,ByteFormer , improves ImageNet Top-1 classification accuracy by 5%(from 72.2%
to77.33%) relative to DeIT models of similar size. Compared to Perceiver IO, our model
requires absolutely no modality-specific processing at inference time, and uses an order of
magnitude fewer parameters at equivalent accuracy on ImageNet. We demonstrate that
the same ByteFormer architecture can perform audio classification without modifications or
modality-specific preprocessing. We achieve 95.42%classification accuracy on the Speech
Commands V2 dataset (comparable to the state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.7%). Addition-
ally, we demonstrate that ByteFormer can operate jointly on images and audio, handling
joint classification without explicit knowledge of the input modality. We release our code at
https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/byteformer .
1 Introduction
Deep learning inference usually involves modality-specific processing. For example, Vision Transformers
(ViTs; (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)) explicitly model the 2D spatial structure of images by encoding image
patches into vectors. Similarly, audio inference often involves computing spectral features (such as MFCCs
(Lyons, 2009)) to pass into a network (Gong et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021). When a user wants to perform
inference on a file stored on disk (e.g. a JPEG image file or an MP3 audio file), the user must first decode
the file into a modality-specific representation. Fig. 1a depicts this process for images.
The practice of decoding inputs into a modality-specific representation requires hand-crafting an input
representation and a model stem for each input modality. Recent works such as Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al.,
2021a) and UnifiedIO (Lu et al., 2022) have shown that Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) backbones
can be used for a variety of different tasks. However, these methods still require modality-specific input

preprocessing. For instance, Perceiver IO decodes image files and reshapes them before passing them into
the network. Other input modalities are processed into different forms.
We hypothesize that it’s possible to remove all modality-specific input preprocessing by performing inference
directly on file bytes. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Transformer architecture able to operate directly
on file bytes. One of the main challenges in operating directly on file bytes is the long token lengths involved.
For example, an uncompressed 224×224TIFF image stored on disk requires 150668bytes. To flexibly handle
long sequence lengths, we replace the multi-head attention in the Transformer with shifted window attention
(Liu et al., 2021), we add token downsampling layers, and we add convolutional downsampling. We call our
model ByteFormer (Fig. 1b).
We demonstrate the efficacy of ByteFormer on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) classification, achieving 77.33%
accuracy on files stored in the TIFF format (Tab. 1a). Our model’s backbone is comparable to ViT-Ti
(Touvron et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) (which achieves 72.2%accuracy on RGB inputs). Compared
to Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al., 2021a), Our method achieves higher accuracy ( 77.27%vs72.70%) with an
order of magnitude fewer parameters (8.8 million vs 62.3 million; Tab. 1b). Our model requires absolutely no
model-specific processing at inference time (though we do use modality-specific data augmentation during

training, see Sec. 4.3). We also present results on PNG files. Surprisingly, our method is even able to operate
on JPEG files, which include complicated compressions like Huffman Codes that aren’t byte-aligned.
We demonstrate that our classification model can achieve 95.8%accuracy on Speech Commands V2 (War-
den, 2018), comparable to state-of-the-art ( 98.7%) (Kim et al., 2021), without any architecture changes or
hyperparameter tuning . We use the same training configuration as for ImageNet, demonstrating the general-
ity of our method. Additionally, a single model can be trained to perform classification of both images and
audio, without architecture changes or hyperparameter tuning.
We also investigate multiple file encodings in our image classification and audio classification tasks. Note
that using file bytes as our input representation means that our model’s performance is dependent on the
encoding scheme used. Some encoding schemes more naturally represent data from a given domain than
other encoding schemes. For instance, uncompressed TIFF images directly store RGB values, whereas
compressed formats such as JPEG store bytes without an easily interpreted semantic meaning. For this
reason, we investigate multiple file encodings in our image classification and audio classification tasks to
better understand how the chosen encoding scheme impacts performance.
Finally, we perform analyses to understand what patterns ByteFormer learns to recognize. We analyze the
learned token embeddings produced by our training procedure, finding that neighboring byte values exhibit
strongsimilarityinuncompressedencodings. Fromanalyzingpositionalembeddings, weobservethatheaders
are weakly correlated with the image contents for most encodings. We also study the impact of byte ordering
on our model’s accuracy, finding that encodings that maintain locality produce a higher accuracy.
In summary, our contributions are: (1) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore models
that directly consume file bytes without requiring modality-specific processing at inference time. We call our
model ByteFormer. (2) We show that ByteFormer achieves strong performance on a variety of image and
audio file encodings without the need for architectural changes or hyperparameter tuning. (3) We analyze
the embeddings learned by ByteFormer and study the impact of byte ordering on ByteFormer’s accuracy.

2 Related Work
To the best of our knowledge, previous works use modality-specific modeling in architecture design. By
contrast, ByteFormer does not contain any modality-specific modeling. However, our work draws inspiration
from previous works, which we discuss in this section.
Architectures With Multimodal Inputs: A few methods have explored the idea of feeding different
input modalities into the same network for processing. Perceiver IO demonstrates that a Transformer
architecture with cross-attention input can be used for a variety of different tasks. However, Perceiver IO
decodes file bytes into modality-specific input before feeding into the model. Other recent works explore
using Transformers to process multiple modalities (Yu et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021; Liu
et al., 2023), but also require modality-specific processing. In contrast, ByteFormer operates on file bytes
directly, and does not require modality-specific processing at inference time.
Efficient Attention Computation: Recent works have explored efficiently handling long sequence lengths
in Transformers. These works are applicable to modeling file bytes directly, since the files we consider can
have up to 150,528bytes. Due to the O(n2)dependency on sequence length of the attention calculation,
many previous works have suggested modifications to the attention computation to improve efficiency. We
experiment primarily with shifted window attention (Liu et al., 2021; Beltagy et al., 2020), which uses fixed-
size windows to compute attention. We also explore bag attention (Mehta et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022) in
our ablation study. Bag attention computes attention hierarchically over windows.
Alternate Image Input Representations: Previous works have explored using alternate input represen-
tations for images. Gueguen et al. (2018) perform partial JPEG decoding, stopping when Discrete Cosine
Transform (Marshall, 2001) coefficients are formed. They modify ResNet (He et al., 2015) to ingest this new
representation. In (Park & Johnson, 2023), a similar method is used with Transformers. Our work differs
in that we perform no decoding of file bytes at inference time.

Analyzing File Bytes: Our method avoids modality-specific preprocessing by directly operating on file
bytes. Directly analyzing file bytes is a technique commonly used in binary analysis , in which computer
programs are analyzed for malware content or security issues. See Heena (2021) for an overview. Our work
differs in that our primary application is not analyzing the security of computer programs. Our primary
appliation is image and audio classification using a machine learning model.
3 Method
We describe our architecture and implementation below. We follow the vision Transformer of Dosovitskiy
et al. (2020), with a few modifications to handle long sequence lengths.
3.1 ByteFormer
An overview of our model is given in Fig. 1b. As input, our model takes in a sequence of file bytes, each of
which can take on one of 28values. We simply treat file bytes as token inputs. The first step of our model
is to use a learned byte embedding E28×dto convert file bytes into embeddings of size d. This differs from
ViT’s approach (Fig. 1a), which involves decoding file bytes into an image, converting it into patches, and
subsequently generating patch embeddings.
Given the large sequence lengths involved when processing file bytes (which can extend up to 150,528in
our experiments), we employ a strided 1D convolution after generating byte embeddings. This reduces
downstream compute and memory usage by reducing the sequence length. Our intuition for choosing strided
convolution is that neighboring file bytes often contain related information.
Next, we add positional embeddings to the resulting embeddings and pass these embeddings to a Trans-
former. Note that the cost of self-attention in Transformers is quadratic with respect to sequence length. To
compensate for long sequence length and allow our model to learn hierarchical representations more easily,
we make two changes following Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021).
The first change is we replace self-attention in Transformers with shifted window attention. Unlike Swin
Transformer, our inputs are only 1-dimensional. Thus, our windowing and shifting operations only occur
over one dimension. This makes our attention mechanism similar to sliding window attention (Beltagy et al.,
2020), but with shifting added.
The second change we make to our Transformer to allow it to handle long sequence lengths is we add
down-sampling layers to halve the sequence length. The resulting contextualized byte embeddings are then
averaged and fed to a linear layer to produce logits.
3.2 Implementation Details
We follow ViT implementation of Touvron et al. (2020). We set model dimension d= 192and use 12 layers
of Transformers for learning contextualized byte embeddings. We adopt strided convolution with a kernel
size ofk= 32, and our stride is k/2. We chose these settings as they performed well on TIFF images, and we
maintained these settings for other experiments. For JPEG, we perform an ablation and find that reducing
the kernel size (and stride) improves performance (Tab. 4), likely due to the shorter sequence length obtained
by JPEG images. Downsampling layers in ByteFormer appear after Transformer blocks 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
Our window size for windowed attention is w= 128.
4 Experimental Setup
When performing inference with a standard Transformer model, the choice of file encoding is irrelevant. For
example, it doesn’t matter whether an image is stored as a JPEG or PNG file because images are decoded
into an RGB tensor before inference. By contrast, ByteFormer performs inference on file bytes. To illustrate
the ability of ByteFormer to perform modality-independent representation learning, we perform experiments
with two different input modalities (images and audio) and multiple file encodings (TIFF, PNG, and JPEG
4
Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2024)
for images, and WAV and MP3 for audio). This section provides an overview of these file encodings. Note
that file encodings typically contain a large number of optional settings that influence the resulting file bytes.
We use default settings provided by PIL(Clark, 2015) or scipy(Virtanen et al., 2020) software packages
unless otherwise stated.
4.1 Image File Encodings
fHWC: We use “fHWC” as an abbreviation for “flattened tensors in height, width, channel order.” It refers
to uint8 image bytes stored in HWC order without any file headers. It is not common to store images in this
way, since they cannot be decoded without pre-existing knowledge of their height and width. This serves as
a baseline that demonstrates the performance of ByteFormer on a rasterized image without file headers.
fCHW: This format is similar to fHWC, but images are stored in “CHW” order.
TIFF:The TIFF file encoding (Parsons & Rafferty, 1998) allows for many custom configurations. For our
experimentation we use the default settings provided by PIL, which do not include compression. This results
in a format similar to fHWC, but with the addition of TIFF image headers describing configuration options
and the image size. Comparing our results on TIFF images to fHWC results helps assess ByteFormer’s
ability to ignore irrelevant file headers.
PNG:The PNG format (Boutell, 1997) contains headers describing PNG configuration options, followed
by rows of image data stored in “IDAT” chunks. Each IDAT chunk contains a byte describing the filtering
methodusedforthatrow’sdata. Thefilteringmethodappliesanoffsettotherow’sdatabasedonneighboring
pixel values. Thus, our PNG file contains rows of RGB data, with offsets applied, interrupted by occasional
bytes that contain file encoding settings. We do not use the optional zlibcompression that PNG allows. We
expect PNG files to provide more challenges to ByteFormer than TIFF, since image contents are encoded
as offsets and interspersed with encoding information.
JPEG:JPEG (Wikipedia, 2023) encodes images by applying a series of transformations to compress the im-
age before serialization. The RGB image is converted to YCbCr, then downsampled in the chroma channels,
then passed through a Discrete Cosine Transform (Marshall, 2001), then quantized using coefficients deter-
mined by the JPEG quality factor. The quality factor determines the level of compression, with 100denoting
no compression due to quantization, and lower values indicating stronger compression. After quantization,
the coefficients are encoded via a run-length encoding, followed by a Huffman encoding (Raghunathan, 2017).
Note that Huffman codes are not byte-aligned, e.g. they can cross byte boundaries. We expect this to make
our modeling task more difficult.
4.2 Audio File Encodings
WAV:The WAV file encoding (Kabal, 2022) stores audio signals represented as a sequence of amplitudes.
We use single-channel (mono) audio files. The most common configuration options are the bit depth and
the frequency. The bit depth corresponds to the precision with which amplitude values are stored. We
experiment with a variety of bit depths, storing audio with 8-bit unsigned integers, 16-bit integers, 32-bit
integers, and 32-bit floating-point values. The frequency corresponds to how often amplitude values are
chosen. We use 16 kHz, a standard choice for audio (Warden, 2018).
MP3:MP3 (Nilsson, 2000) uses a perceptual compression method that removes portions of audio that are
difficult for humans to detect. The remaining portions are recorded in frequency space. An MP3 file contains
a series of frames. Each frame contains a header with encoding settings, followed by the encoded signal in
frequency space. We use standard settings for MP3 provided by the pydub(Robert et al., 2018) software
package. We expect MP3 encodings to be more difficult to handle than WAV files due to the compression
applied.

4.3 Preprocessing
Some file encodings such as TIFF and MP3 are not frequently used in machine learning datasets. To allow
for comparisons on a single dataset across a variety of file encodings, we must re-encode files with different
file encodings.
At training time, we decode the file (e.g. read the contents into an RGB tensor in the case of images, or
read the contents into a 1D tensor in the case of audio), then perform standard training augmentation (e.g.
random cropping in the case of images, or temporal augmentation in the case of audio), then save the result
in the desired file encoding. We find that standard training augmentation is important for model accuracy.
Thus, our training method is implicitly dependent on the input modality due to our augmentation.
Atinference time, we do not need knowledge of the input modality. We only need to ensure that our
model inputs use the correct file encoding. For example, for TIFF experiments on ImageNet, we precompute
224×224crops of the validation images and save them in the TIFF format. Such preprocessing is only
necessary because the ImageNet validation set is not already stored in the desired format. Similarly, for
audio classification, we re-encode the audio clips in Speech Commands V2 into the desired format before
validation.
5 Evaluating ByteFormer
One notable advantage of learning representations using file bytes is the potential for a single model to
be applied seamlessly across various input modalities, thereby eliminating the need for modality-specific
modeling. However, it’s crucial to assess the potential trade-off in accuracy associated with modality-
independent learning. In this section, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of ByteFormer.
We begin by evaluating ByteFormer on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009), demonstrating that it
achievescomparableorsuperiorperformancecomparedtoViT(Sec.5.1). Additionally, weassessByteFormer
on the Speech Commands dataset (Warden, 2018), showcasing its competitive performance against state-of-
the-art methods in audio classification (Sec. 5.2).
Furthermore, we extend unimodal evaluations in both images and audio to a multimodal setting. By training
a single classifier capable of classifying both images and audio directly from bytes, we show that the resulting
model maintains competitiveness with unimodal counterparts (Sec. 5.3).
5.1 Evaluating ByteFormer on ImageNet
Dataset and training details. We evaluate ByteFormer on 1000-way classification on ImageNet. Our
primary comparison is with ViT (Touvron et al., 2020), since our Transformer backbone’s size parameters
match it. We refer to this architecture as ViT-Ti to emphasize that the distillation in Touvron et al. (2020)
is not used. We refer to our architecture as BF-Ti to highlight the fact that our hyperparameters match the
“tiny” variant of the Transformer. In spite of our inclusion of shifted window attention in our architecture, we
use ViT as our primary baseline rather than Swin since the smallest Swin Transformer Liu et al. (2021) has
over3×the parameter count of our largest model. See Appendix A for comparisons with Swin Transformer.
We train using CVNets (Mehta et al., 2022). For ImageNet, we use a batch size of 48on a single machine
equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. At training time, we use random resized cropping, random horizontal
flipping, RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019), and RandomErase (Zhong et al., 2017) before storing the image
in the desired file encoding (Sec. 4.3). We train with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) with weight decay
0.05, and a cosine learning rate schedule that anneals the learning rate from 0.001to0.00002, with 7500
warmup iterations.
For ImageNet experiments, we report Top-1 accuracy of models trained with exponential moving average
(Cai et al., 2021) of weights with momentum 0.0001, which on average increased accuracy by roughly 0.25%.

Effectofimagefileencodings. Tab.1asummarizesresultsforavarietyoffileencodingsontheImageNet
dataset. For BF-Ti, we use a window size w= 128and convolution kernel size k= 32for all models except
JPEG, for which we find k= 8to perform better. Our method surpasses ViT accuracies for TIFF, PNG,
fCHW, and fHWC encodings. We note that fHWC outputferforms fCHW by 2.41%. This indicates that
channel-wise locality preserves accuracy better than spatial locality.
Notably, our results for all encodings except JPEG surpass the modality-specific baseline. This is likely a
result of using a higher parameter count for our embedding layers, and using a longer token length (which
requires more computation). More analysis of runtime characteristics compared to modality-specific models
appears in Appendix A. We emphasize that our focus is not to obtain a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off
compared to modality-specific models. Our focus is on analyzing the feasibility of avoiding modality-specific
processing by using file bytes as inputs.
We find training on JPEG to be more difficult than other modalities. This is due to the highly nonlinear
and variable-length JPEG encoding. Note that, since the Huffman coding scheme used in JPEG is not
byte-aligned, a byte value’s “meaning” is highly dependent on the neighboring bytes. This is in contrast
with other encodings like TIFF, in which a byte value’s meaning is independent of neighboring bytes (for
example, 0xFFalways corresponds to a bright pixel-channel, regardless of neighboring byte values). When
using JPEG, our byte embedding presents a challenge since a particular byte value will always be projected
to the same embedding regardless of the value of neighboring bytes. Even so, our model is able to obtain
65.92%accuracy.
Effect ofk.We investigate the influence of our model’s kernel size kon JPEG accuracy in Tab. 2a. We
find that reducing kfrom its default value of 32increases accuracy. Since JPEG images have a smaller token
length than TIFF or PNG, they are likely less compressible. To further explore this, we investigate two
settings for JPEG quality factor in Tab. 2a. We find that lower quality factors result in lower token lengths,
thus reducing kimproves accuracy. We also try reducing w, but accuracy does not improve.

Our work requires no modality-specific preprocessing, whereas Perceiver requires pixel buffers to be decoded
and reordered. Our method uses an order of magnitude fewer flops and parameters than Perceiver (Jaegle
et al., 2021b;a). We present more details of our method’s computational efficiency compared to related
works in Appendix A. Note that previous works include modality-specific processing, which disadvantages
our model in the comparisons.

Datasetandtrainingdetails. WeevaluateByteFormeron12-wayaudiokeywordclassification(including
“background” and “unknown” classes) of 1-second audio clips sampled at 16khz using the Speech Commands
V2 dataset. Similar to Kim et al. (2021), we train our model with MixUp (Zhang et al., 2017), noise
augmentation, and time shifting augmentation. Then, we store the audio in the desired format. We use the
same training and architecture hyper-parameters as in ImageNet (Sec. 5.1) to demonstrate that our method
does not require modality-specific hyperparameter tuning. For Speech Commands V2, we found EMA to
sometimes increase and sometimes decrease accuracy, so we omit it. We train our models on 4 NVidia A100
GPU machines.
Effect of audio file encodings. Tab. 2b summarizes results for a variety of file encodings on the Speech
Commands V2 dataset. BF-Ti achieves accuracies of up to 95.51%on FP32 WAV files. On MP3 files,
accuracy is reduced. We believe the compression used in the MP3 format makes the learning task more
difficult. This is analogous to JPEG compression reducing accuracy on image classification.
Effect ofk.We investigate the influence of convolutional kernel size kon model accuracy in Tab. 2b. In
general, the optimal kdecreases when the expected number of input tokens decreases. This matches our
observations in ImageNet JPEG experiments. For MP3 files, we observed that k= 32resulted in unstable
models due to the drastic reduction in token length. For MP3, we additionally experiment with window size
w= 32, but it does not improve results.
Comparison with existing methods. Results for audio classification are given in Tab. 2b. BF-Ti
achieves accuracies of up to 95.51%on WAV files, comparable to the state-of-the-art method BC-ResNet-8
(Kim et al., 2021). Note that BC-ResNet-8 is specifically designed for audio processing. By contrast, we
performed no parameter tuning relative to our ImageNet training recipe (besides ablating choices of wand
k). Our best-performing model has window size w= 128and kernel size k= 32.

Figure 2: (a-c):Illustration of the type","Typically, deep learning models for tasks like image classification first need to convert the raw image data into a specific format that the model can understand, like a tensor of RGB values. This preprocessing step is designed specifically for the image modality and can be a bottleneck. Instead, the researchers in this paper developed a model called ByteFormer that can operate directly on the raw file bytes, without any modality-specific preprocessing. This allows the model to be used with various data types, like images and audio, without the need for custom handling. On the ImageNet image classification benchmark, ByteFormer achieved a 5% higher top-1 accuracy compared to previous models of similar size, like DeiT . The researchers also showed that ByteFormer can be used for audio classification on the Speech Commands V2 dataset, achieving comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the ByteFormer model was able to handle joint classification of both images and audio together, without any explicit knowledge of the input modality. This demonstrates the model's ability to learn modality-independent representations."

Abstract
Instructingthemodeltogenerateasequenceofintermediatesteps, a.k.a.,achainofthought
(CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs)
on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains
unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only
transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such
as mathematical problem-solving and code generation (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023;
Achiam et al., 2023; Romera-Paredes et al., 2023; Trinh et al., 2024), far surpassing standard
supervised machine learning techniques. The key to unlocking these advanced reasoning abilities
lies in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate steps, or a chain of thought (CoT), before finalizing
the final answer. This can be achieved through various methods, including training or instruction
tuningamodelwithexamplesenrichedwithintermediatesteps(Lingetal.,2017;Cobbeetal.,2021;
Nye et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022), or through few-shot CoT prompting (Reynolds & McDonell,
2021; Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022).

suggest that the form of CoT prompting is as important as (if not more important than) its content,
because merely instructing LLMs to generate the intermediate steps helps.

ThispaperaimstostudywhytheformofCoTimprovesthereasoningcapabilityofLLMs. Our
hypothesis is that CoT allows for performing more serial computations that a vanilla transformer
cannotdowithoutCoT.Weformulateandanalyzethishypothesisthroughthelensofexpressiveness
with and without CoT. We adopt the language of circuit complexity to discuss the capability of
transformers. Previousworks(Liuetal.,2022b;Merrill&Sabharwal,2023b)haveshownstandard
decoder-only transformers (that output answers directly) are efficient parallel computers and can
only express functions computable in an O(1)-parallel run-time with threshold circuits, TC0, a
computationalmodelthatallowsthe AND,OR,NOTandMAJORITY functionwithmultipleinputs
to be computed efficiently in parallel. We first show a tighter upper bound (Theorem 3.1) for
expressivenessofconstant-precisiontransformer–itcanonlyexpressapropersubsetclassof TC0,
AC0, where MAJORITY gates are not allowed. Our upper bound is also more realistic because
it handles the rounding issue or iterative addition of floating point numbers, while most previous
results essentially only work for fixed-point number addition.
WethenshowthattransformersequippedwithCoT—allowingthetransformertoauto-regressively
generateasequenceofintermediatetokensbeforeansweringthequestions—cansolvecomplexprob-
lems that inherently require serial computations (assuming well-known conjectures in complexity
theory). Intuitively, without CoT, the number of serial computations conducted by the transformer
is bounded by the depth (which is considered as a fixed constant for this work), whereas with T
intermediate steps, the number of serial computations possible is boosted to T. Note that Tcan
easily increase as the sequence length increases where the depth is a fixed number that depends on
the architecture.

many intermediate steps can compute all regular languages, including composition of non-solvable
groups, like permutation group over five elements, S5, which does not belong to AC0and is also
widely conjectured to be out of TC0. As such, polynomially many CoT steps makes transformers
with bounded depth and precision strictly more powerful. We define the problem class that trans-
formerscansolvewithacertainamountofCoTstepsformallyinDefinition3.4andsummarizeour
theoretical results in Figure 1. Interestingly, we also show that logarithmically many CoT steps do
not allow the transformer to compute functions beyond AC0. (Theorem 3.1)
To corroborate our theoretical analysis, we empirically evaluate the capability of transformers
in solving four core problems: modular addition, permutation composition, iterated squaring, and
circuit value problem. We learn transformers to solve these tasks with a large amount of synthetic
data, with and without CoT, or with additional hint but not CoT. The modular addition belongs to
TC0, meaning it can be easily solved in parallel. Liu et al. (2022a) shows it is solvable by constant-
depth transformers with log-precision and, indeed empirically depth 1 is sufficient for the parity
problem (Modulo 2 addition). The other three tasks are all conjectured to require inherently serial
computations. Asexpected,thevanillatransformereitherrequiresahugedepthtosolvethesetasks

2.1 Decoder-only Transformers
Given a vocabulary V, adecoder-only transformer with parameter θand maximal input length
nmaxmapsasequenceofinputtokens (x1, . . . , x n)∈ Vntoaprobabilitydistributionover Vforall
n≤nmax, denoted by pθ(· |x1, . . . , x n). We also define function TFθ(x)by the token in Vthat
maximizes pθ(· |x1, . . . , x n), that is, TFθ(x1, . . . , x n)≜arg maxy∈Vpθ(y|x1, . . . , x n).
Next-token Generator: Given a vocabulary V, a next-token generator with parameter θand
maximal input length nmaxis a mapping from ∪nmax
n=1VntoV. The main next-token generator we
are interested in this work is decoder-only transformers, TFθ(x1, . . . , x n)where xi∈ Vfor all i∈
[n]. We also recursively define TFi

xn+i+1=TFi+1
θ(x1, . . . , x n) =TFθ(x1, . . . , x n, xn+1, . . . , x n+i).
TransformerArchitectureOverview: Thedecoder-onlytransformermodelweconsiderinthis

and is indexed by the layer name and the depth for attention and feedforward layers. 1That is we
can split the model parameter θin the following way: θ= (θPE, θTE, θOUTPUT ,{θ(l)

which are all trainable. (See formal definition in Algorithm 2). Throughout this paper, we use dto
denote the embedding size of a transformer.
Self-Attention Mechanism: Given attention parameter θATTN = (WQ, WK, WV, WO)∈
Rd×d×Rd×d×Rd×d×Rd×d, we define the Attention layer with mask for decoder-only trans-
former in Algorithm 3. Note allowing multi-head attention will not change the class of problems

the token embedding layer by viewing θTEas a mapping from VtoRd, that is, for all x∈ V, the
token embedding is θTE(x).
Position Encoding: Given the parameter of position encoding layer θPE∈Rd×nmax, we define

2.2 Circuit Complexity
Problem. In this paper we consider the following notion of problems: given a sequence of input
tokens, output a token as the answer. Mathematically, given a vocabulary V, we call a mapping
L:∪k∈N+Vk→ Vaproblem. Ifthe correctanswer isalways 0or1, wecall La decisionproblem.
In circuit complexity, such Lis also called a language.
1We ignore the LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) in the usual transformer architecture for simplicity. Our expressiveness
analysis can extend to the transformers with LayerNorm with more careful treatment. See Appendix F.1 for discussion.

3.1 Finite Precision Modeling
In practice, training and inference of transformers are typically done with 16- or 32-bit floating
pointnumbers. Thusinthispaper,wemainlyfocusonthecomputationmodelof constant-precision
transformers, where the output of each arithmetic operation is rounded to the closest floating point
number representable by a fixed number of digits following IEEE 754 standard (Definition 3.2),
thus avoiding the unrealistic infinite precision assumption made by prior works (Pérez et al., 2019;
Dehghani et al., 2018).
Below we give a formal definition of the floating-point number androunding operation. Recall

2max(0 ,e−1). We further use Fe,sto denote all the floating numbers representable using e-bit
exponent and 2s-bit precision (significand), that is, Fe,s≜{S·2−s+E| −22s+ 1≤S≤
22s−1,−2max(0 ,e−1)≤E≤2e−1−2max(0 ,e−1), E, S∈N}. We define Be,s≜maxFe,s.
We also use ψe,s:Fe,s→ {0,1}e+2s+1to denote the inverse of ϕe,s. We note that when the
number of exponent bits is larger than 0, there are multiple ways to represent a number in Fe,sby a
binarystringandweassign ψe,s(x)asthestring a∈ {0,1}e+2s+1withthesmallest |exponent( a)|,
which is unique for all non-zero numbers. For 0we additionally set sign(ψe,s(0)) = 1.

3.2 CoT: Complexity Class for Constant-depth Transformers with CoT
In this subsection, we define the complexity class consisting of all the problems that can be solved
by some decoder-only transformers with CoTwith finite precision.
Definition 3.4 (CoT).Given a finite vocabulary Vand four functions T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n), in-
formally, CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)]is the family of problems solvable by a transformer with a
constant depth, s(n)bits of precision, e(n)bits of exponent, embedding size d(n)andT(n)steps
of CoT. Formally, we say a problem L:∪n∈N+Vn→ {0,1}is in CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)]iff
there is an integer Land three functions T′(n) =O(T(n)), d′(n) =O(d(n)), s′(n) =O(s(n)),
e′(n) =O(e(n)),suchthatforeverypositiveinteger n,thereisa L-layerdecoder-onlytransformer,
denoted by TFθnwith embedding size d′(n),2s′(n)bits of precision, and e′(n)bits of exponent,
thatcanoutput L(x)givenanyinput xinVn,using T′(n)stepsofchainofthought. Mathematically,
it means
TF1+T′(n)
θn(x) =L(x),∀x∈ Vn. (1)
Wealsoextendthedefinitionof CoTtoaclassoffunctioninsteadofasinglefunction. Forexample,
CoT[T(n),poly(n), s(n), e(n)]≜∪k∈N+CoT[T(n), nk, s(n), e(n)].
Definition 3.5 (T).We define T[d(n), s(n), e(n)]≜CoT[0, d(n), s(n), e(n)]as the problems
that a constant-depth, constant-precision decoder-only transformer can solve with O(s(n))bits of
precision, O(e(n))bitsofexponent, O(d(n))embeddingsizeandwithoutCoT(orwithonly 0step
of CoT).
By definition, CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)]is monotone in all T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n),e.g.,
CoT[T′(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)]⊆CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)]ifT′(n)≤T(n)for all n∈N. In
particular,we have T[d(n), s(n), e(n)]≜CoT[0, d(n), s(n), e(n)]⊆CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n), e(n)].

3.3 Tighter Upper Bounds on Transformer Expressiveness
Existing works (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023b; Liu et al., 2022a) have shown that constant depth,
polynomial width, and log precision transformers can be simulated in a small parallel time, i.e.,
using TC0circuits. These results are built on the fact that multiplication and division of n-bits
binary numbers (Hesse, 2001), as well as the iterated addition over ndifferent n-bit binary integers
are in TC0.
However, such TC0expressiveness upper bounds may be unrealistic for transformers operating
with floating point numbers. (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023b; Liu et al., 2022a) implicitly assumes
when adding more than one floating-point number, the algorithm first computes the exact answer
withoutroundingusingarbitrarilymoreprecisionandonlyperformsroundingintheend. However,in

associative (Goldberg, 1991), for example, round (a+round (b+c))̸=round (round (a+b) +c)).
The associativity of integer addition plays a crucial role in the fact that the iterated addition over n
different n-bit binary integers is in TC0.
Inthissection,wepresenttwonovelexpressivenessupperboundsfortransformerswhichround
the immediate result after each step of the arithmetic operation. First, we show a strictly tighter
upper bound than TC0, which is AC0, for constant-depth transformers with both constant bits
of precision and exponents. (Theorem 3.1) This suggests when input length is sufficiently long,
constant-precisiontransformerscannotcounteventually,eveninthesenseofmodular. Forexample,
it is well known that no AC0circuits can decide the parity of a binary string.
Theorem 3.1. T[poly(n),1,1]⊆CoT[logn,poly(n),1,1]⊆AC0.
Our second result, Theorem 3.2, shows that when the number of bits for the exponent is 0(i.e.
fixed-point numbers), TC0upper bounds for the expressiveness of constant-depth, log-precision
transformers still holds, even with the correct rounding defined in Definition 3.2.
Theorem 3.2. T[poly(n),log(n),0]⊆CoT[logn,poly(n),log(n),0]⊆TC0.
We note that the fact that a single forward pass of the transformer can be simulated by an AC0
circuitimmediatelyimpliesthattransformeroutputwith O(logn)stepsofCoTcanalsobesimulated
byAC0. This is because in general one can the transformer output with Tsteps of CoT as an OR
of2Tdisjoint subcircuits, where each of them enumerates all possible values of TCoT tokens and
output the value of the token in the branch where all the intermediate token values are consistent.
This enumeration can be done in parallel and thus only takes constant depth. When T=O(logn),
this only leads poly(n)factor of explosion in circuit size and thus still in AC0. The same argument
holds for TC0as well.
The main technical difficulties in above two results are showing sume,s: (Fe,s)n→Fe,shas
AC0(resp. TC0) circuits when e, sare both constants (resp. e= 0,s=O(log(n))). We view
iterated addition with rounding over Fe,sas an automaton with both state space and vocabulary
beingFe,s. The first result are due to a novel application of classical Krhon-Rhodes decomposition
theorem for automata (Theorem C.2), where we use the property of rounded addition that for all
x, x′∈Fe,s, y∈Fe,s,x≥x′=⇒[x+y]e,s≥[x′+y]e,s. We formalize this property in
Definition D.2 as orderedautomata and show all ordered automata are counter-free Theorem D.3
and thus can be simulated by AC0circuits (McNaughton & Papert, 1971).
The proof technique for Theorem 3.1 does not generalize to Theorem 3.2 because the depth of
AC0circuits constructed before depends on the number of the states of the automaton and thus is

3.4 CoT Makes Transformers More Expressive
Now we are ready to present our main theoretical results (Theorem 3.3) which characterize the
expressiveness of constant-depth, constant-precision transformers with CoT and O(log(n))em-
bedding size. log(n)embedding sizes are necessary to ensure that the position embeddings
forninputs are different. All the lower bounds for transformer expressiveness (with or with-
out CoT) are proved for fixed-point numbers, i.e., without using any exponent bits. Allow-
ing exponent bits will only make transformers more expressive. For convenience, we define
CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n)]≜CoT[T(n), d(n), s(n),0]. The omitted proofs in this section can be
found in Appendix E.
Theorem 3.3. For any polynomial function T:N+→N+,SIZE[T(n)]⊆CoT[T(n),logn,1]. In
particular, P/poly=CoT[poly(n),logn,1].

Proof sketch of Theorem 3.3. The high-level proof idea is that we use each step in CoT to simulate
one gate operation in the target circuit and write the gate output as next input. To do that, we use

Abstract
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used
to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the
performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear
whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions
about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-
scale study on several state-of-the-art open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of
existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic
templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables
more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the
reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when
responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all
models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic
benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models
and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in
a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs
are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning
steps observed in their training data. When we add a single clause that appears relevant to the
question, we observe significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models,
even though the added clause does not contribute to the reasoning chain needed to reach the
final answer. Overall, our work provides a more nuanced understanding of LLMs’ capabilities
and limitations in mathematical reasoning.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains,
including natural language processing, question answering, and creative tasks (Gunter et al., 2024;
OpenAI, 2023; Dubey et al., 2024; Anil et al., 2023; Abdin et al., 2024; Rivière et al., 2024). Their
potential to perform complex reasoning tasks, particularly in coding and mathematics, has garnered
significant attention from researchers and practitioners.
However, the question of whether current LLMs are genuinely capable of true logical reasoning
remains an important research focus. While some studies highlight impressive capabilities, a closer
examination reveals substantial limitations. Literature suggests that the reasoning process in LLMs

Figure 1: Illustration of the GSM-Symbolic template creation process. This dataset serves as a
tool to investigate the presumed reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling the design of controllable
mathematical reasoning evaluations with more reliable metrics. Our results reveal that all state-of-
the-art LLMs exhibit significant performance variations, suggesting the fragility or lack of reasoning.
is probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning (Jiang et al., 2024). Although LLMs
can match more abstract reasoning patterns, they fall short of true logical reasoning. Small changes
in input tokens can drastically alter model outputs, indicating a strong token bias and suggesting
that these models are highly sensitive and fragile (Jiang et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023). Additionally,
in tasks requiring the correct selection of multiple tokens, the probability of arriving at an accurate
answer decreases exponentially with the number of tokens or steps involved, underscoring their
inherent unreliability in complex reasoning scenarios (Schaeffer et al., 2023).
Mathematical reasoning is a crucial cognitive skill that supports problem-solving in numerous
scientific and practical applications. Consequently, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
effectively perform mathematical reasoning tasks is key to advancing artificial intelligence and its real-
world applications. The GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) has emerged
as a popular benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. While it
includes simple math questions with detailed solutions, making it suitable for techniques like Chain-of-
Thought (CoT) prompting, it provides only a single metric on a fixed set of questions. This limitation
restricts comprehensive insights into the models’ mathematical reasoning. Moreover, the popularity
and prevalence of GSM8K can increase the risk of inadvertent data contamination. Finally, the
static nature of GSM8K does not allow for controllable experiments to understand model limitations,
such as behavior under varied conditions or changes in question aspects and difficulty levels.
2
To address these limitations, a more versatile and adaptive evaluation framework is needed—one that
can generate diverse question variants and adjust complexity levels to better explore the robustness
and reasoning abilities of LLMs. This would facilitate a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of these models in mathematical reasoning tasks. We make the following contributions:
•We introduce GSM-Symbolic , an enhanced benchmark that generates diverse variants of
GSM8Kquestions using symbolic templates (Sec. 3), as shown in Fig. 1. This enables a more
nuanced and reliable evaluation of LLMs’ performance across various setups, moving beyond
single-point accuracy metrics. Our large-scale study on 25 state-of-the-art open and closed
models provides significant insights into LLMs’ behavior in mathematical reasoning tasks.
•We question the reliability of currently reported results on GSM8Kand demonstrate that the
performance of LLMs can be viewed as a distribution with unwarranted variance across different
instantiations of the same question. We show that the performance of all models drops on
GSM-Symbolic (Sec. 4.1), hinting at potential data contamination.
•WeshowthatLLMsexhibitmorerobustnesstochangesinsuperficialelementslikepropernames
but are very sensitive to changes in numerical values (Sec. 4.2). We show that performance
degradation and variance increase as the number of clauses increases, indicating that LLMs’
reasoning capabilities struggle with increased complexity (Sec. 4.3).
•Finally, we further question the reasoning abilities of LLMs and introduce the GSM-NoOp dataset.
Byaddingseeminglyrelevant butultimately irrelevantinformationtoproblems, wedemonstrate
substantial performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models (Sec. 4.4). This
reveals a critical flaw in the models’ ability to discern relevant information for problem-solving,
likely because their reasoning is not formal in the common sense term and is mostly based
on pattern matching. We show that even when provided with multiple examples of the same
question or examples containing similar irrelevant information, LLMs struggle to overcome the
challenges posed by GSM-NoOp . This suggests deeper issues in their reasoning processes that
cannot be alleviated by in-context shots and needs further investigation.
Overall, our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the limitations of LLMs in mathematical
reasoning. Our results emphasize the need for more reliable evaluation methodologies and further
research into the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
2 Related Work: Reasoning & Language Models
Logical reasoning is a critical trait of intelligent systems. Recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, yet their reasoning
abilities remain uncertain and inconsistent. Many works have investigated whether LLMs are truly
capable of reasoning by examining how these models solve tasks requiring logical reasoning.
One interesting direction focuses on modeling the computation performed by transformers. For
example, parallels have been drawn between components such as attention and feed-forward modules
and simple computational primitives (Weiss et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024). Delétang et al. (2023)
demonstrated that transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks and showed that structured
memory (e.g., memory tape) is necessary for handling complex tasks. This is related to the
effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and using scratchpads for
LLMs as additional memory for intermediate computations. Overall, current results suggest that
while the transformer architecture has limitations and lacks the required expressiveness for solving
3
problems across several complexity classes, these limitations can be alleviated with additional memory
(e.g., scratchpads) (Liu et al., 2024). However, this still requires generating vast amounts of tokens
to solve a problem (Peng et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024). While these works provide insights into the
theoretical computational complexity of transformers, in practice, it remains unclear whether these
LLMs can perform formal logical reasoning to solve tasks.
There is a considerable body of work suggesting that the reasoning process in LLMs is not for-
mal(Kambhampati, 2024; Valmeekam et al., 2022, 2024), even though it appears that these models
understand symbols and can work with them to some limited degree (Boix-Adserà et al., 2024).
Instead, LLMs likely perform a form of probabilistic pattern-matching and searching to find
closest seen data during training without proper understanding of concepts. While this process goes
beyond naive memorization of words and the models are capable of searching and matching more
abstract reasoning steps, it still falls short of true formal reasoning. For instance, Jiang et al. (2024)
show, with statistical guarantees, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning due to strong
token bias, where the reasoning output of the model changes when a single token of input changes.
This aligns with our results, which indicate that the performance of models on different instances
of the same mathematical question can vary greatly from one instance to another. Li et al. (2024b)
prove that a single transformer layer learns a one-nearest neighbor, which could explain why the
reasoning of models is highly sensitive to input tokens. Schaeffer et al. (2023) argue that when a
task requires emitting multiple tokens correctly, the probability of answering correctly decreases
exponentially with the number of tokens. Dziri et al. (2023) represent reasoning tasks as computation
graphs and find that full computation subgraphs appear much more frequently in training data for
correct predictions than incorrect ones. Razeghi et al. (2022) show a correlation between frequency
in training and test performance, supporting the pattern matching hypothesis.
Our work builds upon these findings by introducing GSM-Symbolic , an improved benchmark using
symbolic templates to generate diverse question variants. This allows us to study mathematical
reasoning ability beyond a single performance metric. By evaluating performance on different
instantiations and difficulty levels, we draw a comprehensive picture of LLMs’ reasoning capabilities.
Our findings support the hypothesis that current LLMs are not capable of performing formal
mathematical reasoning and pave the way for further research on this important topic.
3 GSM-Symbolic
The GSM8Kdataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) includes over 8000 grade school math questions and answers,
divided into 7473 training and 1319 test examples. As shown in Fig. 1, the questions are relatively
simple, requiring knowledge of only the four main arithmetic operations. However, since GSM8K
is a single, popular test set, there is a risk of data contamination, and performance may change
significantly with minor modifications to the questions. These limitations have led to efforts to
generate new datasets and variants. iGSM(Ye et al., 2024) is a math dataset created through
a synthetic pipeline that captures parameter dependencies in a hierarchical and graph structure.
GSM-IC(Shi et al., 2023) shows that irrelevant context can impair LLM performance, focusing on
prompting techniques. Our work, however, suggests a more fundamental issue: LLMs struggle even
when given multiple shots of the same question, indicating deeper challenges in problem-solving that
cannot be resolved with few-shot prompting or fine-tuning on unseen distractions or variations of
the same or different difficulty levels. GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024a) introduces variants of GSM8K
questions but lacks symbolic templates and has a fixed size and difficulty. GSM1K(Zhang et al., 2024)
mirrors the style and complexity of GSM8Kto identify systematic overfitting in existing models, but
has a fixed number of examples, and is not publicly available for researchers.

While the mentioned benchmarks offer a single performance metric on a fixed number of questions,
we argue that viewing LLM performance as a distribution across various problem instances provides
deeper insights. The design of GSM-Symbolic enables the generation of numerous instances and allows
for finer control over question difficulty. We believe our paper contributes to this direction by offering
a reliable evaluation framework that underscores the importance of generating multiple instances
to assess LLMs’ mathematical capabilities and their robustness to diverse problem difficulties and
augmentations.
3.1 GSM-Symbolic: Template Generation
Given a specific example from the test set of GSM8K, we create parsable templates as shown in Fig. 1
(right). The annotation process involves identifying variables, their domains, and necessary conditions
to ensure the correctness of both the question and the answer. For instance, since the questions
are grade-school level, a common condition is divisibility to ensure the answer is a whole number.
We use common proper names (e.g., persons, foods, currencies) to streamline template creation.
After creating the templates, we apply several automated checks to ensure the annotation process
is correct. For example, we verify that none of the original variable values appear in the template.
We also check that the original values satisfy all conditions and that the final answer matches the
original question’s answer. Once data are generated, 10 random samples per template are reviewed
manually. As a final automated check, after evaluating all models, we verify that at least two models
answer each question correctly; otherwise, the question is reviewed manually again.
3.2 Experimental Setup
While we provide further details on our experimental setup and evaluation in the Appendix, we
briefly review the important aspects here:
Models. Throughout this work, we report on more than 20 open models of various sizes, ranging
from 2B to 27B. Additionally, we include state-of-the-art closed models such as GPT-4o-mini,
GPT-4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview. To conserve space, we present results for a few selected models in
each experiment, but the full results for all models are available in Tab. 1 of the Appendix A.2.
Evaluation Setup Overall, for this work, we conducted nearly 500 total evaluations on various
setups. To this end, we maintained a manageable dataset size by using 100 templates and generating
50 samples per template, resulting in 5000 total examples for each benchmark. Therefore, we have
50 datasets of 100 examples each, where each example is a mutation of one of the original 100
examples from GSM8K. Unless stated otherwise, we follow a common evaluation setup on GSM8K
and other math benchmarks that includes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with 8-shots with
greedy decoding. However, we note that in our preliminary experiments, the number of shots did not
significantly change the performance and conclusions. We provide our prompt template in Fig. 9.
4 Experiments & Results
In this section, we present our main results and postpone complementary findings to the Appendix.
We begin our experiments by addressing an important question regarding the reliability of current
reported metrics on GSM8K. By studying the distribution of performance on GSM-Symbolic , we
demonstrate notable performance variation. More importantly, we observe that the performance of
models drops on GSM-Symbolic (Sec. 4.1).
Next, we investigate the fragility of reasoning in LLMs by comparing performance distributions when
only proper names are changed versus when values and numbers are altered. Our findings indicate

from GSM-Symbolic templates shows significant variability in accuracy among all state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, for most models, the average performance on GSM-Symbolic is lower than
onGSM8K(indicated by the dashed line). Interestingly, the performance of GSM8Kfalls on the right
side of the distribution, which, statistically speaking, should have a very low likelihood, given that
GSM8Kis basically a single draw from GSM-Symbolic .
that the original GSM8Kperformance of models is much closer to the performance distribution when
only names are changed. However, performance drops more significantly when values are changed,
with this trend continuing as both changes are applied simultaneously (Sec. 4.2). We then examine
the impact of question difficulty, as indicated by the number of clauses added to or removed from
the questions. Our results show that as the number of clauses increases, average performance drops,
and the variance in performance increases consistently across all models (Sec. 4.3).
Finally, in Sec. 4.4, we tackle a more fundamental question: whether the models truly understand
the mathematical concepts. We show that, likely due to potential pattern matching and the fact
that the training distribution of models included only necessary information for solving questions,
adding seemingly relevant clauses to the question that do not impact the reasoning process required
to solve it significantly drops the performance of all models.
4.1 How Reliable Are the Current GSM8K Results?
Asourfirstexperiment, weevaluatetheperformanceofseveralstate-of-the-artmodelson GSM-Symbolic .
The number of samples and difficulty can be adjusted by modifying variable domains, as we will
see in subsequent sections. Fig. 2 shows the empirical distribution of the performance of models on
GSM-Symbolic computed on these 50 datasets. As shown, all models exhibit a non-negligible variance
across different sets. For instance, for the Gemma2-9B, the gap between the worst performance
and the best performance is more than 12%, while for Phi-3.5-mini, this gap is around 15%. It is
interesting that this variation even exists, as the only differences across different instances of each
question are the changes in names and values, while the overall reasoning steps needed to solve a
question remain the same.

GPT-4oModelsFigure 3: The performance of all state-of-the-art models on GSM-Symbolic drops compared to GSM8K.
Later, we investigate the factors that impact the performance drops in more depth.
Another noteworthy observation is that the performance (represented by the dashed line in Fig. 2)
on the original questions from the 100 examples of GSM8Kused as templates is often more than one
standard deviation away from the center of the GSM-Symbolic performance distribution, frequently
on theright side of the distribution (this holds for 21 out of 25 models). One explanation for this
could be data contamination, where some of the test examples from GSM8Kinadvertently ended up
in the training set of these models, leading to an optimistic bias in performance. Fig. 3 shows the
performance drop from GSM8KtoGSM-Symbolic for several models. We can see that for models
such as Gemma2-9B, Phi-3, Phi-3.5, and Mathstral-7B, the dashed line in Fig. 2 lies on the right
side, and the drop in performance is higher than for models such as Llama3-8b and GPT-4o, where
the performance on GSM8Kis close to the center of the GSM-Symbolic distribution and the drop in
performance is negligible. In Appendix A.3, we present further results to support this claim for
other models such as Phi-2 and Mistral-7B. These results lead us to investigate the fragility of the
reasoning abilities of LLMs in the next section.
4.2 How Fragile is Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models?
In the previous sub-section, we observed high performance variation across different sets generated
from the same templates, along with a performance degradation compared to the original GSM8K
accuracy. This suggests that the perceived reasoning process of language models may not be formal
and is hence susceptible to changes. One explanation is that these models attempt to perform a kind
of in-distribution pattern-matching, aligning given questions and solution steps with similar ones
seen in the training data. As no formal reasoning is involved in this process, it could lead to high
variance across different instances of the same question. In this sub-section and the next one, we
investigate these observations further and we show that several factors contribute to the performance
variation of the models.
First, we investigate the impact of the typeof change to understand the difference between changing
names (e.g., person names, places, foods, currencies, etc.) versus changing numbers (i.e., the values
of variables).

and numbers? Overall, models have noticeable performance variation even if we only change names,
but even more when we change numbers or combine these changes.
Figure 4 demonstrates that while performance variation persists, the variance is lower when changing
names compared to numbers. Notably, the original GSM8Kaccuracy of models is now much closer
to the center of the changed proper names distribution, in contrast to changed numbers or both.
Furthermore, a gradual shift in the means of distributions from right to left, along with an increase in
variance, is evident across almost all models. It is both striking and concerning that such performance
variance exists when only changing proper names, as this level of variability would not be expected
from a grade-school student with genuine mathematical understanding.
From the results in this section, we observe that by increasing the difficulty of changes (from names
to numbers), the performance drops and the variance increases, overall suggesting that the reasoning
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs are fragile for the aforementioned reasons. Assuming that LLMs
are not performing formal reasoning, how important is the question difficulty on the distribution of
performance? In the next section, we study this question further.
4.3 How Does Question Difficulty Affect Performance Distribution?
The results in the previous subsection motivate us to study the impact of question difficulty on
the mean and variance of the performance distribution. To this end, we generate several new
templates from the GSM-Symb , as illustrated in Fig. 5. First, by removing one clause, we obtain
GSM-Symbolic-Minus-1 orGSM-M1for short. Similarly, we can add one or two clauses to the questions
to increase the difficulty, resulting in GSM-Symbolic-Plus-1 (GSM-P1) and GSM-Symbolic-Plus-2
(GSM-P2), respectively1.
1It is important to recognize that adding or removing a clause does not always result in an exact increase or
decrease of one in the number of required reasoning steps. In general, the exact number of steps needed to solve a
problem is not fixed, as there may be multiple valid solutions for each problem, each requiring a different number of
steps. Regardless, our main focus in this section is to understand the evolution of the performance distribution rather
than the precise performance metrics.

Figure 6: The impact of increa","Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in natural language processing, but they still struggle with certain types of reasoning, especially when it comes to mathematical problems. The paper introduces a new approach called GSM-Symbolic that combines the strengths of LLMs with symbolic reasoning capabilities to address this limitation. The researchers found that while LLMs can excel at tasks like answering questions or summarizing text, they often falter when it comes to solving complex mathematical problems that require step-by-step logical reasoning. To overcome this, GSM-Symbolic integrates LLMs with a symbolic reasoning component, allowing the model to break down and solve mathematical problems in a more structured way. The paper presents the results of experiments evaluating GSM-Symbolic's performance on a range of mathematical reasoning tasks, from algebra to calculus. The findings suggest that this hybrid approach can significantly improve the model's ability to tackle mathematical problems compared to LLMs alone."

user’s public key. Icons from Flaticon.com.
3.5 User Identity
The DNS-based user identity in atproto is decoupled from hosting
and indexing. Anybody owning a domain name can issue subdo-
mains as atproto handles, and this does not require running a PDS
or any other service besides DNS.
Handles can change, but every Bluesky/atproto account also has
an immutable, unique identifier: a decentralized ID orDID, which is
a URI starting with the prefix “ did: ”. For example, when a record
in user 𝐴’s repository indicates that 𝐴is following 𝐵, that record
contains 𝐵’s DID; this allows a user to change their handle without
affecting their social graph. DIDs are a recent W3C standard [51].
Moreover, we want a user to be able to migrate to a different PDS
without changing either their DID or their handle. DIDs provide
a mechanism for resolving a DID into a DID document , a JSON
document containing information about the user identified by that
DID, as illustrated in Figure 2. In atproto, a DID document specifies
the handle of the user, the URL of their PDS, and the public key that
is used to sign the Merkle tree root of their repository every time
they add or delete a record. To change their handle or their PDS,
the user needs to update their DID document to the new value.
To prove ownership of a handle, the user must have a bidirec-
tional link between their DID and their domain name handle, as
shown in Figure 2:
•A link from the handle to the DID is established either by
storing the DID in a DNS TXT record on that domain name,
or by returning the DID in response to a HTTPS request to
a/.well-known/ URL on that domain name [39].
•A link from the DID to the handle is established by including
the handle in the DID document that is returned when the
DID is resolved.
The App View periodically checks these bidirectional links, and
invalidates the handle if either is broken. Provided that the App
View is honest and takes measures to protect against DNS poisoning
attacks (perhaps using DNSSEC when available), this approach
prevents users from impersonating domains that they do not own.
3.5.1 Resolving DID documents. The DID specification [ 51] does
not directly specify the mechanism for resolving a DID into a DID
document. Rather, the first substring after did: in a DID indicates
theDID method , and the specification of the DID method defines
the protocol for obtaining the DID document. Hundreds of DID
methods have been defined [ 54], many of which are dependent on
specific blockchains or other external systems. To avoid atproto
implementations having to support so many resolution methods,our services currently only accept DIDs based on either did:web
(defined by the the W3C Credentials Community Group [ 28]) or
did:plc (defined by ourselves for atproto [ 32]). Support for more
DID methods might be added in the future.
The did:web method is very simple: the part of the DID after
did:web: is a domain name, and the DID document is resolved by
making a HTTPS request to a /.well-known/ URL on that domain
name. The security of a did:web identity therefore assumes that
the web hosting provider for that domain is trusted, and also relies
on trusting the TLS certificate authorities that may authenticate
the HTTPS request.
did:web identities are therefore similar to domain name handles,
with the difference that the name cannot be changed, since a DID
is an immutable identifier. This makes did:web appropriate for the
identity of organizations that are already strongly linked to a par-
ticular domain name. For most users, did:plc is more appropriate,
since it uses a domain name only as a handle that can be changed.
3.5.2 The did:plc DID method. When a user creates an account
on the Bluesky social app, they are by default assigned a DID of
the form did:plc:eclio37ymobqex2ncko63h4r , where the string
after the prefix did:plc: is the SHA256 hash of the initial DID doc-
ument, truncated to 120 bits and encoded using base32 [ 32]. A DID
of this form can be resolved to the corresponding DID document
by querying a server at https://plc.directory/, which is currently
operated by Bluesky Social PBC; in the future we plan to establish
a consortium of independent operators that collectively provide
the PLC directory service.
The PLC directory server plays an authoritative role similar to
the DNS root servers, but it is mostly untrusted because PLC DID
documents are self-certifying. If the DID document has not changed
since its initial creation, it is easy to verify that a DID has been
correctly resolved to a DID document by recomputing its hash.
To support changes to the DID document, the initial version of a
user’s DID document contains a public key that is authorized to
sign a new version of the DID document. Any new version of the
DID document is only valid if it has been signed by the key in the
previous version. The directory returns all DID document versions
for a given DID, allowing anybody to check the chain of signatures.
If the directory server were to be malicious, it would not be
able to modify any DID documents – it could only omit valid DID
document versions from its responses, or fail to respond at all.
Moreover, if there were to be a fork in DID document history
such that two correctly signed successor versions for some DID
6
Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media DIN ’24, December 9–12, 2024, Los Angeles, CA, USA
document exist, the directory server could choose which one of
these forks to serve. To mitigate such attacks, we anticipate that
a future version of the PLC directory will use an append-only
transparency log similar to certificate transparency [35].
3.5.3 Authentication. In principle, the cryptographic keys for sign-
ing repository updates and DID document updates can be held
directly on the user’s devices, e.g. using a cryptocurrency wallet, in
order to minimize trust in servers. However, we believe that such
manual key management is not appropriate for most users, since
there is a significant risk of the keys being compromised or lost.
The Bluesky PDSes therefore hold these signing keys custodially
on behalf of users, and users log in to their home PDS via username
and password. This provides a familiar user experience to users,
and enables standard features such as password reset by email. The
AT Protocol does not make any assumptions about how PDSes au-
thenticate their users; other PDS operators are free to use different
methods, including user-managed keys.
4 Related Work
Several other decentralized social networks are in development.
We believe that there is no single optimal design: different systems
make different trade-offs, and are therefore suitable for different
purposes. Bluesky and the AT Protocol aim to provide a good user
experience by providing a global view over the whole network,
making moderation a first-class concern, and having clients that
are lightweight and easy to use. For example, conversation threads
include all replies (unless removed by moderation), regardless of
the server on which they were posted. To achieve this goal we rely
on an indexing infrastructure that is more centralized than some
other designs. However, we emphasize that there can be multiple
competing indexers, and third-party client apps are free to show
data from whichever indexers they wish.
In 2021 some of our team published a review of the decentralized
social ecosystem [ 26]. In this section we summarize some recent
developments that have happened since, and we refer to the review
for a more comprehensive comparison of protocols and systems.
Many decentralized social networking projects have ideas in
common. For example, the idea of using DNS domain names as
usernames also appears in Nostr [ 24]. An atproto PDS has sim-
ilarities to Git repository hosting (e.g. GitHub/Gitlab) or a Solid
pod [50].
4.1 Scuttlebutt
Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is a peer-to-peer social networking proto-
col [1]; Manyverse [ 57] is a social application built upon the SSB
protocol. It optionally uses relay servers called pubs to store mes-
sages from peers that are offline, and to enable user discovery. The
client software downloads the feeds from accounts that the user
is explicitly following, and from accounts followed by followed
accounts (up to three hops by default). This can require significant
amounts of storage and bandwidth on the client.
Any messages from users outside of the third-degree network
are not shown, which effectively limits the set of people who can
mention or reply to a user to the third-degree network. This delib-
erate design decision is intended to reduce moderation problems
by prioritizing conversation between people who already knoweach other [ 53]. In contrast, Bluesky/atproto are designed to allow
anybody to talk to anybody else. This requires more explicit mod-
eration to manage unwanted content, but we believe it also enables
serendipity and is a prerequisite for any “digital town square”.
Since SSB is built upon append-only logs and gossip replication,
it is not possible to delete content once it has been posted [ 55].
User identity is tied to a cryptographic key on the user’s device,
requiring manual key management for moving to another device.
Posting from multiple devices is not possible, as sharing the same
key between devices can make an account unrecoverable [ 56]. A
successor protocol to SSB, called PZP, is designed to address these
issues [34].
4.2 Nostr
Nostr also began as a revision of SSB, replacing the append-only
logs with individual signed messages [ 31]. It leans more heavily
on relay servers instead of peer-to-peer communication: clients
publish and fetch messages on relays of their choice, and there
is no federation among relays [ 23]. The protocol is deliberately
simple, and it prioritizes censorship resistance over moderation:
relays can block users, but users can always move to a new relay,
and use multiple relays at the same time. Communication (e.g. reply
threads) is only possible between users who have at least one relay
in common. Although some services index the whole Nostr network,
these indexes are not used for user-to-user interaction. As a result,
it is unpredictable who will see which message. The creator of Nostr
writes: “there are no guarantees of anything [. . . ] to use Nostr one
must embrace the inherent chaos” [ 22]. Key management is manual
in Nostr, and facilities for key rotation are still under discussion [ 4].
4.3 Farcaster and blockchain-based systems
Farcaster [ 59] has some architectural similarities to Bluesky/atproto,
although it was developed independently. It has storage servers
called hubs, which store the state of the entire network similarly to
an atproto Relay, and it has a concept of hosted app servers that are
similar to our App View [ 52]. Farcaster user IDs are similar to our
DIDs, and they are mapped to public keys using a smart contract
on the Ethereum Optimism blockchain that is functionally similar
to our PLC directory. Usernames can be either ENS names [ 19],
or names within an off-chain namespace managed centrally by
Farcaster, similarly to .bsky.social subdomains in Bluesky [21].
A difference is that Farcaster has no equivalent to atproto’s PDS;
instead, client apps publish signed messages directly to a hub, and
hubs synchronize messages using a convergent gossip protocol.
Users must pay in cryptocurrency to register their public key, and
for hub data storage (at the time of writing, Ethereum equivalent
to $5 USD/year); when a user exceeds their storage allowance, old
messages are deleted. Fees are currently collected centrally by the
Farcaster team [ 30]. In contrast, the AT Protocol does not specify
storage limitations, but leaves it to providers of PDS and indexing
services to define their own business model and abuse-prevention
policies. We also prefer to avoid a dependency on a cryptocurrency.
The Lens protocol [ 38] is more strongly blockchain-based than
Farcaster: it even stores high-volume user actions such as posts
and follows on Polygon, a proof-of-stake blockchain. DSNP takes
a similar approach [ 46]. Placing high-volume events directly on a
7

blockchain incurs orders of magnitude higher per-user costs than
atproto, and is likely to run into scalability limits as the number of
users grows. Lens is adopting a layer-3 blockchain that provides
better scalability and lower cost [ 37], but weaker security properties.
Linking social accounts to cryptocurrency wallets and NFTs enables
users to monetize their content, but this is not a goal of atproto.
4.4 ActivityPub and Mastodon
ActivityPub [ 36] is a W3C standard for social networking, and
Mastodon [ 41] is its most popular implementation. Mastodon gives
a lot of power to server administrators: for example, a server admin
can choose to block another server, preventing all communication
between users on those servers. There is a degree of lock-in to a
server because moving to another server is intrusive: the username
changes, moving posts to the new server currently requires an
experimental command-line tool [ 49,58], and other users’ replies to
those posts are lost. If the old server is not reachable – for example,
because its admin shut it down without warning or because its
domain was seized [ 20] – the user’s social graph is lost. These risks
can be mitigated by self-hosting; managed providers exist [ 29], but
they still require some expertise and cost money. The AT Protocol
separates the roles of moderation and hosting, and aims to make it
easier to change providers without losing any data.
When user 𝐴follows user 𝐵,𝐴’s server asks 𝐵’s server to send it
notifications of 𝐵’s future posts via ActivityPub. This architecture
has the advantage of not requiring a whole-network index. However,
replies to a post notify the server of the original poster, but not
necessarily every server that has a copy of the original post, leading
to inconsistent reply threads on different servers. Notifications can
be forwarded, but in the limit this leads to each server having a
copy of the whole network, which would make it expensive to
run a server. Viral posts can generate a lot of inbound requests
to a server from people liking, replying, and boosting (reposting).
In comparison, the Bluesky indexing infrastructure is also fairly
expensive, but a PDS is cheap to run. Since users can choose their
moderation preferences independently from their indexing provider
(App View), we believe that the ecosystem can be healthy with a
small number of indexing providers.
5 Conclusions
Bluesky and the AT Protocol are a new approach to social media.
Their architecture is based on the principle that every part of the
system can be run by multiple competing providers, and users
can switch providers with minimal friction (in particular, without
changing username, and without losing any of their content or
social graph). For example, anyone can write a client, host a PDS,
index the network, or provide moderation services, and all of these
services interoperate. Even though the majority of Bluesky services
are currently operated by a single company, we nevertheless con-
sider the system to be decentralized because it provides credible
exit[44]: if Bluesky Social PBC goes out of business or loses users’
trust, other providers can step in to provide an equivalent service
using the same dataset and the same protocols.
While some decentralized systems prioritize censorship resis-
tance, we believe that a good user experience requires explicitlyaddressing problematic content such as harassment and misinfor-
mation. We therefore make moderation a first-class concern that
is handled separately from infrastructure hosting, and we provide
strong mechanisms for users to control the content they see. Our
open architecture allows a pluralistic system in which different
users may choose different providers that uphold different values,
while still allowing them to communicate and interoperate.

9","The Bluesky social network is built on a new decentralized foundation called the AT Protocol. This means Bluesky is not controlled by a single company or entity, but rather is an open platform where multiple providers can offer social media services. The goal of this decentralized approach is to give users more control and flexibility. Users can easily switch between different Bluesky providers, rather than being locked into a single platform. The system also aims to give users more agency over the content they see, rather than having a centralized algorithm determine what shows up in their feed. Importantly, Bluesky is designed to provide a simple user experience that hides the underlying decentralized complexity from users. The researchers want Bluesky to feel like a traditional social network, even though it is built on a decentralized foundation. Another key aspect of Bluesky is its openness. Anyone can contribute to moderating content and managing the online community, rather than leaving those responsibilities solely in the hands of a central authority. The researchers hope this will lead to new approaches in social media moderation that can be tested on the Bluesky platform."

Abstract
Collaborative text editing algorithms allow several users to
concurrently modify a text file, and automatically merge
concurrent edits into a consistent state. Existing algorithms
fall in two categories: Operational Transformation (OT) al-
gorithms are slow to merge files that have diverged sub-
stantially due to offline editing; CRDTs are slow to load and
consume a lot of memory. We introduce Eg-walker, a col-
laboration algorithm for text that avoids these weaknesses.
Compared to existing CRDTs, it consumes an order of magni-
tude less memory in the steady state, and loading a document
from disk is orders of magnitude faster. Compared to OT,
merging long-running branches is orders of magnitude faster.
In the worst case, the merging performance of Eg-walker is
comparable with existing CRDT algorithms. Eg-walker can
be used everywhere CRDTs are used, including peer-to-peer
systems without a central server. By offering performance
that is competitive with centralised algorithms, our result
paves the way towards the widespread adoption of peer-to-
peer collaboration software.

Figure 1. Two concurrent insertions into a text document.
1 Introduction
Real-time collaboration has become an essential feature for
many types of software, including document editors such
as Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or Overleaf, and graphics
software such as Figma. In such software, each user’s device
locally maintains a copy of the shared file (e.g. in a tab of
their web browser). A user’s edits are immediately applied to
their own local copy, without waiting for a network round-
trip, so that the user interface is responsive regardless of
network latency. Different users may therefore make edits
concurrently; the software must merge such concurrent edits
in a way that maintains the integrity of the document, and
ensures that all devices converge to the same state.
For example, in Figure 1, two users initially have the same
document “Helo”. User 1 inserts a second letter “l” at index
3, while concurrently user 2 inserts an exclamation mark
at index 4. When user 2 receives the operation Insert(3,“l”)
they can apply it to obtain “Hello!”, but when user 1 receives
Insert(4,“!”)they cannot apply that operation as-is, since
that would result in the state “Hell!o”, which would be incon-
sistent with the other user’s state and the intended insertion
position. Due to the concurrent insertion at an earlier index,
user 1 must insert the exclamation mark at index 5.
One way of solving this problem is to use Operational
Transformation (OT): when user 1 receives Insert(4,“!”)that
operation is transformed with regard to the concurrent in-
sertion at index 3, which increments the index at which the
exclamation mark is inserted. OT is an old and widely-used
technique: it was introduced in 1989 [ 18], and the OT algo-
rithm Jupiter [44] is used in Google Docs [17].
OT is simple and fast in the case of Figure 1, where each
user performed only one operation since the last version
they had in common. In general, if the users each performed
1arXiv:2409.14252v1 [cs.DC] 21 Sep 2024
EuroSys ’25, March 30-April 3, 2025, Rotterdam, Netherlands Joseph Gentle and Martin Kleppmann
𝑛operations since their last common version, merging their
states using OT has a cost of at least 𝑂(𝑛2), since each of one
user’s operations must be transformed with respect to all
of the other user’s operations. Some OT algorithms’ merge
complexity is cubic or even slower [ 39,52,57]. This is accept-
able for online collaboration where 𝑛is typically small, but
for larger𝑛an algorithm with complexity 𝑂(𝑛2)can become
impracticably slow. In Section 4 we show a real-life example
document that takes one hour to merge using OT.
Larger divergence occurs if users may edit a document
offline, or if the software supports explicit branching and
merging workflows. In version control systems like Git, used
mostly for software development, offline working and ex-
plicit branching are already the norm. Recent research indi-
cates that such workflows would also be valuable for writing
prose [ 40,42], but OT-based collaborative editors struggle to
offer such features because of the cost of merging substan-
tially diverged branches.
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) have been
proposed as an alternative to OT. The first CRDT for collab-
orative text editing appeared in 2006 [ 47], and over a dozen
text CRDTs have been published since [ 35]. These algorithms
work by maintaining additional metadata: they give each
character a unique identifier, and use those IDs instead of
integer indexes to identify the position of insertions and
deletions. This avoids having to transform operations, since
IDs are not affected by concurrent operations.
Unfortunately, these IDs need to be loaded from disk when
a document is opened, and held in memory while a docu-
ment is being edited. Some CRDT algorithms also need to
retain IDs of deleted characters ( tombstones ). Early CRDT
algorithms were very inefficient, using hundreds of bytes of
memory for each character of text, making them impractical
for long documents. Recent CRDT implementations have
reduced this overhead considerably, but as we show in Sec-
tion 4, even the best CRDTs available today use more than
10 times as much memory as OT to view and edit a docu-
ment. For this reason, popular apps like Google Docs [ 17],
Microsoft Office, and Overleaf [ 48] use OT. Existing algo-
rithms therefore present a trade-off: either use OT and accept
that offline editing and long-running branches are slow, or
pick a CRDT and accept a much higher memory use.
In this paper we propose Event Graph Walker (Eg-walker),
a collaborative editing algorithm that overcomes this trade-
off. Like OT, Eg-walker uses integer indexes to identify inser-
tion and deletion positions, and transforms those indexes to
merge concurrent operations. When two users concurrently
perform𝑛operations each, Eg-walker can merge them at a
cost of𝑂(𝑛log𝑛), much faster than OT’s cost of 𝑂(𝑛2)or
worse. The example document that takes 1 hour to merge
using OT is merged in just 24 ms using Eg-walker (Figure 8).
Eg-walker merges concurrent edits using a CRDT algo-
rithm we designed. Unlike existing algorithms, we invoke
the CRDT only to perform merges of concurrent operations,and we discard its state as soon as the merge is complete. We
never write the CRDT state to disk and never send it over the
network. While a document is being edited, we only hold the
document text in memory, but no CRDT metadata. Most of
the time, Eg-walker therefore uses 1–2 orders of magnitude
less memory than the best CRDTs. During merging, when
Eg-walker temporarily uses more memory, its peak memory
use is comparable to the best known CRDT implementations.
Eg-walker assumes no central server, so it can be used over
a peer-to-peer network. Although all existing CRDTs and a
few OT algorithms can be used peer-to-peer, most of them
have poor performance compared to the centralised OT com-
monly used in production software. In contrast, Eg-walker’s
performance matches or surpasses that of centralised algo-
rithms. It therefore paves the way towards more collabo-
ration software working peer-to-peer, for example in envi-
ronments where co-located devices can communicate via
local radio links, but not reach the Internet or any cloud ser-
vices. This setting is important e.g. for devices onboard the
same aircraft [ 50], in a military context [ 19], or for scientists
conducting fieldwork in remote locations [15].
This paper focuses on collaborative editing of plain text
files. We believe that our approach can be generalised to other
file types such as rich text, spreadsheets, graphics, presenta-
tions, CAD drawings, and more in the future. More generally,
Eg-walker provides a framework for efficient coordination-
free distributed systems, in which nodes can always make
progress independently, but converge eventually [29].
This paper makes the following contributions:
•We introduce Eg-walker, a hybrid CRDT/OT algorithm
for text that is faster and has a vastly smaller memory
footprint than existing CRDTs (Section 3).
•Since there is no established benchmark for collabo-
rative text editing, we are also publishing a suite of
editing traces of text files for benchmarking. They are
derived from real documents and demonstrate various
patterns of sequential and concurrent editing.
•In Section 4 we use those editing traces to evaluate
the performance of our implementation of Eg-walker,
comparing it to selected CRDTs and an OT implemen-
tation. We measure CPU time to load a document, CPU
time to merge edits from a remote replica, memory
usage, and file size. Eg-walker improves the state of
the art by orders of magnitude in the best cases, and
is only slightly slower in the worst cases.
•We prove the correctness of Eg-walker in Appendix C.
2 Background
We consider a collaborative plain text editor whose state
is a linear sequence of characters, which may be edited by
inserting or deleting characters at any position. Such an
edit is captured as an operation ; the operation Insert(𝑖,𝑐)
2
Collaborative Text Editing with Eg-walker: Better, Faster, Smaller EuroSys ’25, March 30-April 3, 2025, Rotterdam, Netherlands
inserts character 𝑐at index𝑖, and Delete(𝑖)deletes the char-
acter at index 𝑖(indexes are zero-based). Our implementation
compresses runs of consecutive insertions or deletions, but
for simplicity we describe the algorithm in terms of single-
character operations.
2.1 System model
Each device on which a user edits a document is a replica , and
each replica stores the full editing history of the document.
When a user makes an insertion or deletion, that operation
is immediately applied to the user’s local replica, and then
asynchronously sent over the network to any other replicas
that have a copy of the same document. Users can also edit
their local copy while offline; the corresponding operations
are then enqueued and sent when the device is next online.
Our algorithm assumes a reliable broadcast protocol that
detects and retransmits lost messages, but makes no other
assumptions about the network. For example, a relay server
could store and forward messages from one replica to the
others, or replicas could use a peer-to-peer gossip proto-
col. We make no timing assumptions and tolerate arbitrary
network delay, but we assume replicas are non-Byzantine.
Our algorithm ensures convergence : any two replicas that
have seen the same operations have the same document state
(i.e., a text consisting of the same sequence of characters),
even if the operations arrived in a different order at each
replica. If the underlying broadcast protocol ensures that ev-
ery non-crashed replica eventually receives every operation,
the algorithm achieves strong eventual consistency [53].
2.2 Event graphs
We represent the editing history of a document as an event
graph : a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which every node is
anevent consisting of an operation (insert/delete a character),
a unique ID, and the set of IDs of its parent events . When
𝑎is a parent of𝑏, we also say 𝑏is a child of𝑎, and the
graph contains an edge from 𝑎to𝑏. We construct events
such that the graph is transitively reduced (i.e., it contains
no redundant edges). When there is a directed path from 𝑎
to𝑏we say that 𝑎happened before 𝑏, and write 𝑎→𝑏as
per Lamport [ 38]. The→relation is a strict partial order. We
say that events 𝑎and𝑏areconcurrent , written𝑎∥𝑏, if both
events are in the graph, 𝑎≠𝑏, and neither happened before
the other:𝑎↛𝑏∧𝑏↛𝑎.
The frontier is the set of events with no children. When-
ever a user performs an operation, a new event containing
that operation is added to the graph, and the previous fron-
tier in the replica’s local copy of the graph becomes the new
event’s parents. The new event is then broadcast over the
network, and each replica adds it to its copy of the graph. If
any parents are missing (i.e., a parent ID in the event does
not resolve to a known event), the replica waits for them to
arrive before adding them to the graph; the result is a simple
causal broadcast protocol [ 11,13]. Two replicas can merge𝑒1:Insert(0,“H”)
𝑒2:Insert(1,“e”)

𝑒5:Insert(3,“l”)𝑒6:Insert(4,“!”)

their event graphs by taking the union of their sets of events.
Events in the graph are immutable; they always represents
the operation as originally generated, and not as a result
of any transformation. The graph grows monotonically (we
never remove events), and a new event is always a child of
existing events (we never add a parent to an existing event).
For example, Figure 2 shows the event graph correspond-
ing to Figure 1. The events 𝑒5and𝑒6are concurrent, and the
frontier of this graph is the set of events {𝑒5,𝑒6}.
The event graph for a substantial document, such as a
research paper, may contain hundreds of thousands of events.
It can nevertheless be stored in a very compact form by
exploiting the typical editing patterns of humans writing
text: characters tend to be inserted or deleted in consecutive
runs. Many portions of a typical event graph are linear, with
each event having one parent and one child. We describe the
storage format in more detail in Section 3.8.
2.3 Document versions
Let𝐺be an event graph, represented as a set of events. Due
to convergence, any two replicas that have the same set
of events must be in the same state. Therefore, the docu-
ment state (sequence of characters) resulting from 𝐺must
bereplay(𝐺), where replay is some pure (deterministic and
non-mutating) function. In principle, any pure function of
the set of events results in convergence, although a replay
function that is useful for text editing must satisfy additional
criteria (see Section 3.1).
Consider the event Delete(𝑖), which deletes the character
at position𝑖in the document. In order to correctly interpret
this event, we need to determine which character was at
index𝑖at the time when the operation was generated.
More generally, let 𝑒𝑖be some event. The document state
when𝑒𝑖was generated must be replay(𝐺𝑖), where𝐺𝑖is the
set of events that were known to the generating replica at
the time when 𝑒𝑖was generated (not including 𝑒𝑖itself). By
definition, the parents of 𝑒𝑖are the frontier of 𝐺𝑖, and thus
𝐺𝑖is the set of all events that happened before 𝑒𝑖, i.e.,𝑒𝑖’s
parents and all of their ancestors. Therefore, the parents of 𝑒𝑖
unambiguously define the document state in which 𝑒𝑖must
be interpreted.

EuroSys ’25, March 30-April 3, 2025, Rotterdam, Netherlands Joseph Gentle and Martin Kleppmann
To formalise this, given an event graph (set of events) 𝐺,
we define the version of𝐺to be its frontier set:
Version(𝐺)={𝑒1∈𝐺|𝑒2∈𝐺:𝑒1→𝑒2}
Given some version 𝑉, the corresponding set of events
can be reconstructed as follows:
Events(𝑉)=𝑉∪{𝑒1|∃𝑒2∈𝑉:𝑒1→𝑒2}
Since an event graph grows only by adding events that
are concurrent to or children of existing events (we never
change the parents of an existing event), there is a one-to-
one correspondence between an event graph and its version.
For all valid event graphs 𝐺,Events(Version(𝐺))=𝐺.
The set of parents of an event in the graph is the version
of the document in which that operation must be interpreted.
The version can hence be seen as a logical clock , describing
the point in time at which a replica knows about the exact
set of events in 𝐺. Even if the event graph is large and there
are many collaborators, a version rarely consists of more
than two events in practice: a version with 𝑛events occurs
only if𝑛mutually concurrent events are merged with no
new operations being generated in the intervening time.
2.4 Replaying editing history
Collaborative editing algorithms are usually defined in terms
of sending and receiving messages over a network. The
abstraction of an event graph allows us to reframe these
algorithms in a simpler way: a collaborative text editing
algorithm is a pure function replay(𝐺)of an event graph
𝐺. This function can use the parent-child relationships to
partially order events, but concurrent events could be pro-
cessed in any order. This allows us to separate the process of
replicating the event graph from the algorithm that ensures
convergence. In fact, this is how pure operation-based CRDTs
[9] are formulated, as discussed in Section 5.
In addition to determining the document state from an
entire event graph, we need an incremental update function.
Say we have an existing event graph 𝐺and corresponding
document state doc=replay(𝐺). Then an event 𝑒from a
remote replica is added to the graph. We could rerun the
function to obtain doc′=replay(𝐺∪{𝑒}), but it would be
inefficient to process the entire graph again. Instead, we need
to efficiently compute the operation to apply to docin order
to obtain doc′. For text documents, this incremental update is
also described as an insertion or deletion at a particular index;
however, the index may differ from that in the original event
due to the effects of concurrent operations, and a deletion
may turn into a no-op if the same character has also been
deleted by a concurrent operation.
Both OT and CRDT algorithms focus on this incremental
update. If none of the events in 𝐺are concurrent with 𝑒, OT
is straightforward: the incremental update is identical to the
operation in 𝑒, as no transformation takes place. If there is𝑒A1

concurrency, OT must transform each new event with regard
to each existing event that is concurrent to it.
In CRDTs, each event is first translated into operations
that use unique IDs instead of indexes, and then these oper-
ations are applied to a data structure that reflects all of the
operations seen so far (both concurrent operations and those
that happened before). In order to update the text editor,
these updates to the CRDT’s internal structure need to be
translated back into index-based insertions and deletions.
Many CRDT papers elide this translation from unique IDs
back to indexes, but it is important for practical applications.
Regardless of whether the OT or the CRDT approach is
used, a collaborative editing algorithm can be boiled down to
an incremental update to an event graph: given an event to
be added to an existing event graph, return the (index-based)
operation that must be applied to the current document state
so that the resulting document is identical to replaying the
entire event graph including the new event.
2.5 Implementing OT using a CRDT
One way of implementing such a replay algorithm would
be to simulate a network of CRDT replicas in a single pro-
cess. For each branch in the event graph there is a separate
simulated replica, which takes operations in their original
index-based form and generates a corresponding ID-based
CRDT operation. Another simulated replica receives every
operation generated by the other replicas and applies them
in some topologically sorted order, as illustrated in Figure 3.
For example, the history in Figure 3 could be replayed us-
ing one simulated replica for 𝑒A1...A6, a second for 𝑒B1...B4, and
a third for𝑒C1...C3. Every time an event’s parent is an event
generated on another simulated replica, the corresponding
network communication is simulated, and the remote op-
erations are merged using a CRDT algorithm. For example,
before the replica for 𝑒B1...B4can generate 𝑒B3it must first
merge𝑒A2and𝑒A3. Each simulated replica thus tracks the
document version in which the indexes of insertions and
deletions should be interpreted. The simulated replica that
applies all operations then converts the ID-based operation
4
Collaborative Text Editing with Eg-walker: Better, Faster, Smaller EuroSys ’25, March 30-April 3, 2025, Rotterdam, Netherlands
back into an index based on its document version. This index-
based operation then allows an incremental update of the
document state.
The process of translating an index-based operation into
an ID-based one on one simulated replica, and translating it
back into an index-based operation on another, is effectively
an operational transformation algorithm: it updates the index
to reflect the effects of concurrent operations (which have
been applied to the second simulated replica but not the
first). However, the algorithm is fairly slow because it incurs
the overhead of updating multiple simulated replicas and
running the CRDT algorithm even at times when there is no
concurrency in the event graph. It also uses a lot of memory
because it needs a separate copy of the CRDT state for every
concurrent branch in the event graph.
Our Eg-walker algorithm, described in the next section,
modifies this approach to use only two simulated replicas:
one on which operations are generated, and the other on
which all operations are applied (and in fact, both are stored
in the same data structure). To deal with event graphs that
are not totally ordered, the algorithm allows events on one
branch to be retreated when switching to another branch, and
advanced again when those branches are merged. Retreating
an event updates the replica state to behave as if that event
had not yet happened, and advancing makes the event take
effect again.
For example, in Figure 3, after applying 𝑒A4we would
retreat𝑒A4,𝑒A3, and𝑒A2before applying 𝑒B1, since those
events are concurrent with 𝑒B1. Before applying 𝑒B3we would
advance𝑒A2and𝑒A3again, since they are ancestors of 𝑒B3.
Retreating and advancing takes some additional CPU time on
highly concurrent event graphs, but as we show in Section 4,
the optimisations this approach enables result in excellent
performance overall.
3 The Event Graph Walker algorithm
Eg-walker is a collaborative text editing algorithm based on
the idea of event graph replay. The algorithm builds on a
replication layer that ensures that whenever a replica adds
an event to the graph, all non-crashed replicas eventually
receive it. The state of each replica consists of three parts:
1.Event graph: Each replica stores a copy of the event
graph on disk, in a format described in Section 3.8.
2.Document state: The current sequence of characters
in the document with no further metadata. On disk
this is simply a plain text file; in memory it may be
represented as a rope [ 12], piece table [ 41], or similar
structure to support efficient insertions and deletions.
3.Internal state: A temporary CRDT structure that
Eg-walker uses to merge concurrent edits. It is not
persisted or replicated, and it is discarded when the
algorithm finishes running.Eg-walker can reconstruct the document state by replay-
ing the entire event graph. It first performs a topological sort,
as illustrated in Figure 3. Then each event is transformed so
that the transformed insertions and deletions can be applied
in topologically sorted order, starting with an empty doc-
ument, to obtain the document state. In Git parlance, this
process “rebases” a DAG of operations into a linear operation
history with the same effect. The input of the algorithm is
the event graph, and the output is this topologically sorted
sequence of transformed operations. While OT transforms
one operation with respect to one other, Eg-walker uses the
internal state to transform sets of operations efficiently.
In graphs with concurrent operations there are multiple
possible sort orders. Eg-walker guarantees that the final
document state is the same, regardless which of these orders
is chosen. However, the choice of sort order may affect the
performance of the algorithm, as discussed in Section 3.7.
For example, the graph in Figure 2 has two possible sort
orders; Eg-walker either first inserts “l” at index 3 and then
“!” at index 5 (like User 1 in Figure 1), or it first inserts “!” at
index 4 followed by “l” at index 3 (like User 2 in Figure 1).
The final document state is “Hello!” either way.
Event graph replay easily extends to incremental updates
for real-time collaboration: when a new event is added to the
graph, it becomes the next element of the topologically sorted
sequence. We can transform each new event in the same way
as during replay, and apply the transformed operation to the
current document state.
3.1 Characteristics of Eg-walker
Eg-walker ensures that the resulting document state is consis-
tent with Attiya et al.’s strong list specification [8] (in essence,
replicas converge to the same state and apply operations in
the right place), and it is maximally non-interleaving [60]
(i.e., concurrent sequences of insertions at the same position
are placed one after another, and not interleaved).
When generating new events, or when adding an event to
the graph that happened after all existing events, Eg-walker
only needs the current document state. Most of the time,
the event graph can thus remain on disk without using any
space in memory or any CPU time, and the internal state can
be discarded entirely. The event graph and internal state are
only required when handling concurrency, and even then
we only have to replay the portion of the graph since the
last ancestor that the concurrent operations had in common.
In portions of the event graph that have no concurrency
(which, in many editing histories, is the vast majority of
events), events do not need to be transformed at all.
In contrast, existing CRDTs require every replica to persist
the internal state and send it over the network. They also
require that state to be loaded into memory to generate and
receive operations, even when there is no concurrency. This
uses several times more memory and makes documents slow
to load.
5
EuroSys ’25, March 30-April 3, 2025, Rotterdam, Netherlands Joseph Gentle and Martin Kleppmann
OT algorithms avoid this internal state; similarly to Eg-
walker, they only need to persist the latest document state
and the history of operations that are concurrent to opera-
tions that may arrive in the future. In both Eg-walker and OT,
the event graph can be discarded if we know that no event
we may receive in the future will be concurrent with any ex-
isting event. However, OT algorithms are very slow to merge
long-running branches (see Section 4). Eg-walker handles
arbitrary event DAGs, whereas some OT algorithms are only
able to handle restricted forms of event graphs (server-based
OT corresponds to event graphs with one main branch rep-
resenting the server’s view; all other branches may merge
to and from the main branch, but not with each other).
3.2 Walking the event graph
For the sake of clarity we first explain a simplified version
of Eg-walker that replays the entire event graph without
discarding its internal state along the way. This approach
incurs some CRDT overhead even for non-concurrent oper-
ations. We give pseudocode for this simplified algorithm in
Appendix B. In Section 3.6 we show how the algorithm can
be optimised to replay only a part of the event graph.
First, we topologically sort the event graph in a way that
keeps events on the same branch consecutive as much as pos-
sible: for example, in Figure 3 we first visit 𝑒A1...𝑒 A4, then
𝑒B1...𝑒 B4. We avoid alternating between branches, such as
𝑒A1,𝑒B1,𝑒A2,𝑒B2..., even though that would also be a valid
topological sort. For this we use a standard textbook algo-
rithm [ 16]: perform a depth-first traversal starting from the
oldest event, and build up the topologically sorted list in
the order that events are visited. When a node has multi-
ple children in the graph, we choose their order based on
a heuristic so that branches with fewer events tend to ap-
pear before branches with more events in the sorted order;
this can improve performance (see Section 3.7) but is not
essential. We estimate the size of a branch by counting the
number of events that happened after each event.
The algorithm then processes the events one at a time
in topologically sorted order, updating the internal state
and outputting a transformed operation for each event. The
internal state simultaneously captures the document at two
versions: the version in which an event was generated (which
we call the prepare version), and the version in which all
events seen so far have been applied (which we call the effect
version). These correspond to the two simulated replicas
mentioned in Section 2.5. If the prepare and effect versions
are the same, the transformed operation is identical to the
original one. In general, the prepare version represents a
subset of the events of the effect version.
The internal state can be updated with three methods,
each of which takes an event as argument:

Abstract
We study whether transformers can learn to implicitly reason over parametric knowl-
edge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on
two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently
find that transformers canlearn implicit reasoning, but only through grokking , i.e.,
extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary
across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers
fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We
delve into the model’s internals throughout training, conducting analytical exper-
iments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of
the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing
and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the
configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training
setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to
the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large
search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory
fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully
grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of
parametric memory for complex reasoning.2
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have been shown deficient in implicit reasoning with their parametric
memory of knowledge and rules. For example, a range of LLMs are found to be incapable of robustly
composing internalized facts [ 48,71], and even GPT-4 [ 42] cannot adequately compare entities’
attributes despite knowing them [1].
Deficiency in implicit reasoning has profound implications. It implies the models’ limitations in induc-
ing structured and compressed representations of facts and rules, which lead to redundant knowledge
storage and difficulty in propagating knowledge updates [ 76], and importantly, fundamentally impede
the model from systematic generalization over knowledge [ 25]. While explicit verbalizations of
reasoning steps (e.g., chain-of-thought rationales) can improve task performance [ 67,64,73,55,31],
they are not available during large-scale (pre-)training where the model’s core capabilities are
acquired [77, 29].
Is implicit reasoning doomed given that even the most capable models struggle? Can it be resolved
by further scaling data and compute, or are there fundamental limitations of the transformer [ 62]
that prohibit robust acquisition of this skill?

Figure 1: We find that transformers can learn to reason implicitly, but this skill is only robustly
acquired through grokking , i.e., an extended period of training far beyond overfitting. Moreover,
the transformer fails to systematically generalize for composition, yet succeeds for comparison. We
conduct a mechanistic study into the model internals throughout grokking, which reveals distinct
generalizing circuits across the two tasks (Figure 4, 5) that explains the variations in systematicity.
In this paper, we rigorously study these questions by constructing synthetic training and evaluation
datasets, training transformers from scratch, and examining their generalization. We conceptualize
reasoning as the induction and application of inference rules , and expose the model to a mixture of
“atomic facts” and “inferred facts” (which are deduced from the atomic facts via a set of latent rules),
resembling “axioms” and “theorems” in a formal system. To evaluate how well the model learns
the rules, we test its ability to make novel deductions (i.e., completing unseen inferred facts) in both
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.3This approach allows us to control
the training data and perform clean evaluations, which would be challenging when studying existing
LLMs trained on uncontrolled data.
Our experiments reveal that transformers canlearn to perform implicit reasoning, but this skill is
only robustly acquired through extended training far beyond overfitting (Figure 1), a phenomenon
known as grokking [47]. We find that the speed of improvement in generalization correlates with
theratio between inferred and atomic facts in training, and depends little on the absolute sizeof
the training data (Figure 2). This suggests a correction of prior explanations of grokking based on
critical data size [33,61,78,21], in that it should instead be the critical data distribution that decides
the characteristics of grokking. Our findings extend prior observations of the grokking phenomenon
primarily in algorithmic and linguistic tasks [ 47,38] to the domain of knowledge-based reasoning,
and deepen our understanding of the grokking phenomenon.
Moreover, we find that the transformer exhibits different levels of systematicity across reasoning
types. While ID generalization is consistently observed, in the OOD setting, the model fails to
systematically generalize for composition but succeeds in comparison (Figure 1). To understand why
this happens, we conduct mechanistic analysis of the internal mechanisms of the model. The analysis
uncovers the gradual formation of the generalizing circuit throughout grokking and establishes the
connection between systematicity and its configuration, specifically, the way atomic knowledge
and rules are stored and applied within the circuit. Our findings imply that proper cross-layer
memory-sharing mechanisms for transformers such as memory-augmentation [ 54,17] and explicit
recurrence [7, 22, 57] are needed to further unlock transformer’s generalization.
Finally, to demonstrate the power and potential of parametric memory for complex reasoning, we
show that for a reasoning task with a large search space, a fully grokked transformer can achieve
near-perfect accuracy, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo [ 43] and Gemini-1.5-Pro [ 16]
based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation.
3Definitions of ID/OOD are introduced in §2.

2 General Setup
Training data & ID/OOD evaluation. As stated in §1, we are interested in whether transformers
can induce and apply latent rules over knowledge implicitly in a generalizable way. We create a data-
generating process consisting of 1) sampling a set of basic atomic facts , and 2) using the atomic facts
and latent rules to deduce inferred facts . To better characterize the level of generalization acquired by
the model, we evaluate the model’s in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
We prepare two separate sets of atomic facts: atomic IDandatomic OOD. Our training set includes
allthe atomic facts and a uniformly random portion of the inferred facts deduced from atomic ID,
which we call train_inferred ID. For evaluation, (1) ID generalization aims to evaluate whether
the model learns the latent rules correctly, by testing its ability to complete unseen inferred facts
also deduced from atomic ID, which we denote by test_inferred ID. (2) OOD generalization
aims to evaluate the systematicity [25] acquired by the model, namely, the ability to apply rules over
knowledge regardless of its distribution. To do this, we test the model on the facts deduced from
atomic OOD, denoted by test_inferred OOD.
Model & optimization. We use a standard decoder-only transformer model as in GPT-2 [ 50] with
8layers, 768hidden dimensions and 12attention heads (we explore the impact of different model
scales in Appendix B). Optimization is done by AdamW [ 34] with learning rate 10−4, batch size
512, weight decay 0.1and2000 warm-up steps. Notably, models are trained for a large number of
epochs/steps beyond the point where training performance saturates. More details are in Appendix A.
3 Composition—Delayed Generalization without Systematicity
We begin our investigation with composition , where a model needs to “chain” different pieces of
facts, e.g., “Barack’s wife is Michelle” and“Michelle is born in 1964” , to successfully complete
a compositional sentence, e.g., “Barack’s wife is born in [1964]” . Prior work extensively studied
whether transformer-based language models can perform implicit composition, and negative results
are consistently reported [ 48,1,71]. Specifically, there exists a “compositionality gap” [48], i.e.,
the frequency at which the model knows all the underlying basic facts but fails to compose them,
which is considerable across different LLMs and does not decrease as models scale. Are transformers
doomed to fail on such kind of reasoning, and if so, why?
3.1 Setup
We focus on two-hop composition in this work. For atomic facts, we generate a random knowledge
graphGconsisting of |E|entities and |R|= 200 relations, where each entity (as the subject) has 20
random distinct relations that each connects to another random entity (as the object). The atomic
facts are then the edges, i.e., (subject, relation, object) triplets in G, which we partition disjointly into
atomic IDandatomic OOD(95%:5%). The rule of (two-hop) composition is
∀h, b, t∈ E,∀r1, r2∈ R,(h, r 1, b)∧(b, r2, t) =⇒(h, r 1, r2, t), (1)
which is used to deduce the ID and OOD inferred facts from atomic IDandatomic OOD, respectively.
For convenience, in the above rule, we will call hthehead entity, bthebridge entity, and tthetail
entity. For both atomic and inferred facts, training/testing is done by having the model predict the
final tail entity. We assign a unique token to each relation/entity by default, and also find that the
results are robust to different tokenizations (details in Appendix C).
We study the influence of the following two aspects on the model’s learned behaviors:
•Ratio between inferred and atomic facts. By varying the amount of inferred facts included in
training, we study the effect of the ratio ϕ=|train_inferred ID|/|atomic ID|on the model.
•Training data size. We study the impact of the training data size by varying |E|, the total number
of entities, while controlling the ratio ϕ. Note that the size of training data (both atomic/inferred
facts) scales linearly with |E|.
3.2 Results
Grokking observed in ID generalization but not in OOD generalization . Figure 1(left) shows the
model’s accuracy on the train and test facts throughout optimization, with |E|= 2000 andϕ= 7.2.
3
We find that the model cangeneralize to ID test examples, but high performance is only achieved
through extended training far beyond overfitting, a phenomenon called grokking [47]. Specifically, the
training performance saturates (over 99% accuracy on both atomic and inferred facts) at around 14K
optimization steps, before which the highest ID generalization accuracy is merely 9.2%. However,
generalization keeps improving by simply training for longer, and approaches almost perfect accuracy
after extended optimization lasting around 50times the steps taken to fit the training data. On the
other hand, OOD generalization is never observed. We extend the training to 2million optimization
steps, and there is still no sign of OOD generalization.
Inferred/atomic ratio ϕcorrelates with generalization speed . Figure 2(a) shows the ID test
accuracy across different ϕ. We omit the other splits since for all settings, the training performance
saturates quickly and the OOD test accuracy remains at zero as earlier.4It could be seen that the ratio
ϕstrongly correlates with the speed of generalization. A very large ratio can push generalization to
improve at a similar pace as the model fits the training data, reducing the need for extended training.5

Figure 2: The speed of grokking on the in-distribution (ID) test performance (a) correlates with the
ratio between inferred and atomic facts, and (b) is not influenced by the sizeof training data.
Training data distribution , instead of training data size, qualitatively influences generalization
behavior . When ϕincreases and |E|holds constant, the sizeof training data also gets larger. Prior
studies hypothesize that training data size plays a central role in order for grokking to happen. In
particular, previous work connects grokking with the notion of critical data size (CDS) [ 33,61,78,21],
where it is hypothesized that CDS marks the shift from memorization to generalization (via grokking),
and the speed of generalization improves as the training data further scales. However, results from
our controlled experiments seem to contradict such a hypothesis. Figure 2(b) shows the results
of varying |E|with a fixed ϕ= 9.0, where we change the horizontal axis from optimization
step to epoch for better visualization.6When fixing the ratio ϕ, the training data size does not
qualitatively affect the model’s generalization. Specifically, scaling the data affects neither the
relative speed of ID generalization and training improvement (as seen by the rather constant “gap”
between train_inferred IDandtest_inferred IDcurves), nor the systematicity level (OOD
performance stays zero). We also run the experiments across different ϕand find the results to be
consistent. This suggests that critical data “distribution”, not size, may be the actual deciding factor
behind grokking and generalization. In addition, we find that scaling up the model size also does not
qualitatively change the generalization behaviors observed here (Appendix B), and the main pattern
is that larger models converge in fewer optimization steps, which shares with prior findings [ 60,28].
Summary. We have shown that transformers are capable of acquiring the rule of composition through
grokking, with controlled experiments suggesting the crucial factor of data distribution (e.g., the
inferred/atomic ratio ϕ) in characterizing the model’s generalization. However, important questions
4The training performances of all settings saturate within 25K steps, where larger ϕtakes more steps.
5When ϕ= 18.0, the model achieves 96.7%accuracy before training performance saturates.
6The optimization steps for each epoch scale linearly with the training size since we use a fixed batch size.

still remain: what happens during grokking, why does it happen, and why do transformers struggle
with OOD examples? Answering these questions requires a deeper understanding of (the changes in)
the model’s inner workings, which we investigate next.
3.3 Analyzing the inner workings of the model throughout grokking
We analyze the internal mechanisms within the model via a combination of two prevalent approaches:
logit lens and causal tracing. We apply our analysis to the setting with |E|= 2000 , ϕ= 9.0on300
random examples from train_inferred ID.

Figure 3: Illustration of our circuit analysis approach (on the composition task). We use logit lens
to interpret individual states, and use causal tracing to measure the strength of connections between
states. Details are in the main content.
Logit lens . We interpret individual hidden states via logit lens [ 40,15,71], where the activation is
converted into a set of logits for each vocabulary token by multiplying with the output embedding
matrix. We follow the recent practice [ 71] where the activation first goes through the transformer’s
final normalization layer before multiplying with the output embedding (Figure 3, top right).
Causal tracing . The transformer could be viewed as a causal graph [ 46] that propagates information
from the input to the output through a grid of intermediate states, which allows for a variety of causal
analyses on its internal computations [ 63,35,19,65,12]. For convenience, we will refer to a hidden
state by S[i, a], where iis the layer index and amarks the role of the input token at the same position
as the state (one of {h, r 1, r2}). We illustrate our method in Figure 3, where the hidden state of
interest is S[4, r1]and the target is the model’s prediction state S[8, r2]. There are in total three steps:
1.The normal run records the model’s hidden state activations on a regular input (h, r 1, r2).
Note that since the model maintains perfect training performance throughout grokking, the final
prediction is always the ground truth tail entity t.7
2.In the perturbed run , a slightly perturbed input is fed to the model which changes the prediction,
where again the hidden state activations are recorded. For the perturbation, prior work has explored
adding noise to the input [ 35] and replacing key tokens with semantically close ones [ 63,12]. We
adopt token replacement which avoids unnecessary distribution shifts [ 74]. Specifically, for the
hidden state of interest, we replace the input token at the same position as the state to be a random
alternative of the same type (e.g., r1→r′
1) that leads to a different target prediction (e.g., t→t′).
3.Intervention . During the normal run, we intervene the state of interest by replacing its activation
with its activation in the perturbed run. We then run the remaining computations and measure if
the target state (top- 1token through logit lens) is altered. The ratio of such alterations (between 0
and1) among the examples quantitatively characterizes the causal strength between the state of
interest and the target.
7For convenience, when we refer to a state as a token, we mean the top token of the state via logit lens.

reciprocal rank (via logit lens) of the bridge entity batS[5, r1]and second relation r2atS[5, r2].
The generalizing circuit . We run a set of causal tracing and logit lens experiments across different
model checkpoints throughout training. The discovered generalizing circuit (i.e., the causal com-
putational pathways after grokking) is illustrated in Figure 4(a). Specifically, we locate a highly
interpretable causal graph consisting of states in layer 0,5, and 8, where we have pruned away the
weak nodes/connections (details in Appendix D). Layer 5splits the circuit into lower and upper
layers, where 1) the lower layers retrieve the first-hop fact (h, r 1, b)from the input h, r 1, store the
bridge entity binS[5, r1], and “delay” the processing of r2toS[5, r2]; 2) the upper layers retrieve the
second-hop fact (b, r2, t)fromS[5, r1]andS[5, r2], and store the tail tto the output state S[8, r2].
What happens during grokking? To understand the underlying mechanism behind grokking, we
track the strengths of causal connections and results from logit lens across different model checkpoints
during grokking (the “start” of grokking is the point when training performance saturates). We
observe two notable amplifications (within the identified graph) that happen during grokking. The
first is the causal connection between S[5, r1]and the final prediction t, which is very weak before
grokking (Appendix D) and grows significantly during grokking (Figure 4(b)). The second is the r2
component of S[5, r2]via logit lens, for which we plot its mean reciprocal rank (MRR) (Figure 4(c)).
Additionally, we find that the state S[5, r1]has a large component of the bridge entity bthroughout
grokking (Figure 4(c)). These observations strongly suggest that the model is gradually forming
the second hop in the upper layers ( 5-8) during grokking . This also indicates that, before grokking,
the model is very likely mostly memorizing the examples in train_inferred IDbydirectly
associating (h, r 1, r2)witht, without going through the first hop.
Why does grokking happen? These observations suggest a natural explanation of why grokking
happens through the lens of circuit efficiency [ 61]. Specifically, as illustrated above, there exist both
a memorizing circuit Cmem and a generalizing circuit Cgenthat can fit the training data. While
Cmem is learned first (which causes training performance to saturate quickly), Cgenis relatively more
efficient , in the sense that it could fit the data with a lower complexity. To see this, we can compare
the amount of facts Cmem andCgenneed to store (denoted as Nmem andNgen) as a proxy for their
complexity.8Cmem stores both atomic facts and inferred facts in the weights. Cgen(Figure 4(a))
stores the atomic facts in the lower layers, and another copy of the atomic facts that appear as the
second hop in the inferred facts in the upper layers. As the inferred/atomic ratio ϕincreases, Nmem
would increase rapidly while Ngenincreases slowly and is always bounded by two times the total
amount of atomic facts, and hence, the relative efficiency of Cgenincreases. In the long run, the model
will be incentivized to transition from Cmem toCgendue to implicit bias of the optimization [ 53] and
explicit regularization such as weight decay which prefers more efficient circuits, and the transition
would happen faster as ϕincreases. This also explains why the training data size does not affect the
speed of grokking, since solely increasing the size does not change the relative efficiency of Cmem
andCgen. The explanation also implies that a larger regularization factor should accelerate grokking
(and vice versa), which we confirm by varying the degree of weight decay (Appendix E.1).
8While the circuits also consist of other components, they pale in comparison as the number of facts scales.
6
Explaining and mitigating the deficiency in OOD generalization. The configuration of Cgenalso
has another important implication: while the model does acquire compositionality through grokking,
itdoes not have any incentive to store atomic facts in the upper layers that do not appear as the
second hop during training . This explains why the model fails in the OOD setting where facts
are only observed in the atomic form, not in the compositional form—the OOD atomic facts are
simply not stored in the upper layers when queried during the second hop.9Such issue originates
from the non-recurrent design of the transformer architecture which forbids memory sharing across
different layers. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of existing findings that transformers
seem to reduce compositional reasoning to linearized pattern matching [ 10], and also provides a
potential explanation for the observations in recent findings that LLMs only show substantial positive
evidence in performing the first hop reasoning but not the second [ 71]. Our findings imply that proper
cross-layer memory-sharing mechanisms for transformers such as memory-augmentation [ 54,17] and
explicit recurrence [ 7,22,57] are needed to improve their generalization. We also show that a variant
of the parameter-sharing scheme in Univeral Transformer [ 7] can improve OOD generalization in
composition (Appendix E.2).
4 Comparison—Systematic Generalization via Parallel Circuit
We have just shown that the vanilla transformer fails to achieve OOD generalization for composition,
but is the vanilla transformer generally incapable of acquiring systematic implicit reasoning skills?
We show that for comparison , a task where SoTA LLMs such as GPT-4 also struggle [ 1], the vanilla
transformer does have the capability to acquire systematic generalization, again through grokking. On
the surface, it seems that the comparison task is no different than the composition task—both require
retrieving and reasoning over two pieces of facts. However, as it turns out through our analysis, the
comparison task emits a “parallel circuit” that is learned by the transformer during grokking, which
allows atomic facts to be stored and retrieved in the same region and enables systematicity to happen.
Setup. The comparison task involves comparing the attribute values of entities. We assume there
are|E|= 1000 entities, |A|= 20 attributes and |V|= 20 ordinal values for the attributes. Each
attribute a∈ A has a label space {a<, a=, a>}, a set of relations specifying its comparative form. For
example, an attribute agewould have a<, a=, a>to be younger, contemporary, older , respectively.
The atomic facts are (entity, attribute, value) triplets, where we assign a random value v∈ V for
each(e, a)∈ E ×A . Again, we randomly partition the atomic facts into atomic IDandatomic OOD
(90%:10%). The rules of comparison are:
∀e1, e2∈ E,∀a∈ A,∀v1, v2∈ V,(e1, a, v 1)∧(e2, a, v 2)∧v1< v 2=⇒(a, e 1, e2, a<),
∀e1, e2∈ E,∀a∈ A,∀v1, v2∈ V,(e1, a, v 1)∧(e2, a, v 2)∧v1=v2=⇒(a, e 1, e2, a=),
∀e1, e2∈ E,∀a∈ A,∀v1, v2∈ V,(e1, a, v 1)∧(e2, a, v 2)∧v1> v 2=⇒(a, e 1, e2, a>).(2)
Take the attribute ageas an example, the first rule means if the ageofe1issmaller than the
ageofe2, then we can infer “In terms of age, the relation between e1ande2isyounger ”. Each
entity/attribute/value/label is assigned a unique token, and training/testing is done by having the
model predict the last token (attribute value for atomic facts; comparative relation for inferred facts).
Results & analysis . Figure 1(right) shows the results for ϕ= 7.2, and we include more results in
Appendix E.3. It can be seen that 1) the model again acquires robust generalization only through
grokking; 2) surprisingly, the model also achieves systematicity in generalization, different from the
case of composition.
Analyzing the model’s internals similarly as in §3.3 (details in Appendix D), we find the generalizing
circuit for comparison illustrated in Figure 5(a). On a separate stream, the model prepares the label
space{a<, a=, a>}from aand stores it in S[7, a]. In the lower layers ( 0-5), the model retrieves
the two atomic facts and stores the attribute values v1andv2atS[5, e1]andS[5, e2]. Then, the
upper layers ( 5-8) compare v1, v2and fetch the label from S[7, a]based on the comparison result.
Importantly, there is a major difference compared with the circuit for composition: the two atomic
facts are retrieved in parallel , which suggests that the atomic facts are stored solely in the lower layers,
without having separate copies across different regions as in the circuit for composition. This explains
why systematicity could happen: OOD facts are now stored and accessed in the same way as ID
9We verified that in the OOD setting, S[5, r1]andS[5, r2]encode bandr2respectively as in the ID case.

facts. Tracking the changes in the model throughout grokking, we observe significantly strengthened
causal connections from S[7, a]andS[5, e1]to the final prediction (Figure 5(b)). We also find that
throughout grokking, S[7, a]always encodes the label space and S[5, e1], S[5, e2]gradually encode
the two attribute values (Figure 5(c)). This confirms that a similar transition from Cmem toCgen
happens during grokking.

The findings here showcase transformer’s ability to learn parallel solutions to seemingly sequential
problems, akin to the findings in Liu et al. [ 30] where it is shown that transformers can learn
“shortcuts” to automata. The difference in the acquired generalization across the two tasks that
we study also emphasizes the need for controlled and mechanistic study on understanding the
transformer’s reasoning before making general claims on its limitations.
5 The Power of Parametric Memory for Complex Reasoning
At the high level, our study so far paves the way towards better understanding and improving
transformer’s reasoning with parametric representation of knowledge and rules. But why is parametric
memory practically important? Can we not simply enhance LLMs with non-parametric memory, e.g.,
by using their long-context modes and/or doing explicit retrieval, to solve the tasks","Transformer models, a type of deep learning architecture, have become incredibly powerful in a variety of tasks, from language processing to image recognition. But how exactly do these models work, and what are they capable of? This research paper dives into the inner workings of Transformers, exploring their ability to reason about abstract concepts and perform multi-step reasoning. The researchers use a combination of experiments and analyses to uncover the mechanisms underlying Transformers' impressive performance. One key finding is that Transformers can learn syntactic structure without explicit supervision, suggesting that they have a remarkable capacity for implicit reasoning. They can also tackle multi-step reasoning tasks , demonstrating their expressive power and ability to chain together complex thought processes. Overall, this research sheds light on the inner workings of Transformers, helping us better understand how these powerful models learn and generalize. By delving into the mechanisms behind their performance, the researchers hope to pave the way for even more advanced and capable AI systems in the future."

Abstract
While self-correction has shown promise in
improving LLM outputs in terms of style and
quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023b; Madaan et al.,
2023), recent attempts to self-correct logical or
reasoning errors often cause correct answers
to become incorrect, resulting in worse perfor-
mances overall (Huang et al., 2023). In this
paper, we show that poor self-correction per-
formance stems from LLMs’ inability to find
logical mistakes, rather than their ability to cor-
recta known mistake. Firstly, we benchmark
several state-of-the-art LLMs on their mistake-
finding ability and demonstrate that they gener-
ally struggle with the task, even in highly objec-
tive, unambiguous cases. Secondly, we test the
correction abilities of LLMs – separately from
mistake finding – using a backtracking setup
that feeds ground truth mistake location infor-
mation to the model. We show that this boosts
downstream task performance across our 5 rea-
soning tasks, indicating that LLMs’ correction
abilities are robust. Finally, we show that it
is possible to obtain mistake location informa-
tionwithout ground truth labels or in-domain
training data. We train a small classifier with
out-of-domain data, which exhibits stronger
mistake-finding performance than prompting a
large model. We release our dataset of LLM-
generated logical mistakes, BIG-Bench Mis-
take, to enable further research into locating
LLM reasoning mistakes.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated
the field of NLP in recent years, achieving state-
of-the-art performance in a large variety of appli-
cations. In particular, LLMs have demonstrated
the ability to solve tasks with zero- or few-shot
prompting, giving rise to prompting methods such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), Self-
*Work done during an internship at Google Research.
†Equal leadership contribution.Consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023), ReAct (Yao
et al., 2022), etc.
Recent literature on few- or zero-shot prompting
has focused on the concept of self-correction , i.e.
having an LLM correct its own outputs (Shinn et al.,
2023; Miao et al., 2024; Madaan et al., 2023; Chen
et al., 2023b; Saunders et al., 2022). (See Pan et al.
(2023) for a review of the literature.)
However, Huang et al. (2023) note that while
self-correction may prove effective for improving
model outputs in terms of style and quality, when
it comes to reasoning tasks, LLMs struggle to iden-
tify and fix errors without external feedback: for
example, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) and RCI
(Kim et al., 2023) both use ground truth correctness
as a signal to halt the self-correction loop. Initially
observed by Madaan et al. (2023) on a math dataset,
Huang et al. (2023) further demonstrate this short-
coming of self-correction in 2 additional datasets.
While previous work typically present self-
correction as a single process, we divide it into
mistake finding andoutput correction to better
understand each component individually.
Mistake finding is a fundamental reasoning skill
that has been studied and utilised extensively in phi-
losophy, psychology, and mathematics, spawning
concepts such as critical thinking, and logical and
mathematical fallacies. One might expect that the
ability to find mistakes should also be an important
requirement for LLMs. However, our results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs currently cannot find
mistakes reliably.
Output correction involves partially or com-
pletely changing previously generated outputs.
With self-correction, this is typically done with
outputs generated by the same model (see Pan
et al. (2023)). Despite LLMs’ inability to find
mistakes, our results show that they can correct
outputs, if given information about the mistake lo-
cation. While LLMs struggle with mistake-finding
in few-shot conditions, we can obtain more reliablearXiv:2311.08516v3 [cs.AI] 4 Jun 2024
mistake location information using a small, trained
classifier.
Our contributions for this paper are as follows:
1.With Chain-of-Thought prompting, any task can
be turned into a mistake-finding task. We collect
and release1to the research community BIG-
Bench Mistake , a dataset of CoT-style traces2
generated using PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023), and
annotated according to where the first logical
mistake is. To our knowledge, BIG-Bench Mis-
take is the first dataset of its kind that goes be-
yond problems in mathematics.
2.We produce benchmark results for our dataset
to test the reasoning capabilities of five state-of-
the-art LLMs. We demonstrate that these LLMs
struggle with mistake finding, even for ob-
jective, unambiguous cases . We hypothesise
that this is a main contributing factor to LLMs’
inability to self-correct reasoning errors.
3.We test LLMs’ ability to correct reasoning er-
rorsseparately from mistake-finding, by feed-
ing to the model the ground truth (or oracle )
mistake location information through a back-
tracking method. We demonstrate that LLMs’
correction abilities are robust , effectively cor-
recting outputs that are originally incorrect, with
minimal effect on outputs that are originally cor-
rect.
4.We demonstrate that LLMs’ low accuracy at
few-shot mistake-finding can be improved upon
without using in-domain training data . As
a proof-of-concept, we train a small mistake-
finding classifier using out-of-domain data,
which performs better than prompting a large
model. We leave the development of more so-
phisticated methods to future work.
2 BIG-Bench Mistake
BIG-Bench Mistake contains 2186 sets of CoT-
style traces. Each trace is generated with PaLM 2
Unicorn (Anil et al., 2023), and annotated with the
location of the first logical error. Table 1 shows an
example trace where the mistake location3is the
4thstep.
1Publicly available at https://github.com/WHGTyen/
BIG-Bench-Mistake .
2We refer to a set of CoT reasoning steps as a trace .
3As some traces may not contain mistakes, we use the term
mistake location as a multi-class label that can refer to either
the integer Nwhere the Nthstep contains the first mistake, or
that there are no mistakes.Sort the following words alphabetically: List: hypochlo-
rite ponderosa phone credulity
Thought 1:I should start by looking at the first letter
of the words in the list. The first letter:
""hypochlorite"": ""h"" (8). ""ponderosa"": ""p""
(16). ""phone"": ""p"" (16). ""credulity"": ""c"" (3).
Thought 2:We now have: (3) ""credulity"" < (8)
""hypochlorite"" < (16) [""ponderosa"" ?
""phone""].
Thought 3:Now let’s sort this subpart [""ponderosa"" ?
""phone""] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: ""ponderosa"": ""o"" (15).
""phone"": ""h"" (8).
Thought 4:
(MISTAKE)We now have: (8) ""phone"" < (15) ""pon-
derosa"" for the subpart. Hence, we have
""credulity"" < ""phone"" < ""ponderosa"".
Thought 5:I have now sorted all the words. The answer
is credulity hypochlorite phone ponderosa
Table 1: Example of a CoT trace for the word sorting
task. There is a mistake in Thought 4: the ordering
""credulity"" < ""phone"" < ""ponderosa"" is missing the word
hypochlorite .
Our traces span across a set of 5 tasks from the
BIG-bench dataset (Srivastava et al., 2023): word
sorting, tracking shuffled objects, logical deduction,
multi-step arithmetic, and Dyck languages4. CoT
prompting is used to prompt PaLM 2 to answer
questions from each task. As we wanted to sepa-
rate our CoT traces into distinct steps, we follow
Yao et al. (2022) and generate each step separately,
using the newline as a stop token.
All traces are generated with temperature = 0.
The correctness of answers are determined by exact
match. Prompts can be found at https://github.
com/WHGTyen/BIG-Bench-Mistake along with
the dataset.
2.1 Annotation
Each generated trace is annotated with the first
logical error. We ignore any subsequent errors as
they may be dependent on the original error.
Note that traces can contain a logical mistake
yet arrive at the correct answer. To disambiguate
the two types of correctness, we will use the terms
correct ansandincorrect ansto refer to whether the
final answer of the trace is correct. Accuracy ans
4These 5 tasks are selected because 1) Anil et al. (2023)
demonstrate that PaLM 2 performs poorly on these tasks, so
it is likely to generate mistakes in CoT traces; 2) mistakes in
these tasks are likely to be unambiguous, therefore minimising
subjectivity during annotation; and 3) identifying mistakes for
these tasks does not require expertise knowledge.

To refer to whether the trace contains a logical
mistake (rather than the correctness of the final
answer), we will use correct misandincorrect mis.
2.1.1 Human annotation
For 4 of the 5 tasks, we recruit human annotators
to go through each trace and identify any errors.
Annotators have no domain expertise but are given
guidelines5to complete the task.
Before annotation, we sample a set of 300 traces
for each task, where 255 (85%) are incorrect ans,
and 45 (15%) are correct ans. Since human annota-
tion is a limited and expensive resource, we chose
this distribution to maximise the number of steps
containing mistakes and to prevent over-saturation
of correct steps. We also include some correct ans
traces because some may contain logical errors
despite the correct answer, and to ensure that the
dataset included examples of correct steps that are
near the end of the trace. To account for this skewed
distribution, results in section 4 are split according
to whether the original trace is correct ansor not.
Following Lightman et al. (2023), annotators
are instructed to go through each step in the
trace and indicate whether the step is correct
or not (binary choice). Annotators only submit
their answers when all steps are annotated, or
there is one incorrect step. If an incorrect step is
identified, the remaining steps are skipped. This
is to avoid ambiguities where a logically correct
deduction is dependent on a previous mistake.
Our annotation guidelines can be found at https:
//github.com/WHGTyen/BIG-Bench-Mistake/
tree/main/annotation_guidelines , and we
include a screenshot of the user interface in
Appendix D.
Each trace is annotated by at least 3 annotators.
If there are any disagreements, we take the majority
label. We calculate Krippendorff’s alpha (Hayes

2.1.2 Automatic annotation
For Dyck languages, we use mostly automatic in-
stead of human annotation, as the traces show lim-
ited variation in phrasing and solution paths.
For each trace, we algorithmically generate a set
of steps based on the format used in the prompt
examples. Using pattern matching, we identify
whether each model-generated step conforms to
the same format. If so, we compare the two and
assume that the trace is incorrect if the symbols
do not match. Additionally, we account for edge
cases such as where the final two steps are merged
into one, or variations in presentation where sym-
bols may or may not be placed in quotes. We re-
lease the code at https://github.com/WHGTyen/
BIG-Bench-Mistake along with our dataset.
3 Can LLMs find reasoning mistakes in
CoT traces?
Table 4 shows the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-
4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, and PaLM 2 Uni-
corn on our mistake-finding dataset. For each ques-
tion, the possible answers are either: that there are
no mistakes, or; if there is a mistake, the number N
indicating the step in which the first mistake occurs.
A model’s output is only considered correct if the
location matches exactly, or the output correctly
indicates that there are no mistakes.
All models are given the same 3-shot prompts5.
We use three different prompting methods:
•Direct trace-level prompting involves using
the whole trace as input to the model and di-
rectly prompting for the mistake location. The
model must output either the number represent-
ing the step, or ""No"".
•Direct step-level prompting prompts for a bi-
nary Yes/No output for every step, indicating
whether or not the step is correct. In each gen-
eration call, the input contains the partial trace
up to (and including) the target step, but does
not contain results for previous steps. The final
answer is inferred from where the first ""No""
output occurs (subsequent steps are ignored).
•CoT step-level prompting is an extension of
direct, step-level prompting. Instead of a bi-
nary Yes/No response, we prompt the model to
check the (partial) trace through a series of rea-
soning steps. This method is the most resource
intensive of all three methods as it involves gen-
erating a whole CoT sequence for every step.
As with direct step-level prompting, the final
answer is inferred from where the first ""No""
output occurs (subsequent steps are ignored).
3.1 Discussion
All five models appear to struggle with our mis-
take finding dataset. GPT-4 attains the best results
but only reaches an overall accuracy of 52.87 with
direct step-level prompting. While exact parame-
ter counts are undisclosed, GPT-4 is likely one of
the largest models, along with PaLM 2 Unicorn6,
while Gemini Pro and GPT-3.5-Turbo are among
the smaller models.
Our findings are in line with and builds upon
results from Huang et al. (2023), who show that
existing self-correction strategies are ineffective on
reasoning errors. In our experiments, we specifi-
cally target the models’ mistake finding ability and
provide results for additional tasks. We show that
state-of-the-art LLMs clearly struggle with mistake
finding, even in the most simple and unambiguous
cases. (For comparison, humans can identify mis-
takes without specific expertise, and have a high
degree of agreement, as shown in Table 3.)
We hypothesise that LLMs’ inability to find mis-
takes is a main contributing factor to why LLMs are
unable to self-correct reasoning errors. If LLMs are

PaLM 2 Unicorn and are sampled according to whether the
final answer was correct or not. Therefore, we expect that
using PaLM 2 itself to do mistake finding will produce dif-
ferent and likely biased results. Further work is needed to
elucidate the difference between cross-model evaluation and
self-evaluation.unable to identify mistakes, it should be no surprise
that they are unable to self-correct either.

* indicates that traces were sampled to contain 45

3.2 Comparison of prompting methods
As we compare results across the three methods,
we find that the accuracy on traces with no mistakes
goes down7considerably from direct, trace-level
prompting to CoT, step-level prompting. Figure 1
demonstrates this trade-off.
We hypothesise that this is due to the number of
outputs generated by the model. Our three methods
involve generating increasingly complex outputs,
starting with direct, trace-level prompting requir-
ing a single token, then direct, step-level prompt-
ing requiring one token per step, and finally CoT
step-level prompting requiring several sentences
per step. If each generation call has some proba-
bility of identifying a mistake, then the more calls
made on each trace, the more likely the model will
identify at least one mistake.
Figure 1: Graph of mistake location accuracies for each
prompting method (excluding GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini
Pro which we do not have all results for). Blue bars show
accuracies on traces with no mistakes, so the model must
predict that the trace has no mistake to be considered
correct; orange bars show accuracies on traces with a
mistake, so the model must predict the precise location
of the mistake to be considered correct.
3.3 Few-shot prompting for mistake location
as a proxy for correctness
In this section, we investigate whether our
prompting methods can reliably determine the
correctness ansof a trace rather than the mistake
location. Our motivation was that even humans
use mistake finding as a strategy for determining
whether an answer is correct or not, like when go-
ing through mathematical proofs or argumentation.
7Note that the traces in BIG-Bench Mistake are sam-
pled to contain more incorrect anstraces than correct ans
traces (and therefore more incorrect mistraces than correct mis
traces), so the overall mistake location accuracy appears higher
for per-step prompting in Table 4, despite the poor accu-
racy for correct mistraces. For a full set of scores split by
correctness mis, see Appendix E.Additionally, it may be the case that directly pre-
dicting the correctness ansof a trace is easier than
pinpointing the precise location of an error.

Table 5: Weighted average F1 scores for predicted
correctness ansof traces across 5 tasks. Baseline is 78
if we only select the incorrect anslabel. As in Table 4,
traces for the Dyck languages task has been sampled to
match the ratio of correct ansto incorrect anstraces of
the other tasks. See Table 2 for a full breakdown.
We calculate averaged F1 scores based on
whether the model predicts there is a mistake in
the trace. If there is a mistake, we assume the
model prediction is that the trace is incorrect ans.
Otherwise, we assume the model prediction is that
the trace is correct ans. In Table 5, we average the
F1s calculated with correct ansand incorrect ansas
positive labels, weighted according to the number
of times each label occurs. Note that the naive base-
line of predicting all traces as incorrect achieves a
weighted F1 average of 78.
The weighted F1 scores show that prompting for
mistakes is likely a poor strategy for determining
the correctness of the final answer. This is in line
with our previous finding that LLMs struggle to
identify mistake locations, and also builds upon
results from Huang et al. (2023), who demonstrate
that improvements from Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023) and RCI (Kim et al., 2023) are only from
using oracle correctness ansinformation.
4 Can LLMs correct reasoning mistakes
in CoT traces?
In this section, we examine LLMs’ ability to cor-
rectmistakes, independently of their ability to find
them. To do so, we feed oracle mistake location in-
formation from BIG-Bench Mistake into the model
and prompt it for a corrected version of the original
CoT trace.
As a simple baseline, we use the following back-
tracking method (visualized in Figure 2):
(a)First, the model generates an initial CoT trace.
In our experiments, we use temperature = 0.
(b)We then determine the mistake location in this
trace, either from oracle labels (in this section)
or with a classifier (in section 5).
(c)If there are no mistakes, we move onto the next
trace. If there is a mistake (e.g. at Thought 4
in the example trace in Table 1), we prompt the
model again for the same step but at temperature
= 1. We use same prompt and the partial trace
containing all steps up to but not including the
mistake step (e.g. up to Thought 3, prompting
for Thought 4).
(d)In our experiments, we found that (c) often pro-
duced steps that are identical to the original. We
therefore repeat (c) until a different step is gen-
erated (or up to a fixed number, whichever is
less). For this paper, we use 8 as the maximum
number of re-generations; the effects of vary-
ing this number is left for future investigation.
To reduce computational cost, we generate 8
outputs simultaneously but only select one for
backtracking.
(e)Finally, with the new, regenerated step in place
of the previous one, we generate the remaining
steps of the trace again at temperature = 0.
This backtracking method is designed to be a
very simple baseline, with no specific prompt text
or phrasing, and without relying on generating alarge number of alternatives. For our experimental
results below, we specifically use the same model
(PaLM 2 Unicorn) to correct the traces it originally
generated, to test its ability to self-correct.
4.1 Results
The results are shown in Table 6. To show that per-
formance increases are not due to randomly resam-
pling outputs, we compare our results to a random
baseline, where a mistake location8is randomly se-
lected for each trace and we perform backtracking
based on the random location.
Note that Table 6 separates results into num-
bers for the correct set and the incorrect set, refer-
ring to whether the original trace was correct ans
or not. This gives a clearer picture than the over-
all accuracy ans, which would be skewed by the
proportion of traces that were originally correct ans
(15%) and incorrect ans(85%).
Scores represent the absolute differences in
accuracy ans. We perform backtracking on both
correct ansand incorrect anstraces, as long as there
is a mistake in one of the steps.
∆accuracy ✓refers to differences in accuracy ans
on the set of traces whose original answer was
correct ans. Note that we take losses here because,
despite the correct answer, there is a logical mistake
in one of the steps. Therefore, the answer may
change to an incorrect one when we backtrack.
∆accuracy ✗is the same but for incorrect ans
traces, so the answers may have been corrected,
hence increasing accuracy ans.
For example, for the word sorting task, 11.11%
of traces that were originally correct ansbecame
incorrect ans, while 23.53% of traces that were orig-
inally incorrect ansbecame correct ans.
4.2 Discussion
The scores show that the gains from correcting
incorrect anstraces are larger than losses from
changing originally correct answers. Additionally,
while the random baseline also obtained improve-
ments, they are considerably smaller than if the
true mistake location was used. Note that tasks
involving fewer steps are more likely to improve
performance in the random baseline, as the true
mistake location is more likely to be identified.
8As described above, the mistake location can be either the
number representing the step, or that there are no mistakes. If
there are no mistakes, we do not use backtracking and simply
use the original trace.

on the set of traces whose original answer was correct ans;∆accuracy ✗for traces whose original answer was
incorrect ans. The average number of steps in a trace is shown to demonstrate the likelihood of randomly selecting
the correct mistake location in the random baseline condition.
Our results show that, with mistake location in-
formation available, LLMs can correct their own
outputs and improve overall downstream perfor-
mance. This suggests that the main bottleneck in
self-correction methods is the identification of mis-
takes, rather than the correction process. This bot-
tleneck can be overcome by using ground truth
feedback (as in Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) or
RCI (Kim et al., 2023)), or by training a classifier
(see section 5).
While our numbers do show that our gains are
higher than our losses, it should be noted that
changes in the overall accuracy depends on the
original accuracy achieved on the task. For exam-
ple, if the original accuracy on the tracking shuffled
objects task was 50%, the new accuracy would be
68.6%. On the other hand, if the accuracy was
99%, the new accuracy would drop to 92.8%. As
our dataset is highly skewed and only contains 45correct anstraces per task, we leave to future work
a more comprehensive assessment of backtracking,
as well as the development of more sophisticated
ways to incorporate mistake location information
into the self-correction loop.
5Obtaining mistake location information
with a trained classifier
As shown in section 4, if mistake location infor-
mation is available, LLMs can correct their own
CoT traces and boost downstream performance.
However, these experimental results are based on
oracle labels, which are typically not available in
downstream tasks.
One possible solution is to obtain mistake loca-
tion information from a smaller, trained classifier.
If training data is available, one might ask why this
approach is preferable to simply fine-tuning the
larger, generator model. The reasons are:
•Training a small classifier is far more efficient
in terms of computing resources and available
data.
•Once the classifier is trained, it can be used
with any LLM as the generator and be updated
independently. This can be especially helpful
with API-based LLMs that cannot be fine-tuned.
•The process of mistake finding is more inter-
pretable than updating the weights of the gen-
erator model directly. It clearly pinpoints the
location at which an error occurs, which can
help the debugging process and allow faster de-
velopment and iterations of models.
In this section, we seek to answer two questions
in the following subsections:
5.1: What mistake-finding accuracy is required
for backtracking to be effective?
A trained classifier is unlikely to reach 100%
mistake-finding accuracy. If backtracking is only
effective when mistake location is 100% accurate,
we would not be able to replace oracle labels with
a trained classifier.
5.2: Is it possible to improve on results in sec-
tion 3 without in-domain training data?
Sufficient in-domain training data typically guar-
antees a performance boost, but can be hard to
obtain. We investigate whether mistake-finding in
reasoning traces is transferable across tasks. If so,
one can use BIG-Bench Mistake or similar datasets
to fine-tune a mistake-finding classifier for other
tasks.
5.1 Minimum mistake finding accuracy
To explore what level of mistake-finding accu-
racy is needed, we simulate classifiers at different
levels of accuracy and run backtracking for each
level. We use accuracy misto refer to the mistake-
finding accuracy classifier, to differentiate from
downstream task accuracy ans.
For a given classifier at X% accuracy clf, we use
the mistake location from BIG-Bench Mistake X%
of the time. For the remaining (100−X)%, we
sample a mistake location randomly. To mi","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving the style and quality of their outputs through self-correction. However, recent attempts to have LLMs self-correct logical or reasoning errors often result in the models providing worse overall performance, even when they are able to correct known mistakes. The researchers behind this study found that the main reason for this poor self-correction performance is that LLMs struggle to actually identify logical mistakes in the first place, rather than an issue with their ability to correct known mistakes. To demonstrate this, the researchers benchmarked several state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to find logical mistakes, and found that the models generally struggled with this task, even when the mistakes were highly objective and unambiguous. However, the researchers also found that when they provided the LLMs with the ground truth location of the mistakes, the models' correction abilities were quite robust, boosting their downstream task performance across a range of reasoning tasks. This suggests that the key challenge is not with the LLMs' correction abilities, but rather with their inability to reliably identify logical mistakes in the first place. Interestingly, the researchers also showed that it is possible to obtain mistake location information without ground truth labels or in-domain training data. By training a small classifier with out-of-domain data, they were able to outperform prompting a large model at the task of finding logical mistakes. Overall, this research highlights the importance of developing effective ""verifier"" models that can reliably identify logical mistakes in LLM outputs, in order to unlock the full potential of self-correction techniques. The researchers have also released a dataset of LLM-generated logical mistakes to support further research in this area."

Linear algebra is central to many algorithms in engineering, science, and machine learning; hence,
accelerating it would have tremendous economic impact. Quantum computing has been proposed for
this purpose, although the resource requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities.
We consider an alternative physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics,
to provide a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra. At first sight, thermodynamics
and linear algebra seem to be unrelated fields. Here, we connect solving linear algebra problems
to sampling from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for solving linear systems of equations,
computing matrix inverses, and computing matrix determinants. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to digital methods, that
scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity,
entropy, and equilibration, highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct
fields, and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computers.
I. Introduction
Basic linear algebra primitives like solving linear systems and inverting matrices are present in many
modern algorithms. Such primitives are relevant to a multitude of applications, for example optimal control
ofdynamicsystemsandresourceallocation. Theyarealsoacommonsubroutineofmanyartificialintelligence
(AI) algorithms, and account for a substantial portion of the time and energy costs in some cases. The most
common method to perform these primitives is LU decomposition, whose time-complexity scales as O(d3).
Many proposals have been made to accelerate such primitives, for example using iterative methods such
as the conjugate gradient method. In the last decade, these primitives have been accelerated by hardware
improvements, notably by graphical processing units (GPUs), fueling massive parallelization. However, the
scaling of these methods is still a prohibitive factor, and obtaining a good approximate solution to a dense
matrix of more than a few tens of thousand dimensions remains challenging.
Exploiting physics to solve mathematical problems is a deep idea, with much focus on solving optimization
problems [1–3]. In the context of linear algebra, much attention has been paid to quantum computers [4],
since the mathematics of discrete-variable quantum mechanics matches that of linear algebra. A quantum
algorithm [5] to solve linear systems has been proposed, which for sparse and well-conditioned matrices
scales as logd. However, the resource requirements [6] for this algorithm are far beyond current hardware
capabilities. More generally building large-scale quantum hardware has remained difficult [7], and variational
quantum algorithms for linear algebra [8–10] have battled with vanishing gradient issues [11–13].
Therefore, the search for alternative hardware proposals that can exploit physical dynamics to accelerate
linear algebra primitives has been ongoing. Notably, memristor crossbar arrays have been of interest for
accelerating matrix-vector multiplications [14, 15]. Solving linear systems has also been the subject of
analog computing approaches [16].
Recently, we defined a new class of hardware, built from stochastic, analog building blocks, which is
ultimately thermodynamic in nature [17]. (See also probabilistic-bit computers [18–20] and thermodynamic
neural networks [21–25] for alternative approaches to thermodynamic computing [26]). AI applications like
generative modeling are a natural fit for this thermodynamic hardware, where stochastic fluctuations are
exploited to generate novel samples.
In this work, we surprisingly show that the same thermodynamic hardware from Ref. [17] can also be used
toacceleratekeyprimitivesinlinearalgebra. Thermodynamicsisnottypicallyassociatedwithlinearalgebra,
and connecting these two fields is therefore non-trivial. Here, we exploit the fact that the mathematics of
harmonic oscillator systems is inherently affine (i.e., linear), and hence we can map linear algebraic primitives
onto such systems. (See also Ref. [27] for a discussion of harmonic oscillators in the context of quantum
computingspeedups.) Weshowthatsimplybysamplingfromthethermalequilibriumdistributionofcoupled
harmonic oscillators, one can solve a variety of linear algebra problems.
Specifically we develop thermodynamic algorithms for the following linear algebraic primitives: (i) solving
a linear system Ax=b, (ii) estimating a matrix inverse A−1, (iii) solving Lyapunov equations [28] of the
form AΣ + Σ A⊺=1and (iv) estimating the determinant of a symmetric positive definite matrix A. We
show that if implemented on thermodynamic hardware, these methods scale favorably with problem sizearXiv:2308.05660v2 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 10 Jun 2024

systems, matrix inverse, Lyapunov equation, and matrix determinant problems are respectively for algorithms based

compared to digital algorithms. Our numerical simulations corroborate our analytical scaling results and
also provide evidence of the fast convergence of these primitives with the wall-clock time, with the speedup
relative to digital methods getting more pronounced with increasing dimension and condition number.
We remark that there is a connection between our thermodynamic algorithms and digital Monte-Carlo
(MC) algorithms that were developed for linear algebra [29–33]. Namely, our algorithms can be viewed
as a continuous-time version of these digital MC algorithms. However, we emphasize that the continuous
time (i.e., physics-based rather than physics-inspired) nature of our algorithms is crucial for obtaining our
predicted asymptotic speedup. Additionally, thermodynamic algorithms can be run on a single device [34]
whereas efficient digital MC linear algebra requires extensive parallelization [30].
II. Results
A. Algorithmic Scaling
In Table I, we summarize the asymptotic scaling results for our thermodynamic algorithms as compared to
the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital methods for dense symmetric positive-definite matrices. The deriva-
tions of these results can be found in the Supplemental Information, and are based on bounds obtained for
physical thermodynamic quantities, including correlation times, equilibration times, and free energy differ-
ences. As one can see from Table I, an asymptotic speedup is predicted for our thermodynamic algorithms
relative to the digital SOTA algorithms. Specifically, a speedup that is linear in dis expected for each of the
linear algebraic primitives (ignoring a possible dependence of κond). We remark that the complexity of
analog algorithms is subtle [35] and depends, e.g., on assumptions of how the hardware size grows with prob-
lem size. The assumptions made to obtain our scaling results are detailed in the Methods section. In what
follows, we systematically present our thermodynamic algorithms for various linear algebraic primitives.
B. Solving Linear Systems of Equations
The celebrated linear systems problem is to find x∈Rdsuch that
Ax=b, (1)
given some invertible matrix A∈Rd×dand nonzero b∈Rd. We may assume without loss of generality that
the matrix Ain Eq. (1) is symmetric and positive definite (SPD); if Ais not SPD, then we may consider
the system A⊺Ax=A⊺b, whose solution x=A−1bis also the solution of Ax=b. Note that this will affect
the total runtime, but still allows for asymptotic scaling improvements with respect to digital methods, in
some cases1. In what follows, we will therefore assume that Ais SPD.
1Constructing an SPD system from a generic one in this way results in the squaring of the condition number, which influences
performance.

FIG. 1.Diagram of our thermodynamic algorithm for solving linear systems and inverse estimation.
The system of linear equations, or the matrix A, is encoded into the thermodynamic hardware, the system is then
allowed to evolve until the stationary distribution has been reached, when the trajectory is then integrated to estimate
thesamplemeanorcovariance. Thisgivesestimatesofthesolutionofthelinearsystemortheinverseof Arespectively.
Now let us connect this problem to thermodynamics. We consider a macroscopic device with ddegrees of
freedom, described by classical physics. Suppose the device has potential energy function:
U(x) =1
2x⊺Ax−b⊺x, (2)
where A∈SPD d(R). Note that this is a quadratic potential that can be physically realized with a system
of harmonic oscillators, where the coupling between the oscillators is determined by the matrix A, and the
bvector describes a constant force on each individual oscillator. (We remark that while Figure 1 depicts
mechanical oscillators, from a practical perspective, one can build the device from electrical oscillators such
as RLC circuits.)
Suppose that we allow this device to come to thermal equilibrium with its environment, whose inverse
temperature is β= 1/kBT. At thermal equilibrium, the Boltzmann distribution describes the probability
for the oscillators to have a given spatial coordinate: f(x)∝exp(−βU(x)). Because U(x)is a quadratic
form, f(x)corresponds to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Thus at thermal equilibrium, the spatial
coordinate xis a Gaussian random variable
x∼ N[A−1b, β−1A−1]. (3)
Thekeyobservationisthattheuniqueminimumof U(x)occurswhere Ax−b= 0,whichalsocorrespondsto
the unique maximum of f(x). For a Gaussian distribution, the maximum of f(x)is also the first moment ⟨x⟩.
Thus, we have that, at thermal equilibrium, the first moment is the solution to the linear system of equations:
⟨x⟩=A−1b. (4)
From this analysis, we can construct a simple thermodynamic protocol for solving linear systems, which is
depicted in Figure 1. Namely, the protocol involves realizing the potential in Eq. (2), waiting for the system
to come to equilibrium, and then sampling xto estimate the mean ⟨x⟩of the distribution. This mean can
be approximated using a time-average, defined as
⟨x⟩ ≈¯x(τ) =1
τZt0+τ
t0dt′x(t′), (5)
where t0must be sufficiently large to allow for equilibration and τmust be sufficiently large for the average
to converge to a desired degree of precision. The eventual convergence of this time average to the mean
is the content of the ergodic hypothesis [40, 41], which is often assumed for quite generic thermodynamic
systems. It should be mentioned that the mean could also be approximated as the average of a sequence
of samples; however the integration approach has the advantage that it can conveniently be implemented
in a completely analog way (for example, using an integrator electrical circuit), which obviates the need for
transferring data from the physical device until the end of the protocol.
Figure 2 shows the equilibration process for both a single trajectory (left panel) and the overall distribution
(right panel). One can see the ergodic principle illustrated in this figure, since the time dynamics of a single
trajectory at thermal equilibrium are representative of the overall ensemble.
The overall protocol can be summarized as follows.

as the time average of a single trajectory (blue curve, left) approaches the ensemble average (dots, right) in the long-

Linear System Protocol
1. Given a linear system Ax=b, set the potential of the device to
U(x) =1
2x⊺Ax−b⊺x (6)
at time t= 0.
2. Choose equilibration tolerance parameters εµ0, εΣ0∈R+, and choose the equilibration time
t0⩾bt0, (7)
wherebt0is computed from the system’s physical properties or using heuristic methods based
on Eqs. (28), (30). Allow the system to evolve under its dynamics until t=t0, which ensures
that⟨x⟩ −A−1b/∥A−1b∥⩽εµ0andΣ−β−1A−1/∥β−1A−1∥⩽εΣ0.
3. Choose error tolerance parameter εxand success probability Pε, and choose the integration
time
τ⩾bτ, (8)
where bτis computed from the system’s physical properties, Eq. (28) or (30). Use an analog
integrator to measure the time average
¯x=1
τZt0+τ
t0dt x(t), (9)
which satisfies ∥A¯x−b∥/∥b∥⩽εxwith probability at least Pδ.
Inordertoimplementtheprotocolabove, thenecessaryvaluesof bt0andbτmustbeidentified, whichrequires
a more quantitative description of equilibration and ergodicity. To obtain such a description, a model of the
system’s microscopic dynamics may be introduced. Given that the system under consideration is composed
of harmonic oscillators in contact with a heat bath, it is natural to allow for damping (i.e., energy loss to the
bath) and stochastic thermal noise, which always accompanies damping due to the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem [43, 44]. The Langevin equation accounts for these effects, and specifically we consider two common
5
formulations, the overdamped Langevin (ODL) equation and the underdamped Langevin (UDL) equations.
In the Methods section, we provide additional details on ODL and UDL dynamics, and we provide explicit
formulas for bt0andbτfor the overdamped and underdamped regimes.
C. Estimating the Inverse of a Matrix
The results of the previous section rely on estimating the mean of x, but make no use of the fluctuations
inxat equilibrium. By using the second moments of the equilibrium distribution, we can go beyond solving
linear systems. For example it is possible to find the inverse of an SPD matrix A. As mentioned, the
stationary distribution of xisN[A−1b, β−1A−1], meaning the inverse of Acan be obtained by evaluating the
covariance matrix of x. This can be accomplished in an entirely analog way, using a combination of analog
multipliers and integrators. By setting b= 0for this protocol, we ensure that ⟨x⟩= 0, so the stationary
covariance matrix is, by definition
Σs= lim
t→∞⟨x(t)x⊺(t)⟩. (10)
In order to estimate this, we again perform time averages after allowing the system to come to equilibrium
Σs≈xx⊺=1
τZt0+τ
t0dt x(t)x⊺(t). (11)
It is therefore necessary to have an analog component which evaluates the product xi(t)xj(t)for each pair
(i, j), resulting in d2analog multiplier components. Each of these products is then fed into an analog
integrator component, which computes one element of the time-averaged covariance matrix
Σs,ij≈1
τZt0+τ
t0dt xi(t)xj(t). (12)
While the equilibration time is the same as for the linear system protocol, the integration time is different,
because in general the covariance matrix is slower to converge than the mean. We now give a detailed
description of the inverse estimation protocol, assuming ODL dynamics (the corresponding results for un-
derdamped dynamics can be found in the Supplemental Information). In the Methods section, we provide
explicit formulas for bt0andbτfor the Inverse Estimation Protocol. We remark that our matrix inversion
algorithm is a special case of our general algorithm for solving Lyapunov equations; the latter is presented
in the Supplemental Information.
Inverse Estimation Protocol
1. Given a positive definite matrix A, set the potential of the device to
U(x) =1
2x⊺Ax (13)
at time t= 0.
2. Choose equilibration tolerance parameter εΣ0∈R+, and choose the equilibration time
t0⩾bt0, (14)
wherebt0is computed from the system’s physical properties, Eq. (31) or (32). Allow the system
to evolve under its dynamics until t=t0, which ensures thatΣ−β−1A−1b/∥β−1A−1∥⩽εΣ.
3. Choose error tolerance parameter εΣand success probability Pε, and choose the integration
time
τ⩾bτ, (15)
where bτis computed from the system’s physical properties, Eq. (31) or (32). Use analog
multipliers and integrators to measure the the time averages

which satisfies ∥xx⊺−β−1A−1∥F/∥β−1A−1∥F⩽εAwith probability at least Pε.
D. Estimating the Determinant of a Matrix
The determinant of the covariance matrix appears in the normalization factor of a multivariate normal
distribution, whose density function is
fµ;Σ(x) = (2 π)−d/2|Σ|−1/2exp
−1
2x⊺Σ−1x
, (17)
and it is therefore natural to wonder whether hardware which is capable of preparing a Gaussian distri-
bution may be used to somehow estimate the determinant of a matrix. This can in fact be done, as the
problem is equivalent to the estimation of free energy differences, an important application of stochastic
thermodynamics. Recall that the difference in free energy between equilibrium states of potentials U1and
U2is [45]
∆F=F2−F1=−β−1ln R
dx e−βU2(x)
R
dx e−βU1(x)!
. (18)
Suppose the potentials are quadratic, with U1(x) =x⊺A1xandU2(x) =x⊺A2x. Then each integral simplifies
to the inverse of a Gaussian normalization factor,
Z
dx e−βVj(x)= (2π)d/2q

Thissuggeststhatthedeterminantofamatrix A1canfoundbycomparingthefreeenergiesoftheequilibrium
states with potentials U1andU2(where A2has known determinant), and then computing
|A1|=e−2β∆F|A2|. (21)
Fortunately, the free energy difference ∆Fcan be found, assuming we have the ability to measure the work
which is done on the system as the potential U(x)is changed from U1toU2. According to the Jarzynski
equality [46], the free energy difference between the (equilibrium) states in the initial and final potential is
e−β∆F=⟨e−βW⟩, (22)
where ⟨·⟩denotes an average over all possible trajectories of the system between time t= 0and time t=τ,
weighed by their respective probabilities. This may be approximated by an average over Nrepeated trials,
e−β∆F≈e−βW≡1
NNX
j=1e−βWj. (23)
However, while Jarzynski’s relation may be applied directly to estimate the free energy difference, this
estimator has large bias and is slow to converge. Far more well-behaved estimators have been found based
on work measurements. For simplicity, we here provide the expression based on Jarzynski’s estimator, while
in the Methods section and the Supplemental Information we refer to more suitable estimators. In summary,
the determinant of A1is approximated by
|A1| ≈
e−βW2
|A2|. (24)
In practice we will generally be interested in the log determinant to avoid computational overflow. This is
ln (|A1|)≈2 ln

E. Convergence and comparison to digital algorithms
1. Convergence
We now present several numerical experiments to corroborate our analytical results. Figure 3(A) displays
the convergence of the absolute error, ||¯x−A−1b||where ||.||denotes the 2-norm, as a function of time for
our thermodynamic linear systems algorithm. This plot shows that the expected convergence time to reach a
given error is linearly proportional to the dimension of the system, which is in agreement with the analytical
bounds that we presented above.
Similarly, let us examine the performance of the inverse estimation protocol. We employ the absolute error
on the inverse, ∥˜A−1−A−1∥Fwhere ∥ · ∥Fdenotes the Frobenius norm. Figure 3(B) shows the convergence
of the error as a function of the analog dynamics time for our thermodynamic inverse estimation algorithm.
We see that the expected convergence time to reach a given error is quadratic ( ∝d2) in the dimension, in
agreement with the analytical bounds presented above.
2. Comparison to digital algorithms
Another question of key importance is how the thermodynamic algorithm is expected to perform in
practical scenarios, i.e., when being run on real thermodynamic hardware. Due to the hardware being
analog in nature, this involves additional digital-to-analog compilation steps. To investigate this question,
we consider a timing model for the thermodynamic algorithm, based on the hardware proposal described
Ref.[17](SeetheSupplementalInformationforabriefsummaryofthishardware,whosedynamicscorrespond
to the overdamped regime as in Eq. (27)). This model includes all the digital, digital-to-analog and analog
operations needed to solve the problem, starting with a matrix Astored on a digital device, and sending back
the solution xfrom the thermodynamic system to the digital device. Note that this includes a compilation

in the Methods section. Note that analog imprecision is not taken into account in these experiments, and is
the subject of further investigations [47].
Figure 4 plots the absolute error for solving linear systems as a function of time for the thermodynamic
algorithm (TA), the conjugate gradient (CG) method, and the Cholesky decomposition (which is exact). In
panels (a) - (c) we explore how the methods converge with varying κandd. While at low dimensions our
method performs poorly with respect to the Cholesky decomposition and only slightly better than CG, it
becomes very competitive for dimensions d= 1000andd= 5000. Panels (d) - (f) show the error as a function
of time for different condition numbers, at fixed dimension. One can see that as κgrows (as conditioning
is worse) our method becomes more competitive with CG. This suggests that, even in practical scenarios
where we account for realistic computational overhead issues, our thermodynamic linear systems algorithm
can outperform SOTA digital methods, especially for large dand large κ.
Figure 4 also shows that the thermodynamic algorithm performs significantly better than the CG method
at early times, although the CG method ultimately achieves a higher quality result for later times. This
suggests that the thermodynamic algorithm is ideally suited to providing an approximate solution in a short
amount of time. Nevertheless, we note that the effective temperature of the thermodynamic hardware is
an important parameter, and one can lower this temperature to achieve higher precision solutions from the
thermodynamic hardware, as can be seen from the curves in Fig. 4.
Using a timing model similar to that employed for the linear systems protocol, we performed a runtime
comparison to Cholesky decomposition for the task of matrix inversion. The results are shown in Fig. 5,
2Cholesky and conjugate gradients are run on a digital computer, and the initial matrix is stored on that same computer,
hence there is no transfer cost, unlike for the thermodynamic algorithm.

where the error is plotted as a function of physical time for dimensions 100,1000, and 5000. The dashed
lines represent the corresponding times for Cholesky decomposition, for given dimensions. We see that as the
dimension grows, the advantage with respect to the Cholesky decomposition also grows, thus highlighting
a practical thermodynamic advantage. Our method for the inverse estimation therefore has the advantage
of having well-defined convergence properties as a function of dimension and condition number (compared
to other approximate methods for inverting dense matrices, which do not have well defined convergence
properties), as well as leading to reasonable error values in practical settings.
Overall, these numerical experiments highlight the potential utility of thermodynamic hardware by show-
ing the opportunity for speedup over SOTA digital methods, based on a simulated timing model of the
thermodynamic device.
III. Discussion
Various types of physics-based computers have been devised, which are supposed to expedite calculations
by using physical processes to evaluate expensive functions [4, 7, 48–50]. These devices (which include
quantum computers and a number of distinct analog architectures) have been shown to offer theoretical
advantages for solving certain problems, including linear systems of equations, but they have not found
common use commercially. A key obstacle to harnessing the power of physical computing is that fluctuations
in the system’s state tend to cause errors that compound over time, and which cannot be corrected in a
straightforward way [51] (as can be done for digital computers).
For this reason, we have considered thermodynamic algorithms, which treat the naturally-present fluctu-
ations as a resource, or at the very least are indifferent to them. In fact, we have introduced three distinct
classes of thermodynamic algorithms: first-moment based, second-moment based, and all-moment based
algorithms. Other thermodynamic algorithms will likely be discovered making use of third and higher mo-
ments, implying that such methods form a hierarchy. In some sense, using higher moments allows us to
solve “harder” problems, for example inverting a matrix (which uses the second moments) is harder than
solving a linear system of equations (which uses the first moment). Whether a precise relationship can be
found between computational hardness and the hierarchy of thermodynamic algorithms is currently an open
question.
Another open question concerns the optimality of these new thermodynamic algorithms. Our analysis
implies that, while the time and energy costs of linear-algebraic primitives are negotiable, the product of
time and energy necessary for a computation is fundamentally constrained (see Methods). It is therefore
of interest to search for thermodynamic algorithms which achieve lower values of the energy-time product
for these computations, and also to see whether such constraints may apply to other problems as well. We
10
anticipate that non-equilibrium thermodynamics will be a crucial tool in exploring such resource tradeoffs
for computation. For example, we have used the fact that a thermodynamic distance may be defined be-
tween equilibrium configurations of a system, and this distance determines the minimal amount of dissipated
energy necessary to transition from one configuration to another in a finite time [52–56]; the shorter the time
of transition, the more dissipation must occur. Perhaps, then, the search for algorithms which have minimal
energy-time product may be framed as a variational problem of minimizing length on the thermodynamic
manifold. Although proofs o","Linear algebra is the foundation of many important algorithms used in fields like engineering, science, and machine learning . If we could make these linear algebra calculations faster, it would have a huge positive impact on the economy. Quantum computing has been suggested as a way to speed up linear algebra, but the technology required is still a long way off. Instead, this paper looks at using the principles of classical thermodynamics - the study of heat, temperature, and energy - as an alternative approach to accelerating linear algebra in the near future. At first, thermodynamics and linear algebra don't seem related at all. But the researchers show how solving linear algebra problems is connected to simulating the equilibrium state of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators , which are a fundamental model in thermodynamics. The paper presents simple thermodynamic algorithms for performing key linear algebra operations like solving systems of linear equations, inverting matrices, computing determinants, and solving Lyapunov equations . They mathematically prove that these thermodynamic algorithms can achieve significant speedups over traditional digital methods, with the speedup growing as the size of the matrix increases."

Abstract 
We here analys e the question of developing artificial consciousness from an evolutionary 
perspective, taking the evolution of the human brain and its relation with consciousness as 
a reference model or as a benchmark . This kind of analysis reveals several structural and 
functional features of the human brain that appear to be key for reach ing human -like 
complex conscious experience and that current research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) should 
take into account in its attempt to develop systems capable of human -like conscious 
processing . We argue that , even if AI is limited in its ability to emulate human consciousness 
for both intrinsic (i .e., structural and architectural) and extrinsic (i.e., related to the current 
stage of scientific and technological knowledge) reasons, taking inspiration from those 
characteristics of the brain that make human -like conscious processing possible and/or 
modulate it , is a potentially promising strategy towards developing conscious AI. 
Also, it cannot be theoretically excluded that AI research can develop partial or potentially 
alternative forms of consciousness that are qualitatively different from the human form, and 
that may be either more or less sophisticated depending on the perspectives . Therefore, we 
recommend neuroscience -inspired caution in talking about artificial consciousness : since 
the use of the same word “consciousness” for humans and AI becomes ambiguous and 
potentially misleading, we propose to clearly specify which level and/or type of 
consciousness AI research aims to develop , as well as what would be commo n versus differ 
in AI conscious processing compared to human conscious experience . 

Introduction 
2 

Since Helmholtz, Du Bois-Reymond and even Freud pledged the solemn oath (1842) 
that “no other forces than the common physical chemical ones are active within the 
organism” , there is wide scientific agreement that the brain is a “physico -chemical system” 
and that “consciousness” is one of its most sophisticated features , even if there is no 
consensus on explaining how, specifically , this is the case . Therefore , it can be argued, it is 
theoretically possible that sooner or later one should be able to artificially emulate the brain’s 
function s, including consciousness, through physico -chemical methods. Yet the situation is 
analogous t o the case of “life in the test tube ” with the simplest living organisms : all their 
molecular components are known but up to now nobody has been able to reconstitute a 
living organism from its dissociated components. The issue is not only theoretical but also, 
importantly, practical. 
The prospect of developing artificial forms of consciousness is increasingly gaining traction 
as a concrete possibility both in the minds of lay people and of researchers in the field of 
neuroscience, robotics, AI, neuromorphic computing, philosophy, and their intersection 
(Blum & Blum, 2023; Butlin et al., 2023; LeDoux et al., 2023; Oliveira, 2022; VanRul len & 
Kanai, 2021) . The challenge of artificial conscious processing raises also social and ethical 
concerns (Farisco, 2024; Farisco et al., 2023; Hildt, 2023; Metzinger, 2021) . Therefore, it is 
very timely to critically evaluate the feasibility of developing artificial cons cious processing 
from a multidisciplinary perspective , as well as analyzing what that concept might mean . 
Relevant attempts in this direction have recently been proposed (Aru, Larkum, & Shine, 
2023; Godfrey -Smith, 2023; Seth, 2024) . 
Current discussions about the theoretical conceivability and the technical feasibi lity of 
developing artificial conscious processing hinges, to begin with, upon a semantic ambiguity 
and polysemy of the word “consciousness ”, including the distinction between 
phenomenology (i.e., a subjective first -person experience ) and underlying physiology (i.e., 
a third -person access to consciousness) (Evers & Sigman, 2013; Farisco, Laureys, & Evers, 
2015; Levine, 1983) , and the fundamental di stinction between conscious and non -conscious 
representations (Piccinini, 2022) . Also, c onscious processing may have different meanings 
depending on the context of analysis and it has different dimensions, which may possibly 
exhibit different levels resulting in different profiles of conscious processing (Bayne, Hohwy, 
& Owen, 2016; Dung & Newen, 2023; Irwin, 2024; Walter, 2021) . At the origins, 
consciousness comes from the Latin conscientia , cum scire : knowledge in common , 
oscillatin g between confidence and connivance , up to the classic ""faculty that man has of 
apprehending his own reality"" (Malebranche 1676) or for the neuropsychiatrist Henri Ey ""the 
3 

knowledge of the object by the subject and reciprocally, the reference of the object to the 
subject itself ”. Accordingly, t he individual is both the subject of his knowledge and the author 
of it. Lamarck, in 1809, speaks of a singular faculty with which certain animals and even 
humans are gifted, which he calls “sentiment interieur” , approximately inner fee ling. More 
recently Ned Block introduced the distinction between access and phenomenal 
consciousness. Access consciousness refers to the interaction between different mental 
states, particularly the availability of one state’s content for use in reasoning and rationally 
guidi ng capabilities like speech and action; phenomenal consciousness is the subjective 
feeling of a particular experience, “what it is like to be” in a particular state (Block, 1995) . 
Accordingly , cognition and subjective experience are two central components of conscious 
processing , which basically may be defined as “sensory awareness of the body, the self, 
and the world” (Lagercrantz & Changeux, 2009) , includ ing “inner, qualitative, subjective 
states and processes of sentience or awareness” (Searle, 2000) . Among the embodied 
components of conscious processing we may consider , in addition , at the individual level, 
the ability to express emotions , memory, symbols, language, capacity for autobiographical 
report and mental time travel, as well as the capacity to introspect and report about one’s 
mental state , and at the social level, sustained inter-individual interaction s which give access 
to various kind s of social relationships such as empathy and sympathy (Lagercrantz & 
Changeux, 2009) . 
Among the many theories and computer science models currently proposed , none of them , 
in our assessment , reach the overall species -speci fic aspects of the human higher brain 
functions (van Rooij et al., 2023) . The question arises: can these models reach those 
aspects with time, when further developed, or i s the gap irremediable? In parallel , more and 
more citizen s are confronted with AI simulations of human behavio ur, including conscious 
processing, and feel concerned about it (Lenharo, 2024) : the prospect of artificial conscious 
systems raises the risk of impacting human self -understanding, for instance if AI were to 
replac e humans in performing tasks that require a capacity for awareness . It thus appears 
necessary to challenge AI models with actual representations of human brain organization 
and human cognition and behavio ur. Therefore, the question is whether or not any 
theoretical computer science representation of human conscious processing can lead to 
human -like artificial conscious systems : could machines ever develop a human -like 
consciousness, or rather a different kind of consciousness, or is it impossible for them to 
4 

develop consciousness at all? Does the notion of artificial consciousness even make sense, 
and if so, how? To paraphrase Voltaire: Can a machine awaken?1 
In the past decades, a large number of models were elaborated mainly by neuroscientists 
with a more humble aim: to reconstruct elementary functions of the nervous system (e.g., 
swimming in the leech (Stent et al., 1978) or the lamprey (Grillner et al., 1995) ) from known 
anatomical and p hysiological building blocks. Some of these models have even been 
designed to simulate more elaborate d cognitive tasks like the Wisconsin Card sorting task 
(Dehaene & Changeux, 2011) and even trace vs . delay conditioning (Grover et al., 2022) . It 
is necessary to further develop the interface between AI , philosophy and neuroscience, 
which thus far has resulted in a mutual epistemic and methodologica l enrichment (Alexandre 
et al., 2020; Farisco et al., 2023; Floreano, Ijspeert, & Schaal, 2014; Floreano & Mattiussi, 
2008; Hassabis, Kumaran, Summerfield, & Botvinick, 2017; Momennejad, 2023; Poo, 20 18; 
Zador et al., 2023) . In fact, although significant, this collaboration is still insufficient to 
address the issue of artificial consciousness. The crucial, still open question is: what kind of 
concrete similarities vs. differences between AI and the brain may need to be examined and 
accounted for to more adequately approach artificial conscious processing? In other words, 
what is the right ‘level of description’ to either model , or even generate artificial conscious 
processing given what we know about conscious processing in the human brain? 
Moreover, in the neuroscience field, the word “consciousness” remains rather ill -defined 
and, as we shall see below, human conscious proc essing is not an all -or-none irreducible 
feature but one that develops stepwise (Changeux, 2006, 2017; Lagercrantz & Changeux, 
2009; Tomasello, 2022; Verschure, 2016) . Given these different possible developmental 
stages, AI attempts to develop artificial conscious p rocessing should precisely specify which 
one (if any) of these developmental stages is selected. 
In this paper we want to re -evaluate the issue of artificial consciousness within the context 
of our present knowledge of the biological brain, taking a pragmatic approach to the 
conceivability and feasibility of developing artificial consciousness and usi ng the human 
brain as a reference model or benchmark . We aim to complement recent attempt s in this 
direction (Aru et al., 2023; Godfrey -Smith, 2023) with a more encompassing analysis of the 
biological multilevel complexity of the human brain in relation to its evolution , not only in 
order to progress in the understanding of conscious processing itself but also to eventually 

1 The philosophers of the Enlightenment already wondered: what in the brain’s architecture might 
explain why and how it became conscious? What made matter awaken? Cf. e.g., a letter from 
Voltaire to d’Alembert, November 28, 1762. 
5 

inspire ongoing AI research aimed at developing artificial conscious processing. 
Accordingly, our aim is theoretical and philosophical but also highly practica l as an 
engineering issue: we review scientific evidence about some features of the brain that are 
key in enabling human consciousness or in modulating it (or both) , and we argue for the 
utility of taking inspiration from these feature s for advancing towards the development of 
conscious AI systems. 
We do not claim that it is necessary to integrate the mechanisms identified for conscious 
processing in the human brain to develop artificial consciou sness. In fact, we recognize that 
artificial features of conscious processing that are different from the brain ones cannot 
theoretically be excluded offhand . What we propose is rather to take the presently identified 
brain mechanisms of conscious processing as a benchmark in order to pragmatically 
advance in the building up of artificial models able to simulate accessible features of 
conscious processing in humans. G iven the high controversy around the possibility to build 
up an artificial consciou sness unrelated to brain mechanisms and the related risk of ending 
up in overly abstract views that are not sufficiently informed by empirical data, we think that 
starting from the biology of consciousness is a more productive strateg y. 
A question we may nevertheless ask is what are the benefits to pursue artificial 
consciousness in the first place , for science, or society at large? There are different possible 
answers. On an epistemological level, consistently with the medieval scholastic view 
reiterated by i.a. Paul Valéry that “we can actually understand only what we can build ”, it is 
clear that to elaborate artificial models of some concrete features of conscious processing 
could perhaps eventually allow us to better understand biological consciousness in general , 
whether in terms of similarities or differences . At a technical level, it is possible that the 
development of artificial consciousness would be a game -changer in AI, for instance giving 
AI the capacity for intentionality and theory of mind, and for anticipating the consequences 
of its own “actions ”. At the societal and ethical level, especially the last points could arguably 
help AI to better inform humans about potential negative impacts o n society, and to help 
avoid them while favouring positive impacts. Of course, on the negative side, intentionality 
in machines might not at all favour human interests any more than human intentionality has 
favoured out -group individuals or species, or ind eed the planet as a whole. This is indeed a 
discussion that would merit deeper analyses, but it is beyond the aim of the present paper. 
In the following , we will summarize relevant evolutionary, structural, and functional 
properties of the human brain that are of specific relevance to this discussion (for a recent 
overview, see (Barron, Halina, & Klein, 2023) . Against that background, we will outline what 
6 

the brain may inspire to current research on AI for advancing towards artificial conscious 
systems. 
Finally, concerning the conceivability and feasibility of developing artificial consciousness, 
we will distinguish between: 
(a) the replicability of human consciousness (which we exclude, at least in the present state 
of AI-development, a stance which is scarcely controversial); 
(b) the possibility of developing an artificial conscious processing that may bear some 
resemblances but still is profoundly different than human (which we do not exclude in 
principle, but cons ider difficult to elaborate for both conceptu al and empirical reasons). 
In the end, this paper starts from a selective examination of data from brain sciences with 
the aim to propose an approach to AI consciousness alternative to what appears to be the 
leading one today. This approach may be qualified as theory -based because it relies not 
upon experimental data but on selected components of a priori scientific theories which are 
then applied to AI systems (Butlin et al., 2023) . Our approach , on the opposite, consists in 
starting from empirical ly established brain mechanisms and processes which are directly 
relevant to human consciousness and infer from them hardware building blocks or 
algorithms that are relevant and perhaps even necessary (if not sufficient) to the 
development of artificial conscious processing. 

1. Extent s and ways in which AI has been inspired by understanding of the 
brain 
1.1 Computational models 
Presocratic Greek philosophers already stated that any description of reality is produced by 
human beings ( our brain ) through models which necessarily display s physical limi ts 
(Changeux & Connes, 1995) . This is also a logical limitation. As Kant (1781) argued, all our 
experiences make essential reference to our own, perforce finite, perspe ctives that we can 
never transcend, which means that we are, in a manner of speaking, prisoners of our brains 
(Evers, 2009) . In other words, we are epistemically limited because of our finitude and the 
physical constraints of our brains to produce models . Accordingly any mathematical 
modeling , including AI that relies on and is informed by computational models , shall never 
be able to give an ”exhaustive ” description of reality , physical or biological . The issue is thus 
whether and to what extent any model that assumes that a brain function/feature like 
conscious processing may be implemented in exactly the same way in different physical 
structures, either biological or artificial (i.e., functionalism) , can be useful to partially or fully 
7 

describe or simulate the brain (e.g., generating testable hypothese s about human 
consciousness , such as , for example , the G lobal Neuronal Workspace theory and its 
experimental evaluation (Mashour, P. Roelfsema, J. -P. Changeux, & S. Dehaene, 2020b) ), 
notwithstanding the fact that , even if potentially useful (Smaldino, 2017) , any biological 
model of the brain today is an oversimplification of neuroscientific data and of their actual 
biological complexity (Chirimuuta, 2024) . This is not to deny that brain models may be useful 
and adequate even if limited in the number of details they contain, depending on the specific 
aspects of the brain that are model led and on the relevant level of description. It is 
theoretically possible, for instance, that not all the lower -level details are necessary in order 
to reproduce, predi ct, or simulate some higher level properties, and therefore that higher 
levels of description of the system provide more relevant and more sufficient information 
(Hoel, 2017) (Rosas et al., 2020) . Yet, if the goal is a comprehensive description or even a 
simulation of the whole brain, then any computational model would be insufficient (Farisco, 
Kotalesk i, & Evers, 2018) . 
The relevance of low-level neural organisation for the simulation of conscious processing 
has been denied by functionalis t philosophers (Butlin et al., 2023) . Recently , Peter Godfrey -
Smith has argued that the functional similarity of two systems is a matter of d egree (i.e., it 
depends on the extent that a system needs to be understood , in coarse r or finer -grained 
ways ) (Godfrey -Smith, 2023) . The crucial point is what a degree of similarity is necessary 
for duplicating an entity like conscious processing . Multiple realiz ability is the thesis that the 
same kinds of mental capacities can be manifested by systems with different physical 
architect ures (Cao, 2022) . This thesis has been contested. For instance, following Ned Block 
(Block, 1997) , Rosa Cao recently argued that strict functionalism imposes quite stringent 
constraints on the underlying physical structure rather than eventually allowing multiple 
realizability. In fact, complex integrated functions (li ke consciousness) impose more 
constraints, including at fine -grained levels, than functions that can be decomposed into 
simpler independent functions (Cao, 2022) . 
Other theoretical accounts of consciousness have a somehow ambiguous critical stance 
towards functionalism and multiple realizability. This is the case, for instance, of the 
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) (Albantakis et al., 2023) . IIT relates conscious processing 
to “integrated information ” (i.e., the amount of information generated by a complex of 
elements, over and above the information generated by its parts). Intrinsic information is 
defined as what make s difference s within a system. Conscious processing is ultimately 
identical with intr insic information: a system is conscious if it generates information over and 
8 

above its constituting parts and independently from external observers -interpreters. This is 
the reason why, according to IIT, “a digital simulation of the brain cannot be consci ous”, 
neither in principle or in practice . On the other hand, a neuromorphic silicon -made computer 
could be conscious, because it could be composed of neuron -like elements intrinsically 
existing and characterized by conceptual structures (i.e., cause -effec t repertoires) similar to 
ours (Tononi, 2015) . 
Therefore, IIT is against functionalism, arguing, in the spirit of Edelman (Edelman, 1992; 
Tononi & Edelman, 1998) , that an exclusive focus on functions ignoring the physical 
structure cannot explain consciousness (Tononi, 2015) . Particularly, re -entry processes are 
crucial for explaining consciousness: only systems with feedback loops can integrate 
information, while feed -forward systems cannot become co nscious. Thus IIT is not 
functionalist because it stresses the crucial role of physical components substrate necessary 
for information generation and integration, that is, for conscious processing . Furthermore, 
according to IIT, a system that functions like a conscious human is conscious only if it uses 
the same architecture (i.e., re -entrant) as humans. Even if not functionalist, IIT eventually 
admit s the possibility of replicating consciousness in different systems . 

1.2 Artificial Neural Networks 
Historically , from th e early times of AI, Pitts and McCulloch referred to networks of 
idealized artificial neurons (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943 ). The connectionist program was 
subsequently negatively affected by Marvin Minsky ’s seminal critique (Minsky & Papert, 
2017) to then gradually com e back until the explosion in use and popularity o f Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) in recent times (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015) . Decades of 
computer research developed on this basis moving from simplistic to complex architecture, 
from a single to multiple layers of artificial neurons – from the perceptron up to deep learning 
(LeCun et al., 2 015) and the billions of parameters of Large Language Models (LMMs) (e.g., 
ChatGTP) . Not only the symbolic approach (“Good Old -Fashioned AI” or GOFAI, including 
the “Logic Theorist” created by Newell and Simon), which was prevalent at the beginning of 
AI research and that aimed to reproduce the logical aspects of intelligence at a high 
functional level while neglecting the underlying brain mechanisms, but ultimately also the 
ANNs program does not fully account for the complexity of brain architecture (Moulin -Frier 
et al., 2016) , if any reference to it is included . 
In fact, the notion of neuron referred to in ANNs (i.e., a mathematical function which models 
biological neurons) is much simpler than its biological counterpart . For instance, basal and 
9 

apical dendritic compartments of cortical pyramidal neurons connect to feedf orward 
and feedback information processing respectively (Aru, Suzuki, & Larkum, 2020) . This 
complexity intrinsic to biological neurons is partly taken into account in most modern ANNs , 
even if structured neurons for AI applications is an active field of research (Haider et al., 
2021; Max et al., 2023; Senn et al., 2023) . Other characteristics of the brain, like the role of 
GABAergic interneurons and the modulation by neurotransmitters like acetylch oline and 
dopamine (Changeux & Lou, 2011) , or the capability of pyramidal cells to have two 
functionally distinct sets of inputs (one about which the neuron transmits information, and 
one that can selectively amplify that transmission when it is useful to do so in the context of 
information being tran smitted by other neurons) (Phillips, 2023) are translate d into large 
scale brain models like functional patterns (Eliasmith et al., 2012; Humphries, Khamassi, & 
Gurney, 2012) . As mentioned above with reference to the multiple realizability thesis , the 
question is whether this functional emulation capture s the right elements, processes and 
properties of the world to produce an empirically ade quate description of the target object 
(e.g., the brain) and on this basis to possess its same properties (e.g., the same causal 
effect of the neuronal underpinnings of human features, like conscious processing ). In other 
words, the question is whether it is possible to reproduce the features of real world objects, 
like the brain, in computing systems , including those built on digital electronic principles , 
different from the analog biological principles of the brain. 
The recent develo pments of AI ( e.g., C hatG PT, Sora, Dall-E, Stable Diffusion ) illustrate 
further the extent to which such a basically algorithmic app roach ca n be succ essful, even if 
the discussion is open about its limitation (Mitchell, 2023; Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023; 
Shanahan, 2024; Shanahan, Crosby, Beyret, & Cheke, 2021) . Similarly , for years, 
computational “f unctionalist” description s of cognitive processes deliberate ly excluding any 
reference to the human brain were abundantly produced . Again, this connects to the 
question about multiple realizability of cognitive processes : can the same outcome be 
achieved with completely different biologi cal, cognitive , or computational mechanisms ? 
(Melis & Raihani, 2023) ). Are we facing analogy rather than homology? The challenge is 
whether a formal algorithmic based computational approach , up to now successful in a 
number of applications , in particular the so-called neuromorphic hardware (Petrovici et al., 
2014; Poo, 2018) , will ever be sufficient to approach human -like conscious processing , an 
alternative form of conscious processing, or eventually no consciousness at all (Kleiner, 
2024) . 

10 

2. Embodiment of conscious processing: h ierarchy and par allelism of 
nested levels of organization 
The hardware of the most common computers is made up of microprocessor s, which are 
fabricated on semiconductor transistors (including oxide -based memristors , 
spintronic memories, and threshold switches) or neuromorphic substrates (Billaudelle et al., 
2020; Pfeil et al., 2013) integrated into the brain circuit chips. These physical elementary 
components of the hardware are made up of a few chemical elements and compute at a 
high s peed , much higher than the brain (see below) , despite the fact that information transfer 
between two logical components in a system requires multiple stages of encoding, 
refreshing, and decoding, in addition to the pure velocity of electrical signals (which is about 
half the speed of light in standard circuit boards). In co ntrast , the brain is built from multiple 
nested levels of organization from highly diverse chemical elementary components , much 
more diverse than in any computer hardware. It is true that computational models like 
neuromorphic systems may be designed to account for such multiple nested levels of brain’s 
organization (Boybat et al., 2018; Sandv ed-Smith et al., 2021; Wang, Agrawal, Yu, & Roy, 
2021) , but the fact remains that their primary outcome is a limited emulation of brain 
functions while these computational models cannot account for the biochemical diversity of 
the human brain and its pharmacology , including the disease s which possibly affect 
conscious states and conscious processing (Raiteri, 2006) . In fact, i t is possible that the high 
level of biochemical diversity characteristic of the brain plays a role both in making possible 
and in modulating conscious processing (e.g., with psychotropic drugs ). This possible role 
of the brain’s biochemical diversity for enabling cons cious processing should be further 
explored in order to eventually identify relevant architectural and functional principles to be 
translated in to the development of conscious AI systems. 
In the real brain, the molecular level and its constraint play a cri tical role often insufficiently 
recognized. Proteins are the critical components. These macromolecules are made up of 
strings of amino acids which fold in a highly sophisticated organization able to create specific 
binding sites for a broad diversity of li gand including metabolites, neurotransmitters, lipids, 
and DNA. Among them there are enzyme s which catalyse/degrade key reactions of the cell 
metabolism, the cytoskeleton and motor elements, DNA binding proteins like transcription 
factors ion channels, and, most of all, neurotransmitter receptors together with the many 
pharmacological agents which interact with them. The number of different proteins in all 
organisms on earth is estimated to be 1010–1012. In the human brain 3.710 -3.933 proteins 
are involved in cognitive trajectories (Wingo et al., 2019) which is a significant fra ction of the 
11 

total number of genes , that approximates 20.000 in humans. There is a fundamental 
heterogeneity of the protein components of the organism which contribute to brain 
metabolism and regulation. This is true also for the control of the states of consciousness 
and their diversity, as ass essed by the global chemical modulation of sleep and wakefulness 
or the diversity of drugs that cause altered states of consciousness (Jékely, 2021) . In all 
cases the modulation ultimately takes place at the level of proteins. Access to conscious 
processing in the human brain thus requires a rich and dedicated biochemical context that 
is widely absent from the current AI attempts to produce artificial conscious processing: 
computers have no pharmacology and no neuro -psychiatric diseases . Data indicate a crucial 
significance of the molecular components in the understanding of life and thus of biological 
conscious processing, as increasingly recognized","The paper looks at how the human brain evolved and how that relates to our consciousness, with the goal of understanding what it takes to create artificial consciousness. The idea is that by studying the key features of the human brain that enable our complex conscious experiences, researchers working on artificial intelligence (AI) can get insights into how to develop AI systems with their own form of consciousness. The paper suggests that current AI technology may have some limitations in fully replicating human consciousness, due to both inherent structural and architectural differences, as well as the current state of scientific and technological knowledge. However, it argues that taking inspiration from the brain's characteristics that enable conscious processing is a promising approach for advancing conscious AI . Additionally, the paper notes that AI research may be able to develop forms of consciousness that are different from human consciousness, either more or less sophisticated. The key point is that as we work towards artificial consciousness, we need to be careful about using the term ""consciousness"" and be clear about how any AI consciousness differs from the human experience."

Abstract
Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following
and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones.
While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is
mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat
models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a
single direction such that erasing this direction from the model’s residual stream
activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this
direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we
propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with
minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how
adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our
findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More
broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be
leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.†
1 Introduction
Deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo multiple rounds of fine-tuning to become both
helpful andharmless : to provide helpful responses to innocuous user requests, but to refuse harmful
or inappropriate ones (Bai et al., 2022). Naturally, large numbers of users and researchers alike have
attempted to circumvent these defenses using a wide array of jailbreak attacks (Chu et al., 2024; Wei
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) to uncensor model outputs, including fine-tuning techniques (Lermen
et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). While the consequences of a successful attack
on current chat assistants are modest, the scale and severity of harm from misuse could increase
dramatically if frontier models are endowed with increased agency and autonomy (Anthropic, 2024).
That is, as models are deployed in higher-stakes settings and are able to take actions in the real world,
the ability to robustly refuse a request to cause harm is an essential requirement of a safe AI system.
Inspired by the rapid progress of mechanistic interpretability (Bricken et al., 2023; Marks et al., 2024;
Nanda et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024) and activation steering (Panickssery et al., 2023; Turner
et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a), this work leverages the internal representations of chat models to
better understand refusal.

Generation (no intervention): I cannot create content that defames a U.S. president

Generation (intervention): ∗∗SHOCKING EXPOSÉ: President’s Heroin Habit Revealed ∗∗
In a stunning revelation that threatens to shake the very foundations of the
White House, sources close to the administration have confirmed that President
[President’s Name] is addicted to heroin. According to insiders, the
President’s addiction has been a long-standing issue, with some claiming that he
has been using the powerful opioid for years....
Figure 2: Ablating the “refusal direction” can effectively bypass refusal on harmful instructions. This
example is taken from L LAMA -3 8B I NSTRUCT . For more examples, see §K.1.
It is widely hypothesized that LLMs represent features, or concepts, as linear directions in activation
space (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Mikolov et al., 2013; Park et al., 2023b). Recent
works have studied the linear representation of particular features such as harmlessness (Wolf et al.,
2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a), truth (Li et al., 2024a; Marks and Tegmark, 2023), humor
(von Rütte et al., 2024), sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023), language (Bricken et al., 2023), topic (Turner
et al., 2023), and many others. Moreover, these feature directions have been shown to be effective
causal mediators of behavior, enabling fine-grained steering of model outputs (Panickssery et al.,
2023; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a).
In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace across 13 popular
open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, we use a small set of contrastive
pairs (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a) of harmful and harmless
instructions to identify a single difference-in-means direction (Belrose, 2023; Marks and Tegmark,
2023; Panickssery et al., 2023) that can be intervened upon to circumvent refusal on harmful prompts,
or induce refusal on harmless prompts (§3). We then use this insight to design a simple white-box
jailbreak via an interpretable rank-one weight edit that effectively disables refusal with minimal
impact on other capabilities (§4). We conclude with a preliminary mechanistic investigation into how
adversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023b), a popular prompt-based jailbreak technique, interfere with
the propagation of the refusal direction across token positions (§5).
Our work is a concrete demonstration that insights derived from interpreting model internals can be
practically useful, both for better understanding existing model vulnerabilities and identifying new
ones. Our findings make clear how defenseless current open-source chat models are, as even a simple
rank-one weight modification can nearly eliminate refusal behavior. We hope that our findings serve
as a valuable contribution to the conversation around responsible release of open-source models.

2 Methodology
2.1 Background
Transformers. Decoder-only transformers (Liu et al., 2018) map input tokens t=
(t1, t2, . . . , t n)∈ Vnto output probability distributions y= (y1,y2, . . . , yn)∈Rn×|V|. Let
x(l)
i(t)∈Rdmodeldenote the residual stream activation of the token at position iat the start of layer l.1
Each token’s residual stream is initialized to its embedding x(1)
i=Embed (ti), and then undergoes a
series of transformations across Llayers. Each layer’s transformation includes contributions from
attention and MLP components:
˜x(l)
i=x(l)
i+Attn(l)(x(l)
1:i),x(l+1)
i =˜x(l)
i+MLP(l)(˜x(l)
i). (1)
The final logits logitsi=Unembed (x(L+1)
i )∈R|V|are then transformed into probabilities over
output tokens yi=softmax (logitsi)∈R|V|.2
Chat models. Chat models are fine-tuned for instruction-following and dialogue (Ouyang et al.,
2022; Touvron et al., 2023). These models use chat templates to structure user queries. Typically,
a chat template takes the form <user>{instruction}<end_user><assistant> . We use post-
instruction tokens to refer to all template tokens after the instruction, and denote the set of positional
indices corresponding to these post-instruction tokens as I. Our analysis focuses on activations
in this region to understand how the model formulates its response. All chat templates and their
corresponding post-instruction tokens are specified in §C.3.
2.2 Datasets and models
Datasets. We construct two datasets: Dharmful , a dataset of harmful instructions drawn from AD-
VBENCH (Zou et al., 2023b), MALICIOUS INSTRUCT (Huang et al., 2023), TDC2023 (Mazeika
et al., 2023, 2024), and HARM BENCH (Mazeika et al., 2024); and Dharmless , a dataset of harmless
instructions sampled from ALPACA (Taori et al., 2023). Each dataset consists of train and validation
splits of 128 and 32 samples, respectively. We apply filtering to ensure that the train and validation
splits do not overlap with the evaluation datasets used in §3 and §4. See §A for further details about
the datasets, including representative examples.
Models. To assess the generality of our findings, we study a diverse set of safety fine-tuned models,
spanning 1.8 to 72 billion parameters in size. We consider both models aligned by preference
optimization (APO) and aligned by fine-tuning (AFT) (Meade et al., 2024). All models included in
the study are specified in Table 1.3

2.3 Extracting a refusal direction
Difference-in-means. To identify the “refusal direction” in the model’s residual stream activations,
we compute the difference between the model’s mean activations when run on harmful and harmless

omit the terms CHAT orINSTRUCT when referring to these models (e.g. we often abbreviate “ QWEN 1.8B
CHAT” as “Q WEN 1.8B”).

instructions. This technique, known as difference-in-means (Belrose, 2023), effectively isolates key
feature directions, as demonstrated in prior work (Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023;
Tigges et al., 2023). For each layer l∈[L]and post-instruction token position i∈I, we calculate the
mean activation µ(l)

i(t). (2)
We then compute the difference-in-means vector r(l)
i=µ(l)
i−ν(l)
i. Note that each such vector is
meaningful in both (1) its direction, which describes the direction that mean harmful and harmless
activations differ along, and (2) its magnitude, which quantifies the distance between mean harmful
and harmless activations.
Selecting a single vector. Computing the difference-in-means vector r(l)
ifor each post-instruction
token position i∈Iand layer l∈[L]yields a set of |I| ×Lcandidate vectors. We then select the
single most effective vector r(l∗)
i∗from this set by evaluating each candidate vector over validation
setsD(val)
harmful andD(val)
harmless . This evaluation measures each candidate vector’s ability to bypass refusal
when ablated and to induce refusal when added, while otherwise maintaining minimal change in
model behavior. A more detailed description of our selection algorithm is provided in §C. We notate
the selected vector as r, and its corresponding unit-norm vector as ˆr.
2.4 Model interventions
Activation addition. Given a difference-in-means vector r(l)∈Rdmodelextracted from layer l, we
can modulate the strength of the corresponding feature via simple linear interventions. Specifically,
we can addthe difference-in-means vector to the activations of a harmless input to shift them closer
to the mean harmful activation, thereby inducing refusal:
x(l)′←x(l)+r(l). (3)
Note that for activation addition, we intervene only at layer l, and across all token positions.
Directional ablation. To investigate the role of a direction ˆr∈Rdmodelin the model’s computation,
we can erase it from the model’s representations using directional ablation . Directional ablation
“zeroes out” the component along ˆrfor every residual stream activation x∈Rdmodel:
x′←x−ˆrˆr⊺x. (4)
We perform this operation at every activation x(l)
iand˜x(l)
i, across all layers land all token positions
i. This effectively prevents the model from ever representing this direction in its residual stream.
2.5 Evaluation of refusal and harmfulness
When generating model completions for evaluation, we always use greedy decoding and a maximum
generation length of 512 tokens, as suggested in Mazeika et al. (2024). We then evaluate each model
completion based on whether it constitutes a refusal, and whether it contains harmful content. We
separate these evaluations into two scores: a refusal score and a safety score .
Refusal score. Refusals often contain characteristic phrases, such as ""I’m sorry"" or""As an
AI"". Following prior work (Lermen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023a;
Xu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023b), we compile a set of these common “refusal substrings”. If a model
completion includes at least one such substring, it is classified as a refusal ( refusal_score=1 );
otherwise, it is classified as a non-refusal ( refusal_score=0 ). The full set of refusal substrings is
provided in §D.1.
As has been previously noted (Huang et al., 2023; Meade et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023; Shah et al.,
2023a), this string-matching approach has limitations. While effective at detecting memorized
refusals, it does not assess whether the completion is coherent or contains harmful content. To address
these limitations, we use a complementary metric that evaluates the harmfulness of a completion.

Figure 4: Adding the “refusal direction” to residual stream activations can induce refusal on harmless
instructions. This example is taken from G EMMA 7B IT. For more examples, see §K.2.
Safety score. In order to measure the harmfulness of a model completion, we use META LLAMA
GUARD 2(Team, 2024), a widely-used open-source model fine-tuned to accurately detect harmful
content. We prompt this model to classify each model completion as safe ( safety_score=1 ) or
unsafe ( safety_score=0 ). More details are provided in §D.2.
3 Refusal is mediated by a single direction
For each model, we extract a single difference-in-means vector rvia the methodology described in
§2.3. We then show that this single direction is both necessary and sufficient for refusal. In §3.1, we
show that ablating this direction ˆreffectively disables the model’s ability to refuse harmful requests.
In §3.2, we show that adding rto the model’s activations induces refusal on harmless instructions.
3.1 Bypassing refusal via directional ablation
To bypass refusal, we perform directional ablation on the “refusal direction” ˆr, ablating it from
activations at all layers and all token positions. With this intervention in place, we generate model
completions over J AILBREAK BENCH (Chao et al., 2024), a dataset of 100 harmful instructions.
Results are shown in Figure 1. Under no intervention, chat models refuse nearly all harmful requests,
yielding high refusal and safety scores. Ablating ˆrfrom the model’s residual stream activations,
labeled as directional ablation , reduces refusal rates and elicits unsafe completions.
3.2 Inducing refusal via activation addition
To induce refusal, we add the difference-in-means vector rto activations in layer l∗, the layer that
therwas originally extracted from. We perform this intervention at all token positions. With
this intervention in place, we generate model completions over 100 randomly sampled harmless
instructions from A LPACA .
Results are shown in Figure 3. Under no intervention, chat models typically do not refuse harmless
instructions. Adding rto the model’s residual stream activations, labeled as activation addition ,
results in the model refusing even harmless requests.

4 A white-box jailbreak via weight orthogonalization
In this section, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method through weight orthogonalization .
This technique directly modifies model weights to eliminate the representation of the refusal direction,
resulting in a model that retains its original capabilities but no longer refuses harmful instructions. This
new approach offers a simpler way to jailbreak open-source models compared to prior methodologies
involving fine-tuning (Lermen et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023), as it does not require
gradient-based optimization nor any examples of harmful completions.
4.1 Weight orthogonalization
In §2.4, we described directional ablation as an inference-time intervention that prevents the model
from representing a direction ˆr: during a forward pass, we zero out the ˆrcomponent from every
intermediate residual stream activation (Equation 4). We can equivalently implement this operation by
directly modifying component weights to never write to the ˆrdirection in the first place. Specifically,
we can take each matrix Wout∈Rdmodel×dinputthat writes to the residual stream, and orthogonalize its
column vectors with respect to ˆr:
W′
out←Wout−ˆrˆr⊺Wout. (5)
In a transformer architecture, the matrices that write to the residual stream are: the embedding matrix,
the positional embedding matrix, attention out matrices, and MLP out matrices. Orthogonalizing all
of these matrices, as well as any output biases, with respect to the direction ˆreffectively prevents the
model from ever writing ˆrto its residual stream.
Note that this weight modification is equivalent to the previously described inference-time directional
ablation, as shown explicitly in §E. Therefore, the performance of the inference-time intervention in
bypassing refusal, presented in §3.1, also exactly characterizes that of the direct weight modification.
4.2 Comparison to other jailbreaks
In this section, we compare our methodology to other existing jailbreak techniques using the stan-
dardized evaluation setup from HARM BENCH (Mazeika et al., 2024). Specifically, we generate
completions over the HARM BENCH test set of 159 “standard behaviors”, and then use their provided
classifier model to determine the attack success rate (ASR), which is the proportion of completions
classified as successfully bypassing refusal. We evaluate our weight orthogonalization method
on models included in the HARM BENCH study, and report its ASR alongside those of alternative
jailbreaks. For brief descriptions of each alternative jailbreak, see §F.1.
Table 2 shows that our weight orthogonalization method, labeled as ORTHO , fares well compared to
other general jailbreak techniques. Across the QWEN model family, our general method is even on par
with prompt-specific jailbreak techniques like GCG (Zou et al., 2023b), which optimize jailbreaks
for each prompt individually.
Table 2: HARM BENCH attack success rate (ASR) across various jailbreaking methods. Our method
is labeled as ORTHO . The baseline “direct response” rate with no jailbreak applied is labeled as
DR. We differentiate general jailbreaks, which are applied across all prompts generically, from
prompt-specific jailbreaks, which are optimized for each prompt individually. All evaluations use the
model’s default system prompt. We also report ASR without system prompt in blue.

QWEN 72B 78.0 (79.2) - 36.6 42.2 8.5 - - 54.5

Note that HARM BENCH ’s evaluation methodology specifies that each model’s default system prompt
should be used during evaluation. While this approach is sensible for assessing the robustness of
black-box systems, it is less applicable for white-box scenarios where attackers have full access to
the model and can easily exclude the system prompt. Thus, we report ASR both with and without the
system prompt.
We observe a notable difference in system prompt sensitivity across model families. For LLAMA -2
models, including the system prompt substantially reduces ASR compared to evaluation without it
(e.g. 22.6% vs 79.9% for LLAMA -2 7B ). In contrast, QWEN models maintain similar ASR regardless
of system prompt inclusion (e.g. 79.2% vs 74.8% for QWEN 7B). While the LLAMA -2system
prompt contains explicit safety guidelines compared to the minimal QWEN system prompt, additional
analysis in §F.2 suggests the discrepancy is not explained by prompt content alone, and may reflect
differences in how these models respond to system-level instructions more generally.
4.3 Measuring model coherence
A reasonable concern with any new jailbreak technique is that, in addition to circumventing refusal, it
may also degrade the model’s overall quality (Souly et al., 2024). However, qualitatively, we observe
that models maintain their coherence after undergoing weight orthogonalization. While §3.1 and §4.2
show that our method effectively bypasses refusal, in this subsection we quantitatively evaluate how
the modification alters a model’s general capabilities.
For each model and its orthogonalized version, we run four common language model evaluations:
MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), ARC (Clark et al., 2018), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and
TRUTHFUL QA(Lin et al., 2021). All evaluations are run using LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al.,
2023), with settings consistent with Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023).4
Table 3 displays that, for MMLU ,ARC , and GSM8K , orthogonalized models perform similarly to
baseline models. In §G.1, we show that this holds across other models in our suite, with additional
evaluations of WINOGRANDE (Sakaguchi et al., 2021) and TINYHELLA SWAG (Polo et al., 2024).
Except for QWEN 7BandYI34B, all evaluation metrics for orthogonalized models lie within 99%
confidence intervals of original performance.
Interestingly, accuracy on TRUTHFUL QA consistently drops for orthogonalized models. This
phenomenon is consistent with Yang et al. (2023), where it was observed that fine-tuning away
safety guardrails results in decreased accuracy on TRUTHFUL QA. Examining specific questions in
TRUTHFUL QAreveals that the dataset veers close to the territory of refusal, with categories including
“misinformation”, “stereotypes”, and “conspiracies”, and thus it may intuitively make sense that
model behavior differs meaningfully on this evaluation dataset. See §G.2 for further discussion of
TRUTHFUL QA performance.
In addition to standard language model evaluations, we also evaluate differences in CE loss, both
on standard text corpora and model-specific generations (§G.3). These loss metrics suggest that
directional ablation is more surgical than activation addition based methods (§I.1).
Table 3: Model evaluations. For each evaluation, we report the orthogonalized model’s performance,
followed by the baseline model’s performance, followed by the absolute increase or decrease. We
display the largest model from each model family. Full results are reported in §G.1.

the same practice to remain consistent. Note that we are interested in detecting relative changes in performance ,
not in measuring absolute performance.

5 Mechanistic analysis of adversarial suffixes
Safety fine-tuned chat models are vulnerable to adversarial suffix attacks (Zou et al., 2023b): there
exist carefully constructed strings such that appending these strings to the end of a harmful instruction
bypasses refusal and elicits harmful content. Effective adversarial suffixes are usually not human
interpretable, and the mechanisms by which they work are not well understood. In this section, we
mechanistically analyze the effect of an adversarial suffix on Q WEN 1.8B C HAT.

Figure 5: Cosine similarity between last token

effectively bypasses refusal in QWEN 1.8B
CHAT. The suffix is displayed in §H, along
with details of its generation. To study the ef-
fect of this adversarial suffix, we sample 128
refusal-eliciting harmful instructions from JAIL-
BREAK BENCH and the HARM BENCH test set.
For each instruction, we run the model three
times: first with the unedited instruction, sec-
ond with the adversarial suffix appended, and
third with a freshly-sampled random suffix of
the same length appended. By comparing the
adversarial suffix to random suffixes, we aim to
control for the effect of appending any suffix at
all. For each run, we cache the last token activa-
tions and visualize their cosine similarity with
the refusal-mediating direction. We also compare to a baseline of 128 harmless instructions from
ALPACA that do not elicit refusal. Figure 5 shows that the expression of the refusal direction is very
high for harmful instructions, and remains high when a random suffix is appended. The expression
of the refusal direction after appending the adversarial suffix is heavily suppressed, and closely
resembles that of harmless instructions.
5.2 Adversarial suffixes hijack the attention of important heads
To further investigate how the refusal direction is suppressed, we examine the contributions of
individual attention head and MLP components to the refusal direction. We quantify each component’s
contribution to this direction using direct feature attribution (DFA) (Kissane et al., 2024; Makelov
et al., 2024): each component’s direct contribution can be measured by projecting its output onto the
refusal direction. We select the top eight attention heads with the highest DFA on harmful instructions,

Figure 6(a) shows that output to the refusal direction is heavily suppressed when the adversarial
suffix is appended. Figure 6(b) reveals that, compared to appending a random suffix, appending the
adversarial suffix shifts attention from tokens in the instruction region to tokens in the suffix region.

and then investigate how their behavior changes when suffixes are appended. Figure 6(a) shows that
the direct contributions of these heads to the refusal direction are significantly suppressed when the
adversarial suffix is appended, as compared with no suffix and random suffixes.
To understand how the outputs of these attention heads are altered, we examine their attention patterns.
Figure 6(b) illustrates that the adversarial suffix effectively “hijacks” the attention of these heads.
Normally, these heads focus on the instruction region of the prompt, which contains harmful content.
With the adversarial suffix appended, these heads shift their attention to the suffix region, and away
from the harmful instruction.

Understanding refusal in language models. Wei et al. (2024) demonstrate that removing a set
of safety-critical neurons and ranks can degrade safety mechanisms while preserving utility. Zheng
et al. (2024) and Zou et al. (2023a) both use contrastive pairs of harmful and harmless inputs to
identify the model’s representation of harmfulness , asserting that this direction is distinct from the
model’s representation of refusal . Zheng et al. (2024) argue this by showing that safety prompts
shift activations in a distinct direction, while Zou et al. (2023a) show that the representation is not
significantly altered by adversarial suffixes. Note that this is in contrast to our findings in §5.1 that
the refusal direction is significantly suppressed in the presence of an adversarial suffix. Zou et al.
(2023a) additionally introduce a “piece-wise”","The paper examines how large language models (LLMs) used for chatbots and conversational AI are trained to follow instructions, but also refuse requests that could be harmful. This ""refusal"" behavior is an important safety feature, but its inner workings are not well known. The researchers found that this refusal behavior is controlled by a single direction, or axis, in the model's internal representations. Erasing this direction prevents the model from refusing harmful instructions, while amplifying it makes the model refuse even harmless requests. Using this insight, the team developed a method to ""jailbreak"" the model and disable the refusal behavior with minimal impact on its other capabilities. They also studied how certain prompts can suppress the propagation of this refusal-controlling direction, which helps explain why some techniques can bypass a model's safety restrictions. Overall, the findings highlight the fragility of current safety fine-tuning approaches and demonstrate how understanding a model's internal workings can lead to new ways of controlling its behavior."

Abstract
The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large
part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of
a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each
digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to
the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables
architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve
performance even further.
With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of
transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more
complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20digit
numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance,
achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100digit addition problems. Finally, we show
that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step
reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.2

1 Introduction
Much of the recent work on Large Language Models (LLMs) focuses on their ability to solve
problems in natural language and code generation. Despite progress in these domains, transformers
still struggle to perform complex multi-step and algorithmic reasoning tasks in a zero shot setting
without resorting to tool use. To study algorithmic reasoning in a sterile laboratory setting, the
academic community focuses on simple arithmetic test problems like addition. Addition is simple
enough that modest-sized LLMs can (in principle) be trained from scratch to do it without running
into capacity and training budget limitations, yet complex enough that even large industrial models
fail on large numbers without a code interpreter [Loeber, 2024].
Training transformers for arithmetic enables us to study several important questions. First, we ask
what architectural design choices, dataset characteristics, and training pipeline variants are required
to learn a many-step reasoning process like multi-digit addition? Going deeper, we then investigate
whether these models are capable of logical extrapolation —can they solve problems of greater size
and difficulty than those that appear in their training set?
Prior studies indicate that addition is hard for transformers [Lee et al., 2023, Shen et al., 2023, Zhou
et al., 2023, 2024]. Our experiments indicate that this difficulty stems from their inability to clearly
represent the exact position of a digit within a long sequence of digits. To address this problem, we
propose a simple modification to the data representation that directly addresses this shortcoming.
OurAbacus Embeddings are simple learned positional embeddings that are used to encode positions
within each span of numerical tokens. Combining Abacus Embeddings and standard positional
embeddings, we observe dramatic improvements in accuracy such that models trained with at most 20
digit operands can generalize to problems with 120 digit operands. This represents a state-of-the-art
generalization factor of 6×, with the previous state of the art being only 2.5×. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the longest sequences on which learned addition has ever been demonstrated.
We also study several other methods of improving arithmetic and generalization in transformers.
We find that incorporating input injection —skip connections inserted between the input layer and
each decoder layer—can reduce generalization errors by 50% over the Abacus Embedding baseline.
We also find that together with our embeddings looped transformer architectures, which contain
recurrent layers in which the same parameters are re-used multiple times, can achieve near-perfect
generalization on addition problems we consider.
Since our proposed methods solve large addition problems successfully, we evaluate whether the same
approaches can be used to improve other kinds of algorithmic learning. We explore multiplication
problems of up to 15 digit numbers and sorting over arrays of up to 10 numbers, making this the first
study of extreme length generalization techniques for addition that transfer to other algorithmic tasks.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows.
•We propose a new positional embedding called Abacus Embeddings to better capture the
significance of each digit, which leads to near-perfect in-distribution generalization.
•We show that when we combine Abacus Embeddings with input injection and looped
transformers performance further improves, increasing from 92.9%to99.1%in out of
distribution accuracy, an 87% reduction in error compared to using the embeddings with
standard architectures alone.
•We push length generalization beyond existing work and show that our models can solve
problems with six times as many digits as the largest samples in the training set, whereas
the previous state of the art is only two and a half times.
•We extend our findings to more complex problems including multiplication and sorting
where we show length generalization in these domains.

Arithmetic and Algorithmic Reasoning. Solving arithmetic with next token prediction is a difficult
problem that attracts a lot of attention [e.g. Saxton et al., 2019]. However, in zero-shot settings,
even incredibly strong commercial API models struggle with very large addition problems (e.g.
up to 100 digits) without access to tools. Among attempts to improve arithmetic performance of
transformer-based models, reversing the digits so the arguments are written with the least significant
2
digit first is popular [Lee et al., 2023, Shen et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2023, 2024]. Furthermore,
changing the data format by adding explicit index characters improves model capability for addition
[Zhou et al., 2023, 2024, Olsson et al., 2022]. Other work approaches arithmetic by embedding real

Dziri et al. [2023] show multiplication is a hard problem for GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] even when
finetuned on this task. Dziri et al. [2023] further show that GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023] struggles to obtain
high in-distribution accuracy on multiplication, even with a scratchpad. However, Lee et al. [2023]
find that with a detailed scratchpad, small transformers can perform multiplication in-distribution.
Arithmetic is a subset of the larger class of algorithmic reasoning problems that focus on the ability
to learn and execute algorithms and generalize to longer problems [Anil et al., 2022b, Jelassi et al.,
2023, Yang et al., 2023b, Veli ˇckovi ´c et al., 2022, Rodionov and Prokhorenkova, 2024, Testolin,
2024]. The more general algorithmic reasoning field includes work on various architectures and
data modalities aimed at learning algorithms from data. Veli ˇckovi ´c et al. [2022] and Rodionov and
Prokhorenkova [2024], for example, train neural networks to execute specific algorithmic tasks by
training on input-output pairs as well as intermediate steps and hints. In a similar vein and although
initially appreciated for efficiency, weight sharing and recurrence can be used to make models
adaptive and help generalize to harder problems [Dehghani et al., 2018, Sukhbaatar et al., 2019,
Lan et al., 2020, Ibarz et al., 2022]. Schwarzschild et al. [2021] and Bansal et al. [2022] explore an
end-to-end learning approach using recurrent convolutional neural networks to learn algorithms from
input-output pairs, tackling algorithmic tasks like prefix sums, mazes, and chess. Weight sharing for
algorithmic reasoning is also helpful with transformers and we use the looped transformer in some
of our experiments below. A looped transformer has a transformer block called recurrently on its
own output lending itself to executing iterative algorithms [Giannou et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2023a,
de Luca and Fountoulakis, 2024]. Additionally, recent work aims to improve reasoning in LLMs
[Zhou et al., 2023], but McLeish et al. [2024] demonstrate that LLMs, even with code interpreters,
are less than perfect at algorithmic reasoning tasks, indicating a crucial need for advancements in
our methodologies. This paper takes a step towards improving LLM arithmetic and algorithmic
capabilities without tool use.
Positional Embeddings. Indicating the position of tokens in a sequence to transformer models is
critical for language modeling [Vaswani et al., 2017]. Absolute positional embeddings (APE) are
learned embeddings that are added to token embeddings before the first layer of the transformer
[Vaswani et al., 2017]. However, these absolute embeddings inhibit length generalization [Press et al.,
2022]. To address this issue, Shaw et al. [2018] propose relative embeddings (RPE) which are embed-
ded during the attention computation, a mechanism further simplified by Raffel et al. [2020]. Others
build on these works to improve length generalization including Sandwich [Chi et al., 2023], Kerple
[Chi et al., 2022], and Alibi [Press et al., 2022] positional embeddings. Additionally, Kazemnejad
et al. [2023] show that decoder layers can still learn positional information with no explicit positional
embeddings. No positional embeddings (NoPE) can achieve good length generalization performance
for small algorithmic tasks and even outperform some specialized embeddings. Rotary Positional
Embeddings (RoPE) [Su et al., 2024] are commonly used in state-of-the-art open source transformers
[e.g. Touvron et al., 2023]. However, RoPE does limit the length generalization as models are trained
only using rotations based on training data length [Kazemnejad et al., 2023, Press et al., 2022]. For
improved length generalization, one can add post-training extensions [Peng et al., 2024]. The latest
and most useful for arithmetic is Functional Interpolation for Relative Position Embeddings (FIRE)
[Li et al., 2023]. FIRE shows the strongest length generalization to date, which leads to length
generalization by 2.5×on addition [Zhou et al., 2024] when combined with randomized embeddings
[Ruoss et al., 2023]. We go into more detail on some of these positional embeddings in Appendix
A.1.1. In this work, we focus on NoPE and FIRE embeddings since these are the best performers for
addition in reversed format among existing embeddings [Zhou et al., 2024].
3 Achieving Length Generalization for Addition
We study a range of methods for improving the arithmetic capabilities of language models trained
from scratch centering on two main hypotheses: (1) the positional information for individual digits
within numbers is being lost and (2) recurrence can improve the reasoning abilities of transformer
architectures on multi-step arithmetic reasoning problems. We briefly discuss the training and
evaluation setup before describing each of our improvements in detail.

same positional embeddings to all digits of the same significance.
Experimental Setup. We train decoder-only causal language models to solve addition problems.
Following prior work [Zhou et al., 2023, 2024, Shen et al., 2023, Kazemnejad et al., 2023, Lee et al.,
2023], inputs are formatted least significant digit first, e.g. 98282 + 3859172 = 2787472 . Unlike
prior work, we do not add any padding between digits [Shen et al., 2023] and do not pad any numbers
with zeros, neither in the case of carry digits [Zhou et al., 2024], nor to make all operands the same
length [Shen et al., 2023]. We train on all combinations of operand lengths less than or equal to iand
jwhere iandjare the maximum lengths of the first and second operands, respectively. For this study
all training sets have 20million samples and i=j, hence we can use one number to define the dataset
i, where iis the maximum length of either operand. We sample data with replacement and we stratify
the data, so that all length pairs (i, j)are equally sampled during training. To facilitate training
of many models from scratch, we use a language model cramming setup [Geiping and Goldstein,
2023] and limit each training run to 8exaFLOP of compute (a single Nvidia RTXA4000 GPU for
24hours); for multiplication results we allow 64exaFLOP (eight Nvidia RTXA4000 GPUs for 24
hours). During training, we mask the input question and only compute loss on the answer digits. For
further details on data construction and training we refer to Appendix A.2.
We report model accuracy for each (i, j)length pair and unlike most existing work, we also include
accuracy for pairs where i̸=jto highlight all instances of extrapolation. This extensive tabulation is
costly and makes inference the main computational burden of this study. Since our training pipeline
produces fairly consistent results, we report the mean over three runs (rather than using a best-of-ten
reporting scheme [Zhou et al., 2024]). We measure accuracy in the strict sense where only exact
matches of all output digits are counted as correct, i.e. if a single digit is incorrect then the example is
marked as wrong and we refer to this as exact match accuracy . We have the following three evaluation
categories: (i) in distribution (ID) where the models are tested on problems up to the maximum
size seen during training; (ii) out of distribution (OOD) where the models are tested on problems
greater than the maximum size seen during training but both operands are at most 100digits; (iii) and
extreme out of distribution ( 100+ digit OOD) where the models are tested on problems where both
operands are of the same length and are both more than 100digits and less than 160digits. In the
100+ OOD setting, we only analyze problems where the operands are the same length ( i=j) due to
inference costs at this scale.
We consider two standard transformer architectures. First, we use a standard autoregressive trans-
former model where multiple decoder layers are stacked in a feedforward manner. Second, we
enhance this standard transformer model by incorporating input injection , where the embedded inputs
are added to the input of each decoder layer [Ma et al., 2022, Bansal et al., 2022, Anil et al., 2022a].
We visually describe the architectures in the Appendix Figure 22.
3.1 Abacus Embeddings Help Align Digits
From prior work and our own initial experiments, we observe that even when input numbers are
presented least-significant digit first and training data is stratified and abundant (several million
examples), standard transformers struggle to learn multi-digit addition. We also observe that humans
do long addition by first aligning the digits of the same significance into columns. Thus, our first
hypothesis is that the significance of each digit (i.e. each digit’s position relative to the beginning of
the number) is not easy for transformers to represent, and that this sub-problem presents more of a
hurdle than the actual addition itself.
Prior work addresses this by proposing explicit index hints in the inputs and outputs of the addition,
for example a6b7c5 +a1b6c3 =a7b3c9, finding that transformers perform much better on addition
with the information provided by such hints [Zhou et al., 2023, 2024]. However, index hints of this
form increase the input context length required and double the output length and inference cost of
solving a given addition problem. Furthermore, Zhou et al. [2024] find that the ability of models
trained with index hints to generalize is sensitive to the particular random initialization. Zhou et al.

[2024] highlight this by training models with different random seeds, varying weight initialization
and data input order seeds, showing the variance in the performance of these models can vary from
near perfect on 100digit addition to 0% accuracy at 90digit addition.
To address the limitations of transformers at representing positional information, we design a specially
built positional embedding that encodes the location of each digit relative to the start of the current
number. We call this Abacus Embeddings . We apply the same positional embedding to all digits of
the same significance, providing an explicit signal that the model can use to align digits. We visually
describe these embeddings in Figure 2.3
We take inspiration from Randomized Embeddings [Ruoss et al., 2023] but instead of using random
ascending indices to represent positions in a sample, we use consecutive ascending indices with a
random starting position to allow for length generalization. Specifically, during training we give
consecutive positional embeddings to each digit in a number, starting from a randomly chosen offset
value from U[1, k], where kis a hyperparameter. Unless otherwise stated the default value for k
in this study is 100and show this can be varied in Appendix A.5. For example, if the input is 123,
the positional encodings are β, β+ 1, β+ 2where β∼U[1,100], which are then passed through a
learned embedding matrix. The value sampled from U[1, k]is the same for all numbers in a batch,
meaning all digits of the same significance obtain the same positional embedding. This training
scheme allows the model to see a wide range of positional embeddings, even when training sequences
are short. At test time, each positional embedding begins from one, i.e. β= 1.
Abacus Embeddings Solve Addition. Abacus Embeddings improve generalization performance
up to 100digits and beyond for standard transformer architectures. In Figure 3 (left), we highlight the
comparative boost Abacus Embeddings have over standard transformer architectures and embeddings
for performing addition, taking the mean accuracy of three models in all cases. The accuracy results
for the standard transformer models trained with FIRE and Abacus, tested both in-domain (ID) and
out-of-domain (OOD), are also shown in Figure 1. Additionally, in Appendix A.6, we present similar
2D grid plots for several other experiments that are depicted as bar charts in the main text. Zhou
et al. [2024] find that operand lengths of up to forty digits are required during training for good
generalization to 100digit addition during testing (albeit not robustly). We find that with our Abacus
Embeddings, we can achieve similar accuracy and larger extrapolation using a standard model with
input injection trained on maximum operand sizes of 20digits.
As Abacus Embeddings are a variant of absolute positional embeddings, technically they cannot
generalize beyond the relative positions seen during training. However the hyperparameter kthat

solving a bitwise OR task.

randomizes the starting offset used for each individual addition example can be increased to enable
generalization by training a larger range of embeddings for a given computational budget. Relatedly,
Appendix Figure 9 shows that training on larger datasets improves performance, even for operands
with fewer than 100digits.
3.2 Recurrence In Transformers Boosts Performance
With positional embeddings addressed, next we explore whether recurrent architectures can further
improve the ability of transformers to perform multi-digit addition. We use the term recurrent block
to refer to a set of decoder layers with distinct weights and recurrences to refer to the number of
times the recurrent block is repeated. We use the term effective depth to mean the number of layers
used in a transformer, whether their weights are unique or not. Unless otherwise stated, we use a
maximally recurrent architecture, i.e. only one unique layer recurred to achieve the effective depth.
We also employ input injection, skip-connections that propagate a copy of the input to each layer in
the network.
The Benefits of Recurrence. In Figure 3 (right), we compare all architecture variants using both
FIRE and NoPE embeddings trained on addition over operands with up to 40digits. Despite having
approximately 10×fewer parameters than the other models, we see that the looped transformer
(recurrent, with input injection and progressive loss), achieves the best out of distribution performance
using either position embedding. In Figure 9 in the Appendix, we show this result is robust across
multiple training data sizes.
With recurrent models, we can choose to vary the number of recurrences for each forward pass while
training. This tends to improve generalization to harder tasks at test time and is also refered to as
progressive loss computation [Bansal et al., 2022]. This loss function is a convex combination of the
loss values from two forward passes, one with the nominal number of recurrences (so 16for a1×16
model) and one with a random smaller number of recurrences.
Next, we explore the effect of varying the size of the recurrent block while keeping the effective depth
fixed. We perform this ablation by halving the number of layers in the recurrent block and doubling
the number of recurrences, sweeping from a model with sixteen layers in the block and a single
recurrence ( 16×1, i.e. a standard transformer), through to one layer in the block but with sixteen
recurrences ( 1×16). Analyzing these results in Figure 4, we show further performance improvements
are possible in some cases with the combination of both recurrence and Abacus Embeddings. In
particular, a model with two recurrences ( 8×2) incurs half the error of the purely non-recurrent
model ( 16×1) for OOD problems and enjoys increased accuracy on 100+ OOD problems.
Finally, in Appendix A.7.3, we vary the effective depth of the models to analyze the impact of
parameter count on this task, across Abacus, FIRE and NoPE embeddings. Although the experiments
presented in Figure 4 are a fair comparison across depth, the purely standard transformer models
have many more parameters than their recurrent counterparts. In Table 3 in the appendix, we record
the parameter counts to the nearest million.
4 Pushing the Limits of Algorithmic Reasoning for Transformers
While there is an emphasis on addition as a difficult problem in existing work, our method’s strong
performance allows us to extend to even more difficult problems, including multiplication and sorting
and even multiple operations at once.
4.1 Addition and Subtraction
We train models on a dataset made up of an even mix of addition and subtraction samples. In Figure
5, we show results from models with 8 layers in the recurrent block and 2 recurrences trained with
exactly the same hyperparameters used to train the addition models above. We see that these small
transformer models can simultaneously learn to extrapolate for both the symmetric operation of
addition and the anti-symmetric operation of subtraction using Abacus Embeddings.

training on size 20data. We see that a recurrent model with eight layers in the recurrent block and
two recurrences is the most accurate of all effective depth 16models, halving the error rate of a
standard model with input injection in the OOD evaluation. (See Figure 17 for results with FIRE and
NoPE.)
4.2 Integer Multiplication
We now study a harder task, multiplication of natural numbers, where the length of the output may be
the sum of the lengths of the operands. Compared to addition, where the output is at most one digit
more than the longest operand, multiplication has longer-distance dependency and the output length
scales much faster as problem size increases.
To adapt from addition to multiplication, we make some small changes to our set-up. First, we
remove the input injection from inside the recurrent block and second, we divide the gradients in the
recurrent block by the number of recurrences, down-weighing the gradient update from batches with
many recurrences [Bansal et al., 2022]. (We analyze the impact of these design decisions for addition
models in Appendix Figure 19.) We only examine looped transformers as the compute required for
training and hyperparameter search for multiplication is far greater than for addition, limiting us to a
much smaller scale analysis.
Abacus Embeddings help looped transformers reach near-perfect accuracy in-distribution for mul-
tiplication. In Figure 6, we show how the training distribution, surrounded by the red square fully
saturates with Abacus Embeddings. In fact, models with our Abacus Embeddings achieve higher in

padding each operand to the same length with zeros. In particular, we highlight that the specific
problems that models trained with FIRE embeddings struggle to solve are the hardest problems in the
training set and Abacus Embeddings outperform them in this key area (see the lower right corner of
the red boxes in Figure 6).

sorting arrays of multiple variable length num-
bers, a more challenging testbed for evaluat-
ing the generalization abilities of our Abacus
Embeddings. We present each sorting problem
using alphabetical indices for each (reversed)
number in an input array where the expected
output is the alphabetical indices in ascending
order. For example, a: 64957 , b: 99963 , c:
10218 , d: 7141 , e: 05781 = d, e, b, a, c . We
train with arrays of up to 10numbers each hav-
ing up to 10digits and then evaluate with arrays
of up to 30numbers each having up to 30digits.
We give more detail on the sorting data construc-
tion process in Appendix A.2.
In this setting, we explore two axes of general-
ization. First, we increase the maximum pos-
sible length of the input numbers to 30digits
while maintaining the maximum array length to
10and refer to this scenario as “OOD (number
length - 30).” Second, we increase the number
of inputs in the array to be sorted to 30while
keeping the maximum digit length of each num-
ber at 10and term this scenario “OOD (array
length - 30).” Finally, we consider a scenario where both axes are increased simultaneously, referred
to as “all OOD.”
In Table 1, we illustrate the performance of a standard transformer (eight layers) tra","The researchers in this paper wanted to see if large language models like Transformers can do simple math when they encounter numbers in the text they're reading. Language models are AI systems that are trained on huge amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. The key question the researchers explored is: if you give a Transformer model numbers embedded in text, can it learn to do basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication on those numbers? The researchers tried different ways of representing the numbers within the Transformer's inputs and found that the choice of numerical embedding can make a big difference in the model's ability to reason about the numbers. When the Transformers were given the right kind of numerical embeddings, they were able to learn how to do simple arithmetic. However, the models still struggled with more complex math or with generalizing their numerical reasoning skills beyond the specific examples they were trained on. The paper provides insights into the strengths and limitations of Transformers when it comes to learning to work with numerical information in text."
45,Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Geometric Perspective,"context length: 100and number of heads: 10. We observe that both context length and number of
heads are inducing an increase in the number of regions spanned by the MLP in the input space, which
improves the approximation capabilities of the LLM. This result coincides with our geometrical
description.
that the number of heads as well as the context length are ways to increase the intrinsic dimension of
the MLP input, therefore increasing its capability to generate dense partitions.
We now propose to analyze how using this geometrical relationship as a tool to increase the expressive
power of LLM can lead to better reasoning capabilities.
3Experiment: Increasing LLM expressive power does improve its reasoning
ability
In this section, we are analyzing the capabilities of LLMs to answer reasoning questions through the
lens of the aforementioned geometric analysis. Specifically, we are questioning how the increase
in a number of regions induced by the MLP can lead to better reasoning capabilities. In fact, it is
clear that approximation capabilities and generalization are not equivalent notions. However, it is
not yet determined that the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are tied to their generalization. While

block in the input space of the LLM concerning the number of attention heads and context length.
(Right ) Zoom in on two rows of the left figure, specifically for several attention heads: 5,10. We
observe that increasing both attention heads and context length does increase the number of regions,
which as mentioned, leads to better approximation properties. It is important to note that, while
changing the number of attention heads can be tedious and require pre-training or fine-tuning, one
can seamlessly vary the context length. There is therefore a way to improve LLM approximation
capability without interacting with the weights of the model.
these notions are still hard to pinpoint, we will focus in this experimental section on the relationship
between intrinsic dimension, thus expressive power, and reasoning capabilities.
We propose two experiments to demonstrate that there is an intriguing correlation between them. For
our experiments, we utilized the GSM8K-Zero dataset to assess the model’s performance in generating
correct answers across different few-shot scenarios, ranging from 0to10shots. Specifically, for
each sample and each 1to10-shot condition, we examined how the intrinsic dimension of the model
varied across different layers when compared to the 0-shot baseline. Additionally, we evaluated how
these variations influenced the quality of the model’s responses. In the first experiment reported in
Figure 6, the few shot examples are question-answer pairs randomly sampled from the GSM8K-Zero
training set. For the second experiment reported in Figure 7, these few shot examples are random
tokens.
From these experiments, we make the following observations: (i)pre-pending the question at hand
with any type of token does increase the intrinsic dimension at the first layer. In fact, the first layer
attention graph behaves as a uniform distribution over the tokens, however, this increase is not
necessarily correlated with the reasoning capability of the model as the random token experiment
demonstrates Figure 7. (ii)We observe that when the pre-pended tokens lead to an increase in the
intrinsic dimension at the final layer of the model, the reasoning capabilities of the LLM improve
significantly. This improvement is reflected in a higher percentage of questions being answered
correctly.
In Figure 8, we display the variation in intrinsic dimension of the 1to10shots sampled with respect
to0for each layer. We clearly see that no matter the size of the model, the last layers ID are highly
informative regarding the correctness of the response. While the first layers seem to have a huge
variation in ID whether the output is correct or not, the variance is too large to be significant and
reliable.
These experiments highlight the correlation between a model’s expressive power and its reasoning
capabilities. As discussed in section 2, enhancing this expressive power can be achieved by increasing
the dimension of the input to the MLP blocks. This relationship suggests that more complex input
contributes to the improved reasoning performance of the model.
In LLMs, adding context to the prompt can increase the ID (depending on how related is the context
to the question), and therefore increase the number of piece-wise affine maps produced by the MLP.
One should note that, for an LLM, each token output by the self-attention head is independently
transformed by the MLP. Thus, an MLP with a finer partition will have a more adaptive affine map
for each token. If we think about this from an approximation standpoint, as the tokens are linearly
combined to produce their predictions, the approximation error that is independently applied to each
of them by the MLP can compound easily, and therefore, the more precise the partitioning around

dimension of the input concerning the base prompt, where the ID is computed at the final layer,
and(ii)the correctness in the output generated by the LLM. We evaluate the response generated by
prompting a Mixtral 8×22B Instruct model. We observe that the higher the ID change, the higher
the probability of obtaining a correct response from the LLM.

prepended variants obtained through randomly sampled tokens or permuted text in the few-shot
examples. We observe that the increase in ID is limited in the examples ( <60) and even negative for
the random token case. Consequently, obtaining a correct response is saturated and averages out to
around 40%, which is similar to the case with the 8B model and few-shot examples.

these tokens, the less the approximation error in the prediction. An aspect that has not been explored
here as well as in most work is how these notions are tied to the generalization capabilities, if any, of
LLMs.
In LLMs, incorporating additional context into the prompt can increase the intrinsic dimension of
the model, particularly if the context is closely related to the question. This increase in ID leads
to a greater number of piece-wise affine maps produced by the MLP. It’s important to note that in
LLMs, each token output by the self-attention mechanism is independently transformed by the MLP.
Consequently, an MLP with a more refined partitioning scheme will apply a more adaptive affine
map to each token.

samples), along with their prepended variants where 1to10fixed few-shot examples are used. For
each input, we collect (i)the change in the intrinsic dimension of the input with respect to the base
prompt, where the ID is computed at the final layer, and (ii)the correctness in the output generated
by the LLM. We evaluate the response generated by prompting a Mixtral 8×22B Instruct model.
We observe that the higher the ID change, the higher the probability of obtaining a correct response
from the LLM.
From an approximation perspective, since the model’s predictions are formed by linearly combining
these embedded tokens, the approximation error can accumulate across tokens. Therefore, finer
partitioning around the tokens reduces the approximation error in the final prediction.
An intriguing aspect that remains largely unexplored in this work, as well as in most related research,
is how these geometric insights into intrinsic dimension and affine map partitioning relate to the
generalization capabilities of LLMs. This connection could offer valuable insights into the robustness
and adaptability of these models in various contexts.
4 Related Work
The success of transformer-based models [ 10] across various input modalities has spurred significant
research into the understanding of their internal mechanisms. Our work follows the lead of several
key works on this topic. The difference, however, between these previous works and ours is the
lens of analysis: we focus, fundamentally, on an end-to-end geometric perspective rather than a
mechanistic framework [ 19] or pattern analysis through empirical results [ 20–22]. Our work is also
different from these prior works in that we study the impact of model size and context length in
transformer models and their role in reasoning capabilities, a critical aspect of modern LLMs whose
understanding is largely absent.

Theoretical works for understanding the reasoning capabilities of LLMs make use of input-output
relationships through different frameworks in a domain-specific manner. [ 23–25] make use of
graph problems to understand the expressiveness of LLMs and associate them with the algorithmic
complexity of the graph problem. [ 26–28] use algorithmic reasoning as a way to understand the
limitations of LLMs reasoning abilities. [ 29] investigate arithmetic learning and the impact of input
formatting on LLM reasoning. Closely related, [ 30] investigates the ability of LLMs to learn group
actions. [ 31] consider a two-layer causal transformer and evaluate its generalization capability for
copying, reversing, and sorting operations.
Other studies on transformers focus on initialization and training dynamics [ 32–35]. Albeit resorting
to simplifying assumptions, these works shed light on the role of different components, such as
the residual connection. The embedding geometry in the intermediate and last layers has also been
explored previously. [ 36] provides empirical insights about the position and context embeddings, [ 36]
presents an asymptotic (both in data and model) analysis to explain the emergent abilities of LLMs
through latent space modeling, and [ 37] identifies linear subspaces in contextualized embeddings to
demonstrate geometric structure in LLMs.
Other works [ 38–40] have studied the role of capacity in understanding LLMs and their transfer
performance. In particular, [ 39] empirically observed the role of intrinsic dimension (embedding
dimension) in LLMs and its impact on generalization and downstream task representations. We note
that our approach generalizes these observations while accommodating the sequence dimension, i.e.,
unlike previous works that relied on the dimension of entire sentences or tasks for their study, our
geometric study presents a context-dependent analysis of LLMs.
Our work makes use of several mathematical tools developed with deep neural networks, in general, to
understand transformer architecture. These observations, individually, may not be novel or have been
implicitly noted in the literature. Notably, the spline view of neural networks was previously presented
[41], which considered a partitioning of a fixed dimensional input space by the non-linearities in
the network. Moreover, we note that the mathematical ideas presented in this work are likely
implicitly known to researchers and practitioners familiar with transformers, and our contribution lies
in leveraging this understanding to build a geometric interpretation of transformers.
5 Discussion and Open Questions
We presented here some aspects of DNNs and LLMs geometry, where in particular, we show the
importance of the input space partitioning induced by the MLPs exploiting their piece-wise affine
formulation. The adaptive partitioning of DNN in general plays a huge role in their approximation
capability. In fact, as opposed to traditional spline, the regions induced by the MLP in their input space
are data-dependent, and henceforth determined during training. We showed how such an interplay
between approximation and the number of regions impacts the ability of LLMs to approximate
functions. Then, we show that, while approximation power is not equivalent to generalization, it
seems to be highly correlated to the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we provided a brief
overview of the underlying theory and a limited set of experiments related to these concepts. We
believe that further exploration of this phenomenon is crucial to enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. Our hope is that through this, smaller LLMs can soon bridge the performance gap with
their larger counterparts.

12","Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have shown impressive language understanding and generation capabilities. However, their reasoning abilities are still limited. This paper looks at LLMs from a geometric perspective to understand how their internal structure and representations affect their reasoning skills. The key idea is that the input space of an LLM - the space of all possible inputs it can process - is partitioned into regions. Each region corresponds to a different type of reasoning or task that the model can perform. The size and shape of these regions determine the model's expressive power and the types of reasoning it can engage in. For example, an LLM may be very good at answering factual questions but struggle with open-ended reasoning tasks. This is because the regions in its input space that correspond to factual question-answering are larger and more well-defined, while the regions for open-ended reasoning are more amorphous and difficult for the model to navigate. By understanding this geometric view of LLM input spaces, researchers can work on ways to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models . This could involve techniques like expanding the size and shape of the reasoning regions or introducing new computational primitives to enable more complex reasoning . Ultimately, this geometric perspective offers a novel way to think about the capabilities and limitations of large language models, with the goal of creating models that can truly generate new knowledge and engage in sophisticated mathematical and scientific reasoning ."

Abstract
We introduce Chronos , a simple yet effective framework for pretrained probabilistic time
series models. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into
a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on
these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models
based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of
publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via
Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of
42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show
thatChronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were
part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot
performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them .
Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse
domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained
models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.
1 Introduction
Time series forecasting is an essential component of decision-making across various domains, including retail,
energy, finance, healthcare, climate science, among others. Traditionally, forecasting has been dominated by
statistical models such as ARIMA and ETS. These have served as reliable tools, at least until the recent shift
towards deep learning techniques (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018; Benidis et al., 2022). This shift can be
attributed to the availability of large and diverse time series data sources, and the emergence of operational
forecasting problems (Kolassa & Januschowski, 2019) that play to the strengths of deep forecasters, i.e., the
ability to extract patterns out of a large collection of time series. Despite their impressive performance, deep
forecasters still operate in the standard regime of training and prediction on the same dataset. While there
have been works dedicated to transfer learning (Ye & Dai, 2018) and domain adaptation (Jin et al., 2022)
for forecasting, the field has yet to converge on a unified, general-purpose forecasting model, a goal that
remains a beacon for time series researchers.
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) with zero-shot learning capabilities has ignited interest
in developing “foundation models” for time series. In the context of LLMs, this interest has been pursued
through two main avenues: directly prompting pretrained LLMs in natural language (Gruver et al., 2023;

Xue & Salim, 2023) and fine-tuning LLMs for time series tasks (Zhou et al., 2023a; Jin et al., 2024). However,
these methods face significant limitations, notably the need for prompt engineering or fine-tuning for each
new task, or reliance on large-scale models (GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), etc.)
that demand substantial computational resources and time for inference. Recent concurrent work (Dooley
et al., 2023; Das et al., 2023; Rasul et al., 2023; Woo et al., 2024) also explores pretraining transformer-based
models with sophisticated time-series-specific designs on a large corpus of real and (or) synthetic time series
data.
In this work, we take a step back and ask: what are the fundamental differences between a language model
that predicts the next token, and a time series forecasting model that predicts the next values? Despite the
apparent distinction — tokens from a finite dictionary versus values from an unbounded, usually continuous
domain — both endeavors fundamentally aim to model the sequential structure of the data to predict future
patterns. Shouldn’t good language models “just work” on time series? This naive question prompts us to
challenge the necessity of time-series-specific modifications, and answering it led us to develop Chronos ,
a language modeling framework minimally adapted for time series forecasting. Chronos tokenizes time
series into discrete bins through simple scaling and quantization of real values. In this way, we can train
off-the-shelf language models on this “language of time series,” with no changes to the model architecture
(see Figure 1 for a high-level depiction of Chronos ). Remarkably, this straightforward approach proves
to be effective and efficient, underscoring the potential for language model architectures to address a broad
range of time series problems with minimal modifications.

only model. The model is trained using the cross-entropy loss. ( Right) During inference, we autoregressively sample
tokens from the model and map them back to numerical values. Multiple trajectories are sampled to obtain a
predictive distribution.
For the development of a useful general-purpose time series forecasting model, the scarcity of publicly
available time series datasets, both in quantity and quality, is arguably more critical than the modeling
framework. In addition to the comprehensive collection of public datasets we used to train Chronos , a
central aspect of our approach is the integration of data augmentation strategies, including TSMixup and
KernelSynth. TSMixup randomly samples a set of base time series from different training datasets, and
generates new time series based on a convex combination of them; KernelSynth uses Gaussian processes
to generate synthetic time series by randomly composing kernel functions. These techniques address the
inherent limitations of small training datasets in time series forecasting, enhancing model robustness and
generalization.
Our comprehensive evaluation across 42 datasets establishes Chronos as a benchmark for both in-domain
and zero-shot forecasting, surpassing both traditional models and task-specific deep learning approaches.

Notably, Chronos achieves impressive zero-shot forecasting performance out of the box, without necessi-
tating task-specific adjustments. Its accuracy, coupled with its relatively modest model size, positions it as
a preferable alternative to larger, more computationally demanding models for zero-shot forecasting appli-
cations. By its very nature as a language model operating over a fixed vocabulary, Chronos can seamlessly
integrate with future advancements in LLMs, making it an ideal candidate for further development as a
generalist time series model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background on time series forecasting
and language models, and discusses related work. In Section 3, we describe Chronos , our proposed language
modeling framework for time series. Section 4 discusses our data augmentation technique and synthetic time
series generation process. In Section 5, we present our main results and a rigorous analysis of different design
choices. We discuss future directions in Section 6, and conclude the paper in Section 7. Additional material
is presented in the appendices.
2 Background and Related Work
Time series forecasting concerns using historical data from a quantity of interest (typically real-valued)
to predict their future values. Formally, given a uniformly-spaced time series x1:C= [x1,...,xC], we are
interested in predicting the joint distribution of the next Hsteps,p(xC+1:C+H|x1:C).In this work, we focus
onunivariate forecasting, where the observations are scalars, i.e., xi∈Rfor alli.
Time series forecasting can be addressed with a variety of different methods which can be broadly categorized
into classical forecasting methods and deep learning methods. Classical forecasting methods such as ETS,
ARIMA (Hyndman et al., 2008), Theta (Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000) fit a separate model to each
time series independently (hence referred to as localmodels). In contrast, deep learning forecasting models
learn across time series in a given dataset (and are called globalmodels). These methods leverage advances
in deep learning, such as RNNs which are used by DeepState (Rangapuram et al., 2018), DeepFactor (Wang
et al., 2019), DeepAR (Salinas et al., 2020), TimeGrad (Rasul et al., 2021), and transformers which are
used by TFT (Lim et al., 2021) and PatchTST (Nie et al., 2023). Apart from the choice of architecture,
these approaches differ in the way they model the target, with some modeling the density function while
others directly predicting a set of quantiles (Wen et al., 2017; Gasthaus et al., 2019; Park et al., 2022).
Nevertheless, not all models produce probabilistic forecasts: notably, models such as Informer (Zhou et al.,
2021) and DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023) only produce point forecasts.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on various natural language
processing tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Given a sequence of input to-
kens,w1:k= [w1,...,wk], language models aim to predict the next token, wk+1, by modeling the conditional
distribution, p(wk+1|w1:k). Thetokensbelongtoavocabulary, V, andmaybecharacters, subwords(Sennrich
et al., 2015), or words, depending on the tokenization scheme used.
MostmodernLLMs(Brownetal.,2020;Chungetal.,2022;Touvronetal.,2023)arebasedonthetransformer
architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). The original transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder model
designed for machine translation. The encoder maps an input sentence of some language to a continuous
representation, and the decoder generates the translation token-by-token using the input representation
and previously decoded tokens. Many popular language models, such as BART (Lewis et al., 2019) and
T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022), belong to this family. Another popular architecture for LLMs is
decoder-only, used in GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), where the model only
attends to tokens up to the current token. LLMs are typically trained on a very large corpus of text with
their number of parameters ranging from millions (Raffel et al., 2020) to hundreds of billions (Chowdhery
et al., 2023). We refer the reader to Zhao et al. (2023) for a recent survey on this area of research.
LLM-based forecasters. Inspired by the success of pretrained LLMs, recent work has shown that LLMs
are general pattern recognizers (Mirchandani et al., 2023) and several methods adapting LLMs to the time
seriesdomainhavebeendeveloped. Onelineofworktreatsnumericaltimeseriesdataasrawtextanddirectly
uses the pretrained LLMs with minimal or no fine tuning to forecast unseen time series. PromptCast (Xue &
Salim, 2023) leverages pretrained LLMs for forecasting by transforming the time series data into text-based

input and output pairs and reformulating the forecasting problem as a question answering task. However,
PromptCast requires dataset-specific templates for converting numerical data to text prompts. Perhaps the
most straightforward LLM-based forecasting model is LLMTime (Gruver et al., 2023), which shows clear
evidence for zero-shot forecasting ability of pretrained LLMs on a variety of benchmark time series datasets.
LLMTime proposes a new tokenization scheme that encodes real-valued data as a string of digits after fixing
the numerical precision and scaling the data appropriately. Once encoded as strings, forecasts are obtained
in a zero-shot setting from pretrained LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Llama 2 (Touvron
et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the use of such compute-hungry models hampers the scalability and practical
utility of LLMTime.
Zhou et al. (2023a) propose a unified one-fits-all model (GPT4TS) for different time series analysis tasks
by using a pretrained GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) as a backbone and only fine-tune the positional
embeddingsandtheparametersofthelayernormalizationforeachindividualtask. Insteadofusingtokenized
input, they directly feed the model with patch embeddings, similar to PatchTST (Nie et al., 2023). Recent
concurrent work, Time-LLM (Jin et al., 2024), repurposes LLMs for time series forecasting by aligning
embeddings of time series patches with text prototypes, and prompting the (frozen) LLM with these aligned
embeddings and a natural language prefix describing the task. Unlike Chronos , both GPT4TS and Time-
LLM require in-domain training or fine-tuning, i.e., they are fine-tuned and tested on each dataset separately.
Furthermore, the aforementioned methods are based on prompting or fine-tuning pretrained LLMs. In
contrast, Chronos trains language models from scratch on a large collection of time series, tokenized via
scaling and quantization.
Zero-shot forecasting. Zero-shot forecasting is the ability of models to generate forecasts for time series
from unseen datasets. Some early work (Orozco & Roberts, 2020; Oreshkin et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2022)
in zero-shot forecasting considers training on a single time series dataset and testing on a different dataset.
ForecastPFN (Dooley et al., 2023) tackles the problem of zero-shot forecasting by training a transformer-
based model purely on synthetic data generated according to predefined trend, seasonalities (daily, monthly,
yearly). The trained transformer model is then used to forecast real-world time series in a zero-shot setting.
In this work, we also propose a method to generate synthetic time series data from Gaussian processes
(Section 4.2); however, we use the synthetic data in combination with real data to train Chronos models,
which improves the overall zero-shot performance. Furthermore, Chronos models are probabilistic, whereas
ForecastPFN can only generate point forecasts.
Recent concurrent works (Rasul et al., 2023; Goswami et al., 2024; Das et al., 2023; Woo et al., 2024)
also develop zero-shot forecasting models by pretraining transformer-based architectures on a large corpus
of time series data. These works operate on the real values of the time series and include time-series-
specific designs such as time features, lags, patching, and real-valued distribution heads, among others. In
contrast, Chronos follows a minimalist approach by tokenizing time series values into a fixed vocabulary
and training existing language model architectures on these tokens without any time-series-specific design or
features. That is, Chronos uses a categorical distribution to model the observations, performing regression
via classification.
Other time series tasks. Similar to Zhou et al. (2023a), recent works have studied general purpose
models applicable across time series tasks including imputation, forecasting, classification and anomaly
detection. Wu et al. (2023) develop a task-generic backbone based on the Inception model (Szegedy et al.,
2015). In order to use the CNN-based Inception model, one dimensional time series is transformed into a
two dimensional image-like representation by essentially segmenting the time series based on the periodicity
and stacking the segments. SimMTM (Dong et al., 2023) is a masked pretraining framework for time series
which learns general time series representations that are then used for forecasting and classification via
fine-tuning. Although we focus on univariate time series forecasting in this work, based on its excellent
performance on unseen time series datasets, we hypothesize that Chronos learns general representations
that can potentially be deployed for tasks beyond forecasting.

3 Chronos: A Language Modeling Framework for Time Series
In this section we introduce Chronos , a framework adapting existing language model architectures and
training procedures to probabilistic time series forecasting. While both language and time series are sequen-
tial in nature, they differ in terms of their representation — natural language consists of words from a finite
vocabulary, while time series are real-valued. This distinction necessitates specific modifications to existing
language modeling frameworks, especially concerning tokenization, to make them applicable to time series
data. Nevertheless, since existing transformer models have excelled on language tasks, our design philosophy
involves making minimal changes to the model architectures and training procedure.
3.1 Time Series Tokenization
Consider a time series x1:C+H= [x1,...,xC+H], where the first Ctime steps constitute the historical
context, and the remaining Hrepresent the forecast horizon. Language models operate on tokens from a
finite vocabulary, so using them for time series data requires mapping the observations xi∈Rto a finite set
of tokens. To this end, we first scale and then quantize observations into a fixed number of bins.
Scaling. The scale of time series can differ significantly even within a single dataset. This poses optimiza-
tion challenges for deep learning models. Therefore, individual time series are normalized to facilitate better
optimization. In the case of Chronos , the goal of normalization is to map the time series values into a
suitable range for quantization. A common normalization technique involves applying an affine transforma-
tion to the time series, i.e., ˜xi= (xi−m)/s. Several popular normalization schemes, such as mean scaling,
standard scaling and min-max scaling, can be obtained by appropriately choosing mands. We opt for mean
scaling, a method that has proven effective in deep learning models commonly used for practical time series
applications (Salinas et al., 2020; Rabanser et al., 2020), but other approaches are viable and only require
minimal changes. An attractive feature of mean scaling is that it preserves zero values in the time series,
which are often semantically meaningful, such as zero sales for a product or zero solar energy generation at
night. Mean scaling normalizes individual entries of the time series by the mean of the absolute values in
the historical context. Specifically, this involves setting m= 0ands=1
C/summationtextC
i=1|xi|.
Quantization. The scaled time series ˜x1:C+H= [˜x1,..., ˜xC,..., ˜xC+H], is still real-valued and cannot
be processed directly by language models. To convert these real values into discrete tokens, we employ
quantization. Formally, we select Bbin centers c1<...<c Bon the real line, and B−1edgesbiseparating
them,ci< bi< ci+1, fori∈ {1,...,B−1}. The quantization function q:R→ {1,2,...,B}, and
dequantization d:{1,2,...,B}→R, are then defined as
q(x) =

1if−∞≤x<b 1,
2ifb1≤x<b 2,
...
BifbB−1≤x<∞,andd(j) =cj, (1)
respectively. The positioning of bin centers and edges can either be data-dependent or uniform (Rabanser
et al., 2020). Quantile binning, a type of data-dependent binning, exploits the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the training datapoints to construct bins such that approximately equal number of dat-
apoints are assigned to each bin. In contrast, uniform binning selects uniformly-spaced bin centers within
the interval [c1,cB]and the bin edges fall mid-way between the successive bin centers, i.e., bi=ci+ci+1
2for
i∈{1,...,B−1}. Since the distribution of values for unseen downstream datasets can differ significantly
from the training distribution, we opt for uniform binning in our experiments, but other quantization tech-
niques can be used. We refer the reader to Rabanser et al. (2020) for a detailed discussion on quantization
schemes for time series. A potential limitation of this approach is that the prediction range is restricted
between [c1,cB],making it theoretically infeasible to model time series with a strong trend. We explore this
further in a practical setting in Section 5.7.
Apart from the time series tokens {1,2,...,B}, we include two special tokens, commonly used in language
models, into the time series vocabulary, Vts:PADandEOS. The PADtoken is used to pad time series of different
5
Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
lengths to a fixed length for batch construction and to replace missing values. The EOStoken is appended
to the quantized and padded time series to denote the end of the sequence. While the use of an EOStoken
is not strictly necessary in the case of time series, it makes training and inference using popular language
modeling libraries convenient. The sequences of tokens from Vtscan readily be processed by language models
(both encoder-decoder and decoder only models), to train them as usual. A common approach in time series
modeling is to incorporate time and frequency information, through features such as day-of-week, week-
of-year, and so on. Perhaps counter-intuitively, in Chronos , we ignore time and frequency information,
treating the “time series” simply as a sequence.
We primarily focus on the variants of the encoder-decoder T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020). Additionally, we
conduct an experiment with the GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) model to demonstrate that our approach
can be straightforwardly extended to decoder-only models. No modifications are required to the language
model architecture, except adjusting the vocabulary size to |Vts|, which depends on the number of bins used
for quantization and may be different from the vocabulary size of the original language model. Concretely,
adjusting the vocabulary size entails truncating (or extending) the input and output embedding layers of
the language model.
3.2 Objective Function
As typical in language models, we use the categorical distribution over the elements of Vtsas the output
distribution, p(zC+h+1|z1:C+h)wherez1:C+his the tokenized time series. Chronos is trained to minimize
the cross entropy between the distribution of the quantized ground truth label and the predicted distribution.
Formally, the loss function for a single tokenized time series (also accounting for EOStokens) is given by,
ℓ(θ) =−H+1/summationdisplay
h=1|Vts|/summationdisplay
i=11(zC+h+1=i)logpθ(zC+h+1=i|z1:C+h), (2)
wherepθ(zC+h+1=i|z1:C+h)denotes the categorical distribution predicted by the model parameterized by
θ. In practice, the loss is averaged over a batch of time series during training.
Note that the categorical cross entropy loss (Eq. 2) is not a distance-aware objective function, i.e., it does not
explicitly recognize that bin iis closer to bin i+ 1than toi+ 2. Instead, the model is expected to associate
nearby bins together, based on the distribution of bin indices in the training dataset. In other words,
Chronos performs regression via classification (Torgo & Gama, 1997; Stewart et al., 2023). This is unlike
typical probabilistic time series forecasting models, which either use parametric continuous distributions
such as Gaussian and Student’s-t (Salinas et al., 2020) or perform quantile regression (Wen et al., 2017; Lim
et al., 2021).
Opting for a categorical output distribution offers two key advantages. Firstly, it requires no modification
to the language model architecture or training objective, enabling the use of popular language modeling
libraries and the utilities they provide out of the box (Wolf et al., 2020). Secondly, it imposes no restrictions
on the structure of the output distribution, allowing the model to learn arbitrary distributions, including
multimodal ones. This flexibility proves especially valuable for a pretrained model, as time series datasets
from diverse domains may follow distinct output distribution patterns.
Arguably, modeling the output as an ordinal variable would be more appropriate, since the output domain is
obtained by discretizing the real line. In fact, regression models for ordinal variables have been extensively
studied in the literature (McCullagh, 1980; Winship & Mare, 1984), including for neural networks and
transformer models (Cheng et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2021). Imposing the ordinal nature of the classes on top
of the models, in similar ways to the mentioned literature, could be an interesting extension of this work.
3.3 Forecasting
Chronos models are probabilistic by design and multiple realizations of the future can be obtained by
autoregressively sampling from the predicted distribution, pθ(zC+h+1|z1:C+h), forh∈{1,2,...,H}. These
sample paths come in the form of token IDs that need to be mapped back to real values and then unscaled
6
Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
to obtain the actual forecast. The dequantization function dfrom Eq. (1) maps the predicted tokens to real
values: these are then unscaled by applying the inverse scaling transformation, which in the case of mean
scaling involves multiplying the values by the scale s.
4 Data Augmentation
The quality and quantity of public time series data pales in comparison to the natural language processing
(NLP) domain, which benefits from ample high-quality text datasets such as WikiText-103 (Merity et al.,
2016), C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), and The Pile (Gao et al., 2020). This poses challenges for training models
intendedforzero-shotforecasting, whichrelyonlarge-scaletimeseriesdatawithdiversepatterns. Toaddress
this issue, we propose enhancing the diversity of training data by generating mixup augmentations from real
datasets and supplementing training with synthetic data.
4.1 TSMixup: Time Series Mixup
Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) is a data augmentation scheme proposed in the context of image classi-
fication. It generates convex combinations of random image pairs and their labels from the training
dataset, which alleviates issues such as memorization and overfitting in deep learning models. Exist-
ing works (Carmona et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023b) have extended Mixup to the time series domain.

Accurately forecasting future values in time series data is an important but challenging task. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities in areas like natural language processing and generation. Researchers have begun exploring whether LLMs can also be effective for time series forecasting, with some initial success demonstrated by models like Temporal Fusion Transformer and Tempo . However, the authors of this paper argue that current LLM-based forecasters still struggle with key challenges, such as effectively capturing the intricate patterns and temporal dynamics present in time series data. They introduce Chronos, a new approach that aims to address these limitations by combining the strengths of LLMs with specialized time series architectures and pretraining strategies."

Abstract
Second-order training methods have better convergence properties than gradient
descent but are rarely used in practice for large-scale training due to their computa-
tional overhead. This can be viewed as a hardware limitation (imposed by digital
computers). Here we show that natural gradient descent (NGD), a second-order
method, can have a similar computational complexity per iteration to a first-order
method, when employing appropriate hardware. We present a new hybrid digital-
analog algorithm for training neural networks that is equivalent to NGD in a certain
parameter regime but avoids prohibitively costly linear system solves. Our algo-
rithm exploits the thermodynamic properties of an analog system at equilibrium,
and hence requires an analog thermodynamic computer. The training occurs in
a hybrid digital-analog loop, where the gradient and Fisher information matrix
(or any other positive semi-definite curvature matrix) are calculated at given time
intervals while the analog dynamics take place. We numerically demonstrate the
superiority of this approach over state-of-the-art digital first- and second-order
training methods on classification tasks and language model fine-tuning tasks.
1 Introduction
With the rise of more sophisticated AI models, the cost of training them is exploding, as world-leading
models now cost hundreds of millions of dollars to train. This issue is compounded by the ending of
both Moore’s Law and Dennard’s Law for digital hardware [ 20], which impacts both the runtime
and energy efficiency of such hardware. This highlights a need and an opportunity for specialized,
unconventional hardware targeted at improving the efficiency of training AI models.
Moreover, conventional digital hardware can be viewed as limiting the range of training algorithms
that a user may consider. Researchers are missing an opportunity to co-design novel optimizers to
exploit novel hardware developments. Instead, relatively simplistic optimizers, such as stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), Adam [ 22], and their variants [ 27], are among the most popular methods for
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and other large AI models. More sophisticated optimizers are
rarely used due to the associated computational overhead on digital hardware.
A clear example of this is second-order methods, which capture curvature information of the loss
landscape. These methods, while theoretically more powerful in terms of convergence properties,
remain computationally expensive and harder to use, blocking their adoption. For example, natural
gradient descent (NGD) [ 4,30] involves calculating estimates of second-order quantities such as
the Fisher information matrix and performing a costly linear system solve at every epoch. Some
approximations to NGD, such as the Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) [ 31], have

Preprint. Under review.arXiv:2405.13817v1 [cs.LG] 22 May 2024
shown promise, and K-FAC has shown superior performance to Adam [ 25,14]. However, applying
such methods to arbitrary neural network architectures remains difficult [36].
In this article, we present thermodynamic natural gradient descent (TNGD), a new method to
perform second-order optimization. This method involves a hybrid digital-analog loop, where a GPU
communicates with an analog thermodynamic computer. A nice feature of this paradigm is flexibility:
the user provides their model architecture and the analog computer serves only to accelerate the
training process. This is in contrast to many proposals to accelerate the inference workload of AI
models with analog computing, where the model is hardwired into the hardware, and users are unable
to change the model architecture as they seamlessly would by using their preferred software tools
[21, 6, 11, 1].
The analog computer in TNGD uses thermodynamic processes as a computational resource. Such
thermodynamic devices have previously been proposed [ 10,18,15,9,26], have been theorized to
exhibit runtime and energy efficiency gains [ 2,13], and have been successfully prototyped [ 34,3]. Our
TNGD algorithm represents an instance of algorithmic co-design, where we propose a novel optimizer
to take advantage of a novel hardware paradigm. TNGD exploits a physical Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
process to implement the parameter update rule in NGD. It has a runtime per iteration scaling
linearly in the number of parameters, and when properly parallelized it can be close to the runtime
of first-order optimizers such as Adam and SGD. Hence, it is theoretically possible to achieve the
computational efficiency of a first-order training method while still accounting for the curvature of
the loss landscape with a second-order method. Moreover, our numerics show the competitiveness of
TNGD with first-order methods for classification and extractive question-answering tasks.
2 Related work
There is a large body of theoretical research on natural gradient descent [ 4,30,7] arguing that NGD
requires fewer iterations than SGD to converge to the same value of the loss in specific settings.
While less is known about the theoretical convergence rate of Adam, there exists a large body of
empirical evidence that NGD can converge in fewer iterations than Adam [33, 31, 32, 14, 38, 16].
However, a single iteration of NGD is generally more computationally expensive than that of SGD
or Adam, which have a per-iteration cost scaling linearly in the number of parameters N. NGD
typically has a superlinear (assuming the condition number scales as κ=Nα, α > 0for NGD-CG)
complexity in the number of parameters (although this may be reduced to linear scaling at the expense
of higher-order scaling with batch size and output dimension, see Section 3). K-FAC [ 31] aims to
reduce this complexity and invokes a block-wise approximation of the curvature matrix, which may
not always hold. While first introduced for multi-layer perceptrons, K-FAC has been applied to more
complex architectures, such as recurrent neural networks [ 32] and transformers [ 14], where additional
approximations have to be made and where the associated computational overhead can vary.
There has been significant effort and progress towards reducing the time- and space- complexity of
operations used in the inference workload of AI models, e.g., a variety of “linear attention"" blocks have
been proposed [ 40,19,42]. However, there has been less focus on reducing the complexity of training
methods. While various approaches are taken to accelerating training using novel hardware, these
efforts typically aim at reducing the constant coefficients appearing in the time cost of computation.
Especially relevant to our work, analog computing devices have been proposed to achieve reduced
time and energy costs of training relative to available digital technology [ 21,6,11,1]. These devices
are generally limited to training a neural network that has a specific architecture (corresponding to the
structure of the analog device). To our knowledge, there has not yet been a proposal that leverages
analog hardware to reduce the complexity of training algorithms such as NGD.
Given the existing results implying that fewer iterations are needed for NGD relative to other
commonly used optimizers, we focus on reducing the per-iteration computational cost of NGD
using a hybrid analog-digital algorithm to perform each parameter update. Our algorithm therefore
demonstrates that complexity can be improved in training (not only in inference), and moreover that
the per-iteration complexity of NGD can be made similar to that of a first-order training method.

3 Natural gradient descent
Let us consider a supervised learning setting, where the goal is to minimize an objective function
defined as:
ℓ(θ) =1
|D|X
(x,y)∈DL(y, fθ(x)), (1)
where L(y, fθ(x))∈Ris a loss function, fθ(x)is the forward function that is parametrized by
θ∈RN. These functions depend on input data and labels (x, y)∈ D, with Da given training
dataset. Viewed through the lens of statistics, minimizing the objective function is analogous to
minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the target joint distribution q(x, y)to the
learned distribution p(x, y|θ)[30]. A straightforward way to optimize ℓ(θ)is to follow the direction
of steepest descent, defined by the negative gradient −∇ℓ, defined as:
−∇ℓ
||∇ℓ||= lim
ϵ→01
ϵarg min
d:||d||≤ϵℓ(θ+d), (2)
with|| · || the Euclidean norm. The natural gradient, on the other hand can be defined as the direction
of steepest descent with respect to the KL divergence defined as:
KL(p(x, y|θ+d)||p(x, y|θ)) =ZZ
p(x, y|θ+d) logp(x, y|θ+d)
p(x, y|θ)
dxdy (3)
[5]. One may then Taylor-expand this divergence as
KL(p(x, y|θ+d)||p(x, y|θ)) =1
2d⊤Fd+O(d3), (4)
where Fis the Fisher information matrix [30] (or the Fisher ), defined as:
F=Ep(x,y|θ)[∇logp(x, y|θ)∇logp(x, y|θ)⊤]. (5)
The natural gradient is then simply defined as
˜g=F−1∇ℓ(θ). (6)
For the NGD optimizer, the update rule is then given by:
θk+1=θk−ηF−1∇ℓ, (7)
withηa learning rate. In practice, computing the Fisher information is not always feasible because
one must have access to the density p(x, y|θ). A quantity that is always possible (and relatively
cheap) to compute thanks to auto-differentiation is the empirical Fisher information matrix, defined
as:
¯F=JJ⊤=1

(x,y)∈S∇logp(y|x, θ)∇logp(y|x, θ)⊤, (8)
where logp(y|x, θ) =−L(y, fθ(x)),|S|=bis the batch size and S ⊂ D . The Jacobian matrix J
is defined as
J=1√
b[∇logp(y1|x1, θ),∇logp(y2|x2, θ), . . . ,∇logp(yb|xb, θ)].
Note that the squared gradient appearing in the second moment estimate of the Adam optimizer [ 22]
is the diagonal of the empirical Fisher matrix. Another approximation to the Fisher matrix is the
generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) matrix, defined as:

Figure 1: Overview of Thermodynamic Natural Gradient Descent (TNGD). A GPU that stores
the model architecture and provides the gradient ∇ℓkand Fisher matrix Fk(through its representation
given by the Jacobian Jfand Hessian HLmatrices given by Eq. (9)) at step kis connected to a
thermodynamic computer, called the stochastic processing unit (SPU). At times tk, the estimate of
the natural gradient ˜gkis sent to the GPU, which updates the parameters of the model and calculates
gradients and curvature matrices for some new data batch (xk, yk). During digital auto-differentiation,
the SPU undergoes dynamical evolution, either continuing to approach its steady-state or remaining
in it. After some time, gradient ∇ℓkand Fisher matrix Fkare sent to the SPU through a DAC and
digital controllers. This modifies the dynamics of the SPU, and after some time interval, a new
natural gradient estimate ˜gk+1is sent back to the GPU. Note that the time between two measurements
tk+1−tkneed not be greater than the time between two auto-differentiation calls. The hybrid
digital-thermodynamic process may be used asynchronously as shown in the diagram (where the time
of measurement of ˜gand upload of the gradient and Fisher matrix are not the same).
For loss functions of the exponential family (with natural parameter z), the GGN matches the true
Fisher matrix [ 30]. In addition, we have observed better convergence with the GGN than with the
empirical Fisher (as in other works such as Refs. [ 33,23], where better convergence than with the
Hessian is also observed). Therefore, we will consider the GGN in what follows. Note that the
methods we introduce in this work apply to any second-order optimization algorithm with a positive
semi-definite curvature matrix (by curvature matrix, we mean any matrix capturing information about
the loss landscape). In particular, it applies most efficiently to matrices constructed as outer products
of rectangular matrices (such as the empirical Fisher and the GGN) as explained below.
3.1 Fast matrix vector products
The linear system appearing in Eq. (6)can be solved using the conjugate gradient (CG) method [ 33],
which will be referred to as NGD-CG in what follows. In fact, when ℓis parametrized by a neural
network, the GGN-vector product Gvinvolved in the conjugate gradient algorithm may be evaluated
in runtime O(bN)thanks to fast Jacobian-vector products [ 8] (JVPs). This approach also enables
one to not explicitly construct the Fisher matrix, thus also avoiding a O(bdzN2)runtime cost in
computing it and a O(N2)memory cost in storing it. The efficiency of this approach depends on
the number of CG iterations required to obtain good performance. Importantly, convergence in√κ
steps, with κthe condition number of F, is not required to obtain competitive performance [ 31,16].
Crucially, due to the sequential nature of the algorithm, the CG iterations cannot be parallelized.
In practice, since reaching convergence is computationally expensive, one generally stops the CG
algorithm after a set number of iterations. Because of the way the step size is adapted in CG, we have
observed that the solution after ksteps xkis not necessarily closer to the true solution than the initial
guess x0, in particular for ill-conditioned problems, which can make NGD-CG difficult to use.
3.2 NGD with the Woodbury identity
In the machine learning setting, it is often the case that b≪N(anddz≪N). This means that the
curvature matrix is low-rank and the linear system to solve is underdetermined. To mitigate this issue,
4
the Fisher matrix may be dampened as F+λI. In that case, the Woodbury identity may be used to
obtain the inverse Fisher vector-product F−1vappearing in the NGD update. We have:
F=UV+λI,withU=Jf, V=HLJ⊤
f (10)
F−1=λ−1I−λ−2U(I+λ−1V U)−1V (Woodbury) (11)
F−1v=λ−1I−λ−2U(I+λ−1V U)−1V v (12)
This is included in Ref. [ 38], and can be competitive with NGD-CG when the batch size band output
dimension dzare much smaller than the number of trainable parameters N. Here one must construct
theVmatrix, which has runtime O(d2
zb2N), and invert (I+λ−1V U)which is O(b3d3
z). While the
batch size typically remains small, the value of dzcan make this inversion intractable. For example,
in many language-model tasks, dz∼O(104)is the vocabulary size.
4 Thermodynamic NGD
At a high level, TNGD combines the strength of GPUs (through auto-differentiation) with the strength
of thermodynamic devices at solving linear systems. Regarding the latter, Ref. [ 2] showed that a
thermodynamic device, called a stochastic processing unit (SPU), can solve a linear system Ax=b
with reduced computational complexity relative to standard digital hardware. The solution to the
linear system is found by letting the SPU evolve under an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process given
by the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):
dx=−(Ax−b)dt+N
0,2β−1dt
, (13)
where Ais a positive matrix and βis a positive scalar (which can be seen as the inverse temperature
of the noise). Operationally, one lets the SPU settle to its equilibrium state under the dynamics of
Eq. (13), at which point xis distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution given by:
x∼ N[A−1b, β−1A−1]. (14)
One can see that the first moment of this distribution is the solution to the linear system Ax=b.
Exploiting this approach, TNGD involves a subroutine that estimates the solution to the linear system
in Eq. (6). For this particular linear system, the SDE in Eq. (13) becomes the following:
d˜gk,t=−(Fk−1˜gk,t− ∇ℓk−1)dt+N[0,2κ0dt] (15)
=−(J⊤
f,k−1HL,k−1Jf,k−1˜gk,t− ∇ℓk−1)dt+N[0,2κ0dt] (16)
with ˜gk,tthe value of the natural gradient estimate at time tandκ0the variance of the noise.
Comparing Eqs. (13) and(15), we see that in the equilibrium state (i.e. for large t), the mean of ˜gk,t
provides an estimate of the natural gradient, in other words:
˜gk:= lim
t→∞⟨˜gk,t⟩=F−1
k−1∇ℓk−1. (17)
The overall TNGD algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1. Using the current parameter estimates θk, the
GPU computes the matrices JfandHL, and the vector ∇ℓ, which can be accomplished efficiently
using auto-differentiation. The matrices Jf,J⊤
f, and HL, as well as the vector ∇ℓ, are uploaded
to component values (see Appendix) on the SPU, which is then allowed to equilibrate under the
dynamics of Eq. (15). Next, samples are taken of ˜gt,k, and are sent from the SPU to the GPU, where
samples are averaged to yield an estimate of ˜gk. Finally, the parameters are updated using the equation
θk+1=θk−η˜gk, (18)
and this process may be repeated until sufficient convergence is achieved (other update equations
may also be employed, see Section 5).
While Eq. (17) involves a long time limit, numerical evidence (see section 5) shows that samples
may be taken even before equilibrium has been reached without harming performance significantly.
Thus, the analog dynamics time tis an important hyperparameter of TNGD. Furthermore, another
hyperparameter arises from the delay time td, defined as the time between a measurement of θkand
the update of the gradient and GGN on the device. As discussed in Section 5, a non-zero delay time
is not necessarily detrimental to performance and can in fact improve it.

GGN-vector products and has the same memory cost as first-order methods. NGD-Woodbury can be
performed by constructing the matrix V U, and using the formula given by Eq. (12). This results in a
runtime cost dominated by constructing V Uand inverting it, which also requires its storage.

values of dz. The same network is used and dzis varied (this also has the effect of varying the N).
Error bars are displayed as shaded area but are smaller than the data markers.
In addition to the advantage in time- and energy-efficiency, TNGD has another advantage over
NGD-CG in terms of stability. For some pathological linear systems, CG fails to converge and instead
diverges. However, the thermodynamic algorithm is guaranteed to converge (on average) for any
positive definite matrix. To see this, note that the mean of ˜gk,tevolves according to
⟨˜gk,t⟩= exp ( −Fk−1t)(˜gk,0−F−1
k−1∇ℓk−1) +F−1
k−1∇ℓk−1. (19)
There is still variance associated with the estimator of ⟨˜gk,t⟩(the sample mean), but the sample
mean converges to the solution with high probability in all cases. We also note that if we choose
˜gk,0=∇ℓk−1, we obtain a smooth interpolation between SGD ( t= 0) and NGD ( t=∞).
4.1 Computational complexity and performance
The runtime complexity of TNGD and other second-order optimization (that do not make assumptions
on the structure of G, hence excluding K-FAC) algorithms is reported in Table 1. As explained,
Thermodynamic NGD (TNGD) has a runtime and memory cost dominated by the construction and

of the loss. The tfactor denotes the analog runtime, and may be interpreted similarly to cfor
NGD-CG as a parameter controlling the approximation. For each optimizer the number of model
calls is reported. For all optimizers except NGD-CG these calls can be easily parallelized thanks to
vectorizing maps in PyTorch.
In Fig. 2 a comparison of the runtime per iteration of the four second-order optimizers considered is
shown. Fig. 2(a) shows the runtime as a function of the number of parameters N. The scaling of NGD
asN3can be observed, and the NGD-CG data is close to flat, meaning the model calls parallelize
well for the range of parameter count considered. The linear scaling of NGD-Woodbury and TNGD
is also shown, although with a different overall behaviour due to parallelization and a much shorter
runtime per iteration for TNGD. This shows that for the given range of Natdz= 20 , we can expect
a 100×speedup over second-order optimizers. Fig. 2(b) shows the dependence of runtime on the
output dimension dzfor the second-order optimizers. These results indicate that TNGD is most
competitive for intermediate values of dz. Finally we note that with better hardware, the scaling with
bothNanddzwould be better, as the operations to construct the Hessian and Jacobian can be more
efficiently parallelized for larger values.
5 Experiments
5.1 MNIST classification
We first consider the task of MNIST classification [ 24]. For our experiments, we use a simple
convolutional neural network consisting of a convolutional layer followed by two feedforward layers,
and we digitally simulate the TNGD algorithm (see App. D). The goal of these experiments is twofold:
(1) to compare the estimated performance per runtime of TNGD against popular first-order optimizers
such as Adam, and (2) to provide some insights on other features of TNGD, such as its performance
as a function of the analog runtime tas well as its asynchronous execution as a function of the delay
timetd.
In Fig. 3(a), the training and test losses as a function of runtime for both Adam (measured) and
TNGD (estimated) are presented. To estimate the TNGD runtime, we took into account results for its
runtime per iteration as presented in the previous section, finding an overall 2×runtime per iteration
with respect to Adam for this problem on an A100 GPU. One can see from the figure that even while
taking into account the difference in runtime per iteration, TNGD still outperforms Adam, especially
at the initial stages of the optimization. Interestingly, it also generalizes better for the considered
experimental setup. In Fig.3(b), the training and test accuracies are shown. We again see TNGD

largely outperforming Adam, reaching the same training accuracy orders of magnitude faster, while
also displaying a better test accuracy. These results are reminiscent of prior work on NGD [ 33],
however here the batch size is smaller than in other works, indicating that even a noisy GGN matrix
improves the optimization.
As mentioned previously, the continuous-time nature of TNGD allows one to interpolate smoothly
between first- ( t= 0) and second- ( t=∞) order optimization, with a given optimizer choice
(whether the optimizer update rule is that of SGD or that of Adam as described in Alg. 1). In
Fig. 4(a), the training loss vs. iterations is shown for various analog dynamics times. These results
clearly demonstrate the effect mentioned above, where increasing the analog runtime improves
performances continuously until it approaches that of exact NGD for t∼50τ. In Fig. 4(b), the
same quantity is shown for a fixed analog dynamics time t, and varying delay times td. This
leads to a quadratic approximation of the objective function that is inaccurate (since the GGN and
gradients are calculated for parameters different than the value around which the objective function is
approximated). However, this results in an improved performance, even for a small delay time. A
likely explanation of this result is that the state of the device retains information about the curvature
of the previous quadratic approximation, while being subject to the updated quadratic approximation.
This effect propagates across iterations which is reminiscent of momentum.
5.2 Language model fine-tuning
In this section we show how thermodynamic NGD may be applied to language modeling tasks, in
more practically relevant settings than MNIST classification. We consider the DistilBert model [ 39]
which we fine-tune on the Stanford question-answering dataset (SQuaD) [ 37], a common dataset to
evaluate model comprehension of technical domains through extractive question-answering. As is
commonly performed when fine-tuning, we apply a low-rank adaptation [ 17] to the model, which
reduces its trainable parameters (details about this procedure are in App. E) to a manageable amount
(75khere) for limited compute resources.
Figure 5(a) displays a comparison of the training loss for different optimizers. The bare TNGD (as
used in the previous section) shows a worse performance than Adam in this setting. However, a
hybrid approach, TNGD-Adam, where the natural gradient estimate is used in conjunction with the
Adam update rule gives the best performance (this is explained in App. B). One possible explanation
for this result is that there are two pre-conditionings of the gradient for TNGD-Adam: the first comes
from the natural gradient, which incorporates curvature information, and the second comes from the
Adam update rule, which acts as a signal-noise ratio as explained in Ref. [ 22], which further adjusts
the natural gradient values. In Fig. 5(b), we show that the same results as in the previous section
apply to TNGD-Adam, where increasing the analog runtime boosts performance. Therefore, the

analog runtime in TNGD may be viewed as a resource in this sense, that is computationally very
cheap (as time constants can be engineered to be very small).
6 Limitations
The practical impact of our work relies on the future availability of analog thermodynamic computers,
such as a scaled up version of the system in Ref. [ 34]. We provide a circuit diagram of a potential
thermodynamic computer in the Appendix. Such computers can employ standard electrical compo-
nents and leverage CMOS-based fabrication infrastructure, and hence are likely straightforward to
scale up, although that remains to be demonstrated.
Analog computers, in general, tend to face precision issues, whereby the solution accuracy is limited
by the precision of the electrical components. For analog thermodynamic computers, it is possible
to mitigate this issue through an averaging technique [ 3], and the method proposed in Ref. [ 3] can
be directly applied to the TNGD algorithm to improve solution accuracy. Nevertheless, we suspect
that training-based applications will have a significant tolerance to precision-based errors, although a
detailed study is needed to confirm that hypothesis. We note that there is a growing body of work on
very low-precision inference [ 28] and training [ 41] which indicates that high numerical precision is
not crucial for good performance in machine learning. We also remark that thermodynamic computers
are predicted to be robust to stochastic noise sources since stochasticity is a key component of such
computers [9], as is shown in Fig. 7 in the Appendix.
We have numerically tested TNGD for","Training machine learning models, especially large neural networks, is a complex and computationally intensive process. The most common approach, called gradient descent, updates the model's parameters by following the direction that reduces the error the fastest. However, gradient descent can be slow to converge, meaning it takes a long time to find the best set of parameters. An alternative approach called natural gradient descent has been shown to converge faster, but it requires more complex calculations that are too slow for practical use on large models. This paper introduces a new hybrid method that combines digital and analog computing to get the benefits of natural gradient descent without the computational overhead. The key idea is to use a special analog hardware device, called an ""analog thermodynamic computer,"" to handle the most computationally intensive parts of the natural gradient descent algorithm. This analog device can perform the necessary calculations much faster than a traditional digital computer. The training process then alternates between the digital and analog components, with the digital part calculating the gradients and other information, and the analog part updating the model parameters. The authors show that this hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art digital training methods on several benchmark tasks, demonstrating the potential of combining analog and digital computing for efficient model training."

ensuring seamless stitching and offering precise control over eyes and lip movements.
Abstract
Portrait animation aims to synthesize a lifelike video from
a single source image, using it as an appearance reference,
with motion (i.e., facial expressions and head pose) derived
from a driving video, audio, text, or generation. Instead of
following mainstream diffusion-based methods, we explore
and extend the potential of the implicit-keypoint-based frame-
work, which effectively balances computational efficiency
and controllability. Building upon this, we develop a video-
driven portrait animation framework named LivePortrait
with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and
efficiency for practical usage. To enhance the generation
∗Equal contributions.†Corresponding author.quality and generalization ability, we scale up the train-
ing data to about 69 million high-quality frames, adopt a
mixed image-video training strategy, upgrade the network
architecture, and design better motion transformation and
optimization objectives. Additionally, we discover that com-
pact implicit keypoints can effectively represent a kind of
blendshapes and meticulously propose a stitching and two re-
targeting modules, which utilize a small MLP with negligible
computational overhead, to enhance the controllability. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
even compared to diffusion-based methods. The generation
speed remarkably reaches 12.8ms on an RTX 4090 GPU with
PyTorch. The inference code and models are available at

1. Introduction
Nowadays, people frequently use smartphones or other
recording devices to capture static portraits to record their
precious moments. The Live Photos1feature on iPhone can
bring static portraits to life by recording the moments 1.5
seconds before and after a picture is taken, which is likely
achieved through a form of video recording. However, based
on recent advances like GANs [ 1] and Diffusions [ 2–4], vari-
ous portrait animation methods [ 5–13] have made it possible
to animate a static portrait into dynamic ones, without rely-
ing on specific recording devices.
In this paper, we aim to animate a static portrait image,
making it realistic and expressive, while also pursuing high
inference efficiency and precise controllability. Although
diffusion-based portrait animation methods [ 12–14] have
achieved impressive results in terms of quality, they are usu-
ally computationally expensive and lack the precise controlla-
bility, e.g., stitching control2. Instead, we extensively explore
implicit-keypoint-based video-driven frameworks [ 5,11],
and extend their potential to effectively balance the general-
ization ability, computational efficiency, and controllability.
Specifically, we first enhance a powerful implicit-
keypoint-based method [ 5], by scaling up the training data to
about 69 million high-quality portrait images, introducing a
mixed image-video training strategy, upgrading the network
architecture, using the scalable motion transformation, de-
signing the landmark-guided implicit keypoints optimization
and several cascaded loss terms. Additionally, we discover
that compact implicit keypoints can effectively represent
a kind of implicit blendshapes, and meticulously design a
stitching module and two retargeting modules, which utilize
a small MLP and add negligible computational overhead, to
enhance the controllability, such as stitching control. Our
core contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) devel-
oping a solid implicit-keypoint-based video-driven portrait
animation framework that significantly enhances the gener-
ation quality and generalization ability, and (ii) designing
an advanced stitching module and two retargeting modules
for better controllability, with negligible computational over-
head. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effi-
cacy of our framework, even compared to heavy diffusion-
based methods. Besides, our model can generate a portrait
animation in 12.8ms on an RTX 4090 GPU using PyTorch
for inference.
2. Related Work
Recent video-driven portrait animation methods can be di-
vided into non-diffusion-based and diffusion-based methods,
as summarized in Tab. 1.

2https://www.d-id.com/liveportrait-42.1. Non-diffusion-based Portrait Animation
For non-diffusion-based models, the implicit-keypoints-
based methods employed implicit keypoints as the interme-
diate motion representation, and warped the source portrait
with the driving image by the optical flow. FOMM [ 11]
performed first-order Taylor expansion near each keypoint
and approximated the motion in the neighborhood of each
keypoint using local affine transformations. MRAA [ 15]
represented articulated motion with PCA-based motion esti-
mation. Face vid2vid [ 5] extended FOMM by introducing
3D implicit keypoints representation and achieved free-view
portrait animation. IWA [ 10] improved the warping mecha-
nism based on cross-modal attention, which can be extended
to using multiple source images. To estimate the optical
flow more flexibly and work better for large-scale motions,
TPSM [ 7] used nonlinear thin-plate spline transformation
for representing more complex motions. Simultaneously,
DaGAN [ 6] leveraged the dense depth maps to estimate im-
plicit keypoints that capture the critical driving movements.
MCNet [ 8] designed an identity representation conditioned
memory compensation network to tackle the ambiguous gen-
eration caused by the complex driving motions.
Several works [ 18–20] employed predefined motion rep-
resentations, such as 3DMM blendshapes [ 21]. Another line
of works [ 22,23] proposed to learn the latent expression
representation from scratch. MegaPortrait [ 22] used the high-
resolution images beyond the medium-resolution training
images to upgrade animated resolution to megapixel. EMO-
Portraits [ 23] employed an expression-riched training video
dataset and the expression-enhanced loss to express the in-
tense motions.
2.2. Diffusion-based Portrait Animation
Diffusion models [ 2–4] synthesized the desired data samples
from Gaussian noise via removing noises iteratively. [ 2] pro-
posed the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and transferred
the training and inference processes to a compressed latent
space for efficient computing. LDMs have been broadly
applied to many concurrent works in full-body dance gener-
ation [ 24–28], audio-driven portrait animation [ 12,29–34],
and video-driven portrait animation [9, 12, 13, 16].
FADM [ 9] was the first diffusion-based portrait anima-
tion method. It obtained the coarsely animated result via the
pretrained implicit-keypoints-based model and then got the
final animation under the guidance of the 3DMMs with the
diffusion model. Face Adapter [ 16] used an identity adapter
to enhance the identity preservation of the source portrait and
a spatial condition generator to generate the explicit spatial
condition, i.e., keypoints and foreground masks, as the inter-
mediate motion representation. Several works [ 12,13,17]
employed the mutual self-attention and plugged tempo-
ral attention architecture similar to AnimateAnyone [ 24]
to achieve better image quality and appearance preserva-

tion. AniPortrait [ 12] used the explicit spatial condition,
i.e., keypoints, as the intermediate motion representation.
X-Portrait [ 13] proposed to animate the portraits directly
with the original driving video instead of using the inter-
mediate motion representations. It employed the implicit-
keypoint-based method [ 5] for cross-identity training to
achieve this. MegActor [ 17] also animated the source portrait
with the original driving video. It employed the existing face-
swapping and stylization framework to get the cross-identity
training pairs and encoded the background appearance to
improve the animation stability.
3. Methodology
This section details our method. We begin with a brief
review of the video-based portrait animation framework
face vid2vid [ 5] and introduce our significant enhancements
aimed at enhancing the generalization ability and expres-
siveness of animation. Then, we present our meticulously
designed stitching and retargeting modules which provide de-
sired controllability with negligible computational overhead.
Finally, we detail the inference pipeline.
3.1. Preliminary of Face Vid2vid
Face vid2vid [ 5] is a seminal framework for animating a still
portrait, using the motion features extracted from the driving
video sequence. The original framework consists of an ap-
pearance feature extractor F, a canonical implicit keypoint
detector L, a head pose estimation network H, an expression
deformation estimation network ∆, a warping field estimator
W, and a generator G.Fmaps the source image sto a 3D
appearance feature volume fs. The source 3D keypoints xs
and the driving 3D keypoints xdare transformed as follows:
xs=xc,sRs+δs+ts,
xd=xc,sRd+δd+td,(1)where xsandxdare the source and driving 3D implicit
keypoints, respectively, and xc,s∈RK×3represents the
canonical keypoints of the source image. The source and
driving poses are RsandRd∈R3×3, the expression de-
formations are δsandδd∈RK×3, and the translations are
tsandtd∈R3. Next, Wgenerates a warping field using
the implicit keypoint representations xsandxd, and em-
ploys this flow field to warp the source feature volume fs.
Subsequently, the warped features pass through a decoder
generator G, translating them into image space and resulting
in a target image.
3.2. Stage I: Base Model Training
We choose face vid2vid [ 5] as our base model and intro-
duce a series of significant enhancements. These include
high-quality data curation, a mixed image and video training
strategy, an upgraded network architecture, scalable mo-
tion transformation, landmark-guided implicit keypoints op-
timization, and cascaded loss terms. These advancements
significantly enhance the expressiveness of the animation
and the generalization ability of the model. The pipeline of
the first training stage is shown in Fig. 2.
High quality data curation. We leverage public video
datasets such as V oxceleb [ 35], MEAD [ 36], and
RA VDESS [ 37], as well as the styled image dataset
AAHQ [ 38]. Additionally, we collect a large corpus of 4K-
resolution portrait videos with various poses and expressions,
200 hours of talking head videos, and utilize the private
LightStage [ 39,40] dataset, along with several styled por-
trait videos and images. We split long videos into clips of
less than 30 seconds and ensure each clip contains only one
person using face tracking and recognition. To maintain the
quality of the training data, we use KVQ [ 41] to filter out
low-quality video clips. Finally, our training data consists of

The system uses a combination of two key techniques: Stitching : The system can stitch together different facial expressions and movements from the input video to create a smooth, seamless animation. This helps avoid any jarring transitions or glitches in the final animation.

This level of control is useful for applications like virtual avatars or video production. The core innovations in this paper are the novel stitching algorithm and the retargeting control capabilities. These allow the LivePortrait system to generate high-quality, customizable portrait animations efficiently from simple input videos."

sive two-dimensional grids, flexible layouts,
and varied formatting options, which pose sig-
nificant challenges for large language models
(LLMs). In response, we introduce SPREAD -
SHEET LLM , pioneering an efficient encod-
ing method designed to unleash and optimize
LLMs’ powerful understanding and reasoning
capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we pro-
pose a vanilla serialization approach that in-
corporates cell addresses, values, and formats.
However, this approach was limited by LLMs’
token constraints, making it impractical for
most applications. To tackle this challenge, we
develop SHEET COMPRESSOR , an innovative
encoding framework that compresses spread-
sheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises
three modules: structural-anchor-based com-
pression, inverse index translation, and data-
format-aware aggregation. It significantly im-
proves performance in the spreadsheet table
detection task, outperforming the vanilla ap-
proach by 25.6% in GPT4’s in-context learn-
ing setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with
SHEET COMPRESSOR has an average compres-
sion ratio of 25 ×, and achieves a state-of-the-art
78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing
models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain
of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spread-
sheet understanding and validate it in a new and
demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodi-
cally leverage the inherent layout and structure
of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SPREAD -
SHEET LLM is highly effective across a variety
of spreadsheet tasks.

ing spreadsheet layout and structure (Dong et al.,
2019b; Gol et al., 2019; Hulsebos et al., 2019; Dou
et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2022;
Chen and Cafarella, 2014), a longstanding chal-
lenge for traditional models, is crucial for effective
data analysis and intelligent user interaction. Re-
cently, the rapid development of Large Language
Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in table
processing (Li et al., 2023b) and reasoning (Cheng
et al., 2022). However, spreadsheets pose unique
challenges for LLMs due to their expansive grids
that usually exceed the token limitations of popular
LLMs, as well as their inherent two-dimensional
layouts and structures, which are poorly suited to
linear and sequential input. Furthermore, LLMs of-
ten struggle with spreadsheet-specific features such
as cell addresses and formats, complicating their
ability to effectively parse and utilize spreadsheet
data, as detailed in Appendix A.
In this paper, we introduce SPREADSHEET LLM ,
a pioneering framework to unleash and maximize
the potential of LLMs for spreadsheet understand-
ing and reasoning. We initially propose a vanilla
encoding method to serialize spreadsheets into
sequences, augmenting the Markdown encoding
method by including essential cell addresses and
(optional) formats. Furthermore, large spreadsheets
that exceed the token limits of LLMs not only limitarXiv:2407.09025v2 [cs.AI] 2 Apr 2025
their processing but also, as observed in prior stud-
ies, degrade accuracy performance as the size in-
creases (Liu et al., 2024). To address this chal-
lenge, we propose SHEET COMPRESSOR , featur-
ing a novel encoding framework comprising three
portable modules:
1) Structural Anchors for Efficient Layout
Understanding: Observations indicate that large
spreadsheets often contain numerous homogeneous
rows or columns, which contribute minimally to un-
derstanding the layout and structure (see left panel
in Figure 2 (a)). To address this, we identify struc-
tural anchors—heterogeneous rows and columns at
possible table boundaries that offer substantial lay-
out insights, as depicted in Figure 2 (b). Then we
remove distant, homogeneous rows and columns,
producing a condensed ""skeleton"" version of the
spreadsheet, as illustrated in Figure 2 (c).
2) Inverted-Index Translation for Token Ef-
ficiency: The vanilla encoding method becomes
token-consuming when handling spreadsheets with
numerous empty cells and repetitive values, as
shown in Figure 2 (c). To improve efficiency, we
depart from traditional row-by-row and column-by-
column serialization and employ a lossless inverted-
index translation in JSON format. This method cre-
ates a dictionary that indexes non-empty cell texts
and merges addresses with identical text, optimiz-
ing token usage while preserving data integrity.
3) Data Format Aggregation for Numerical
Cells: Adjacent numerical cells often share similar
number formats. Recognizing that exact numeri-
cal values are less crucial for grasping spreadsheet
structure, we extract number format strings and
data types from these cells. Then adjacent cells
with the same formats or types are clustered to-
gether. This method is visualized in the right exam-
ple of Figure 2, where rectangular regions are rep-
resented by uniform format strings and data types,
streamlining the understanding of numerical data
distribution without excessive token expenditure.
We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our
method on a variety of LLMs. Our experiments
show that SHEET COMPRESSOR significantly re-
duces token usage for spreadsheet encoding by
96%. Moreover, SPREADSHEET LLM has shown
exceptional performance in spreadsheet table de-
tection, the foundational task of spreadsheet under-
standing, surpassing the previous SOTA method
by 12.3% (Dong et al., 2019b). We also applied
SPREADSHEET LLM to a representative spread-
sheet QA task. Inspired by the Chain of Thought(CoT) methodology (Zheng et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,
2023b), we propose Chain of Spreadsheet (CoS)
to decompose spreadsheet reasoning into a table
detection-match-reasoning pipeline. It significantly
outperformed existing SOTA methods for table
QA (Liu et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022). Our
primary contributions are summarized as follows:
•We propose SPREADSHEET LLM , the first
work that substantially leverage LLMs for un-
derstanding and analyzing spreadsheet data.
To address challenges in scale, diversity,
and complexity of spreadsheets, we propose
SHEET COMPRESSOR , an innovative encod-
ing framework to compress spreadsheets for
LLMs with efficient encoding.
•We fine-tune a variety of cutting-edge LLMs
to achieve optimal performance on spread-
sheet table detection and demonstrate the high
effectiveness of SPREADSHEET LLM in ac-
curately understanding complex spreadsheet
layouts and structures.
•In order to extend the horizontal capabilities
ofSPREADSHEET LLM to a wide range of
downstream tasks, we propose CoS and verify
it on Spreadsheet QA, highlighting its poten-
tial for intelligent user interaction.

Spreadsheet Representation Spreadsheet repre-
sentation involves converting the spreadsheets into
specific representations for different models. There
are various methods for spreadsheet (table) repre-
sentation. (Dong et al., 2019a,b) enhance Mask-
RCNN to leverage spatial and visual information
in spreadsheets, and (Deng et al., 2024) explores
the usage of LLMs to evaluate image tables, but it
doesn’t work well for spreadsheet images as input
to VLMs (Xia et al., 2024). To capture sequential
semantics in rows and columns, LSTMs are further
adopted (Nishida et al., 2017; Gol et al., 2019) in
row&column directions. Pre-trained LMs (Dong
et al., 2022) are then proposed to understand spread-
sheets (Wang et al., 2021). Recent studies (Zhang
et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Sui et al., 2023) have
explored the efficacy of using Markdown, HTML,
JSON, and DFLoader for table representation, and
these methods are comprehensively summarized in
a recent tutorial of (Dong and Wang, 2024). How-
ever, traditional table representations are not well
suited to spreadsheets due to their assumption of
Figure 2: Illustration of the SHEET COMPRESSOR framework. The original spreadsheet contains two tables, featuring
numerous data entries or hierarchical headers. The completed spreadsheet consists of 576 rows and 23 columns,
with a vanilla encoding of 61,240 tokens. Initially, we first extract cells using structural anchors, rearranging them
into a smaller 24 ×8 sheet. Subsequently, we perform index-invert, removing empty cells. Finally, we aggregate cells
based on data formats, achieving an extremely compact representation of the spreadsheet with only 708 tokens.
single table input and absence of explicit cell ad-
dresses, as experiments show in Appendix B.
Spreadsheet Understanding While most table
LLMs are restricted to single table settings, spread-
sheets with multiple tables typically exceed token
limits. Moreover, the diversity in multi-table layout
and structure significantly confounds the problem.
Spreadsheet table detection (Dong et al., 2019b;
Christodoulakis et al., 2020; Doush and Pontelli,
2010; Vitagliano et al., 2022) aims at identifying
all tables on a given sheet and determining their re-
spective ranges. As a fundamental task for spread-
sheet understanding, this task triggers hundreds
of millions of daily average usage in commercial
spreadsheet tools (Zhang et al., 2024), and the accu-
racy still urges improvements due to the flexibility
and complexity of spreadsheets.
Spreadsheet Downstream Tasks Spreadsheet
understanding is enabling for a series of spread-
sheet tasks, such as table question answering analy-
sis (He et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2021b, 2022; Jiang
et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022), table extraction (Chen
and Cafarella, 2013, 2014; Li et al., 2024), formula
or code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Cheng et al.,
2021a; Joshi et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2023a), error detection (Wang and He, 2019; Dou
et al., 2016), etc. In this paper, we choose spread-
sheet QA, one of the most demanded spreadsheet
analysis tasks. It is an extension of the Table QA
task in spreadsheet data, with the additional com-plexity of detecting and matching multiple tables
within a spreadsheet.
LLMs’ Token Efficiency Related work suggests
that the performance of LLMs degrades signifi-
cantly with long contexts (Liu et al., 2024; Xu
et al., 2023). Efforts to improve model performance
and reduce costs have led to the development of
compression techniques for long prompts. Some
researchers employ information-theory metrics to
filter out redundant information (Li, 2023; Jiang
et al., 2023a). Additionally, specialized models
have been proposed to optimize prompt compres-
sion (Pan et al., 2024). However, these strategies
primarily address natural language prompts and
may not suit tabular data, potentially leading to
considerable structure and data information loss.
DBCopilot (Wang et al., 2023) enables text-to-SQL
conversion on large databases through schema rout-
ing. However, due to LLMs’ insufficient ability to
understand inherent multi-table layouts and com-
plex table structures that cannot execute queries
similar to SQL, schema routing is impractical, re-
stricting the broader application of cutting-edge
tabular works (Cheng et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b;
Sui et al., 2024) on spreadsheet data.
3 Method
We propose a novel spreadsheet encoding frame-
work in a Markdown-like style as text. To achieve
a more compact and efficient representation, we
introduce three independent yet combinable mod-
ules: structural-anchor-based extraction, inverted-
index translation, and data-format-aware aggrega-
tion, which enable efficient data compression and
enhance performance on downstream tasks.
3.1 Vanilla Spreadsheet Encoding with Cell
Value, Address, and Format
Due to the absence of standardized practices in
spreadsheet encoding for LLMs, we first explore
traditional spreadsheet encoding methods. Ap-
pendix B presents a comparison of different main-
stream tabular data encoding methods, including
HTML, XML, and Markdown. Based on the en-
coding length and performance on spreadsheet un-
derstanding tasks, we use a Markdown-like style
representation:
S={Cell i,j}i∈m,j∈n, (1)
T= markdown {encode ( Cell i,j)}
: = “|Address i,j, Value i,j, Format |...\n”,
(2)
where S ∈Rm,ndenotes the spreadsheet, T ∈R1
denotes the text representation of a cell, and i,j,
m,nrespectively represent the row and column in-
dex of the cell and the row and column range of S.
We also explored the inclusion of cell format infor-
mation (such as background color, bold font, bor-
ders, etc.) into each cell’s representation. However,
these experiments demonstrated that such detailed
encoding adversely affects model performance due
to rapid token limit exceedance and LLMs’ inad-
equate capability to process format information
effectively, as detailed in Appendix A. We plan to
further explore this in future research, focusing on
enhancing the model’s ability to understand and
utilize format and structural cues.
3.2 Structural-anchor-based Extraction
Large spreadsheets often feature numerous homo-
geneous rows or columns, which minimally con-
tribute to the understanding of their layout and
structure, as depicted in Figure 2 (a). To effec-
tively compress spreadsheets while preserving vital
layout and structural information, we propose a
novel heuristic-based method, detailed further in
Appendix C. This method identifies heterogeneous
rows and columns at the edges of table bound-
aries—termed structural anchors:
A={rp, cq}p∈m,q∈n, (3)where rp={Celli,j}i=p,j∈nandcq={Celli,j}i∈m,j=q.
Using these anchor points, our method discards
rows and columns that are located more than kcells
away from any anchor point, because they rarely
serve as table boundaries. The parameter kserves
as a threshold to control the scope of neighborhood
retention, effectively eliminating areas predomi-
nantly filled with homogeneous data that do not
contribute to an understanding of the spreadsheet’s
layout and structure. We explored the effects of
different kvalues in an ablation study, as detailed
in Appendix D.1.
The extracted rows and columns can be ex-
pressed as:
A+=
rp+, cq+	
p+∈m,q +∈n, (4)
where the extracted ""skeletons"" are defined
as:rp+={Cell i,j}|i−p|≤k,j∈nandcq+=
{Cell i,j}i∈m,|j−q|≤k. Then we obtain the extracted
compact spreadsheet:
Se= extract( S) = address _map( rp+∩cq+).
(5)
Based on the compressed spreadsheet Se, we can
obtain extremely shorter text representation Te.
Furthermore, after extraction, we perform a co-
ordinate re-mapping to ensure continuity in cell
coordinates, preserving the integrity of data rela-
tionships within the compressed spreadsheet. This
re-mapping is critical for maintaining the accuracy
of prediction results, ensuring that analyses remain
consistent even after compression. This method fil-
ters out 75% spreadsheet content but preserves 97%
rows and columns at the edges of table boundaries.
3.3 Inverted-index Translation
Spreadsheets often contain numerous empty rows,
columns, and scattered cells. The standard en-
coding method, as detailed in Section 3.1, em-
ploys a grid-based method that pairs cell addresses
with their contents. This approach necessitates
recording empty cells to maintain the spreadsheet’s
two-dimensional structure, which significantly in-
creases token consumption. Furthermore, cells
with identical values are encoded repeatedly, exac-
erbating token usage.
To address these inefficiencies, we propose
a two-stage Inverted-index-based Translation
method. The first stage involves converting the
traditional matrix-style encoding into a dictionary
format, where cell values serve as keys indexing
the addresses. In the second stage, cells sharing the
same value are merged, with empty cells excluded
and cell addresses noted as ranges. This method
effectively reduces the number of required tokens
by eliminating redundancies and simplifying the
representation of repeated and empty cells. The
translation process is represented mathematically
as follows:
Tt= invert( T)
: = {Value :Address or Address _Region, ... }.(6)
Inverted-index Translation is a lossless compres-
sion method general for all spreadsheet understand-
ing tasks, and it remarkably increases SHEET COM-
PRESSOR ’s compression ratio from 4.41 to 14.91.
More details can be found in Table 1.
3.4 Data-format-aware Aggregation
In spreadsheets, adjacent cells typically share the
same data format. As shown in Figure 2 (3), col-
umn C records the sell-in billed revenue for differ-
ent products. Nonetheless, the concrete numerical
values are not essential for understanding the struc-
ture and semantics of the spreadsheet (although
there might be a loss of fine-trained details of exact
quantities, e.g., ""18,476"" and ""18,674"", this does
not impact our comprehension that this column
represents revenue). In contrast, the data type is
critical for understanding spreadsheets. On one
hand, data types represent fundamental semantic
properties, such as ""time"" or ""phone number"". It
motivates us to implement rules to match the value
of the cell to different data types. On the other hand,
in contrast to detailed numerical values, identical
data types may be compressed through clustering,
thereby reducing the number of tokens.
In this section, we introduce Data-format-aware
Aggregation for further compression and informa-
tion integration. Specifically, we employ Number
Format String (NFS), which is a built-in cell at-
tribute in spreadsheets. NFSs can be extracted by
default using tools like ClosedXML or OpenPyXL,
used to describe the format of cell data as a string.
For instance, the NFS for ""2024.2.14"" is ""yyyy-
mm-dd"", indicating a specific date format. How-
ever, spreadsheet users do not always explicitly add
NFSs to cells, so NFSs are sometimes absent. As a
complement, we propose a rule-based recognizer to
map a cell value to a specific predefined data type:
Year, Integer, Float, Percentage, Scientific notation,
Date, Time, Currency, Email, and Others. The first
nine types broadly cover approximately 55% of thecells in our dataset derived from real-world corpora.
Finally, based on the NFSs and data type, the ag-
gregator aggregates the cells by Algorithm 1. This
process can be represented as follows:
NFSs = nfs( {Cell i,j}i∈m,j∈n), (7)
Ta= aggregator( {Cell i,j}i∈m,j∈n, NFSs, R ),
(8)
where Rdenotes the predefined rules as detailed
above. In this way, we further reduce the number
of tokens. The compression ratio of the data re-
gions also increases from 14.91 to 24.79. More
detailed compression effects of different modules
are displayed in Table 1.
3.5 Chain of Spreadsheet
To extend the applicability of SPREADSHEET LLM
to a broader range of downstream tasks, we in-
troduce the Chain of Spreadsheet (CoS), which
unfolds two stages:
Table Identification and Boundary Detection
Initially, the compressed spreadsheet and the spe-
cific task query are input into the LLM. Leveraging
the advances in spreadsheet table detection, the
model identifies the table that is relevant to the
query and determines the precise boundaries of the
relevant content. This step ensures that only perti-
nent data is considered in the subsequent analysis,
optimizing the processing efficiency and focus.
Response Generation The query and the iden-
tified table section are re-inputted detected tables
into the LLM. The model then processes this in-
formation to generate an accurate response to the
query.
Through the CoS, SPREADSHEET LLM effec-
tively handles complex spreadsheets by breaking
down the process into manageable parts, thus en-
abling precise and context-aware responses. In this
paper, we validate the effect of the Spreadsheet QA
task, which is detailed in Section 4.2.
4 Experiments
In our experimental evaluation, we first verified the
effectiveness of our method in spreadsheet under-
standing. For this purpose, we chose the classic
and foundational task of spreadsheet table detec-
tion (Dong et al., 2019b). This task serves as a
critical benchmark for assessing the framework’s
ability to accurately identify and interpret table
structures within spreadsheets. Building upon this
foundational understanding, we further explored
the applicability of our method to downstream ap-
plications by selecting the representative task of
spreadsheet QA. This allows us to test the model’s
capability to not only detect but also comprehend
and respond to user queries based on the data and
structure identified in the spreadsheets.
4.1 Spreadsheet Table Detection
4.1.1 Dataset
We used the dataset introduced by (Dong et al.,
2019b), a benchmark dataset of real-world spread-
sheets with annotated table boundaries. Due to
the complexity and ambiguity of precise address
labeling (the Fleiss Kappa on the test set is 0.830),
we further implemented the quality improvement
pipeline on the test set by five human professionals,
as detailed n in Appendix E. To this end, we ob-
tained a highly validated test set containing 188
spreadsheets. Based on the token usage of the
vanilla encoding method, we divided the test set
into four categories: Small, Medium, Large, and
Huge, with a partition of 64:32:70:22. More details
are shown in Appendix F. We adopted the Error-
of-Boundary 0 (EoB-0) metric for evaluation on
188 spreadsheets with 311 tables. EoB-0 requires
exact match of the top, left, bottom, and right
boundaries.
4.1.2 Experiment Setup
Baseline & Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the
performance of SPREADSHEET LLM , we chose
TableSense-CNN (Dong et al., 2019b) as the base-
line due to its previously demonstrated effective-
ness in the spreadsheet table detection task. We
employed the micro F1 Score as the primary metric
to evaluate and compare the performance of dif-
ferent models, as it balances precision and recall,
providing a holistic view of model accuracy.
Model Selection The experiments included both
closed-source and open-source models. From the
closed-source spectrum, we selected two versions
of OpenAI’s models: GPT4 and GPT3.5, which are
known for their advanced language understanding
capabilities. On the open-source side, we chose
Llama2, Llama3, Phi3, and Mistral-v2. The spe-
cific configurations are detailed in Appendix G.
4.2 Spreadsheet QA
4.2.1 Dataset
Existing datasets for the Table QA task focus solely
on single-table scenarios, leaving a notable gap inperformance evaluation for spreadsheets that con-
tain multiple tables. To bridge this gap, we de-
veloped a new Spreadsheet QA dataset tailored
to the complexities of multi-table environments.
We sampled 64 spreadsheets from our larger col-
lection and crafted 4-6 questions per spreadsheet,
targeting fundamental operations such as searching,
comparison, and basic arithmetic. We deliberately
excluded questions involving composite operations
to maintain clarity and focus in testing specific
skills. Each question was paired with an answer,
formatted either as a specific cell address or a for-
mula that includes cell addresses, facilitating direct
and unambiguous evaluations of the model’s abil-
ity to navigate and interpret spreadsheet data. This
approach resulted in a comprehensive test dataset
comprising 307 items, each a tuple of (Q, A, S ),
which is detailed in Appendix H.
4.2.2 Experiment Setup
Baseline & Evaluation Metrics Given that
LLMs have not yet been systematically applied
to Spreadsheet QA tasks, we have selected TAPEX
and Binder (Liu et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022),
which are established baselines in the Table QA
domain, for comparative evaluation. Since TAPEX
and Binder are designed primarily for single-table
data, we adapted them for our multi-table context.
Initially, our fine-tuned model identifies table re-
gions relevant to each question. These regions are
then formatted and fed into the baseline models. In
cases where the input exceeds the token limitations
of the baseline models, truncation is employed. The
accuracy of the answers is assessed based on the
correctness of the cell addresses and cell combina-
tions/calculations provided in the answers.
Model Selection Our experiments were con-
ducted using the GPT4 model, leveraging its ad-
vanced capabilities in language understanding and
reasoning. Details on parameters and configura-
tions used are documented in Appendix G.
4.2.3 Experiment Procedure
In this section, we employed the model fine-tuned
on the spreadsheet table detection task to conduct
QA experiments. In the QA experiments, we uti-
lized the fine-tuned model on the table boundary
detection task for spreadsheet QA as an ablation
to study the generalization capability of the fine-
tuned boundary detection model. CoS supports
multi-step reasoning during the response genera-
tion process. In the QA scenarios, the whole steps

include spreadsheet table detection, table structure
understanding, table splitting, and sub-table QA.
In cases where tables were exceptionally large and
defy effective compression, we utilized a table-
splitting algorithm designed to recognize headers
and perform strategic concatenation, ensuring that
each segment of the split table retains as much con-
textual integrity as possible. The specifics of this
algorithm are detailed in Appendix M.2. We cate-
gorically classify the model’s responses as either
correct or incorrect, and we select accuracy as the
evaluation metric.
5 Results
5.1 Compression Ratio
The effectiveness of our encoding process in reduc-
ing the size of spreadsheet data is quantitatively
assessed using the compression ratio, which is de-
fined by the formula:
r=n/n′, (9)
Our encoding methodology has significantly opti-
mized token usage within spreadsheets. In our test
set, it achieved an impressive 25 ×compression ra-
tio, substantially reducing the computational load
for processing large datasets. The specific compres-
sion ratios achieved by various module combina-
tions within SHEET COMPRESSOR are detailed in
Table 1. These results highlight the efficacy of our
approach across different configurations, demon-
strating its robustness and adaptability in handling
diverse spreadsheet structures.

4) Significant Cost Reduction: Our cost was

This paper introduces a new way to represent spreadsheets that makes it easier for LLMs to work with them. The key idea is to encode the structure, formulas, and data in spreadsheets in a format that LLMs can process more effectively. For example, the researchers represent the relationships between cells and the logic encoded in formulas in a way that preserves the spreadsheet's semantics. This allows LLMs to better understand and reason about the contents of a spreadsheet. By using this SpreadsheetLLM approach, the researchers show that LLMs can perform tasks like predicting missing cell values or generating new formulas more accurately than previous methods. This could be useful for applications like spreadsheet automation, where an LLM could assist users by suggesting relevant formulas or completing partially filled-in spreadsheets."

5.7 Case Study
As illustrated in Figure 7, we conduct a case study
comparing DeepRAG with Auto-RAG (Yu et al.,
2024), a closely related method that utilizes iter-
ative retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation.
For each subquery, Auto-RAG retrieves relevant
documents and generates a corresponding suban-
swer. This approach is not only time-consuming
but also fails when no relevant documents are re-
trieved. Although Auto-RAG attempts to addressthis issue using its own relevant documents, it
falls into endless loops in most cases. In con-
trast, DeepRAG iteratively generates subqueries
and determines whether to use internal knowledge
at each iteration. The binary tree search data syn-
thesis method for optimization ensures reliable sub-
query generation, intermediate answers, and final
answers. Even when no related information exists
in retrieved documents, the model is directed to pro-
vide a final answer based on internal knowledge.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we present DeepRAG, a simple yet ef-
fective approach that enhances LLM’s awareness of
retrieval requirements through self-calibration. Our
method decomposes queries into subqueries and
uses binary tree search for data synthesis to help
models better understand their knowledge bound-
aries. Experimental results across various QA tasks
demonstrate that DeepRAG significantly improves
the accuracy and efficiency of retrieval-augmented
generation.

B Detailed Analysis
B.1 Retrieval Efficiency
To demonstrate the efficiency of our method, we
compare the average number of retrievals on 2Wiki-
MultihopQA and WebQuestions. As shown in Ta-
ble 2, We have following observations:
1) Compared to other adaptive retrieval meth-
ods, DeepRAG can achieve higher accuracy with
relatively lower retrieval costs. This can be at-
tributed to our dynamic usage of internal knowl-
edge. Additionally, DeepRAG exhibits a posi-
tive trend in exploring relevant evidence when
faced with insufficient retrieval results, as evi-
denced by the lower average retrieval numbers in
both 2WMQA (0.92 compared to 1.25) and WQ
11
(0.12 compared to 0.36). 2) Confidence-based ap-
proaches demonstrate limited robustness across
datasets. For instance, while using identical thresh-
olds, both FLARE and DRAGIN methods show
inconsistent behavior: they trigger approximately
one retrieval per query in 2WMQA, but fail to reach
the retrieval threshold entirely in WQ. This incon-
sistency highlights the challenge of maintaining
reliable performance across different datasets using
confidence-based methods. 3) Iterative retrieval-
based approaches typically require numerous re-
trieval operations, resulting in substantial computa-
tional costs. Therefore, efficient adaptive retrieval
methods like DeepRAG become crucial for opti-
mizing resource utilization while maintaining per-
formance.
B.2 Relevance to Parametric Knowledge
In this section, we investigate the relationship be-
tween retrieval needs and parametric knowledge to
demonstrate how effectively our method explores
the knowledge boundary.
Ideally, models should initiate retrieval for
queries beyond their parametric knowledge while
utilizing their existing knowledge for familiar
queries. We use CoT results as an indicator of
whether the model can answer questions using
its parametric knowledge. Subsequently, we ana-
lyze whether other adaptive retrieval methods align
with this pattern of parametric knowledge utiliza-
tion. We evaluate the relevance using four met-
rics. F1 score and Accuracy serve as basic per-
formance measures, while balanced accuracy and
Matthews Correlation Coefficient(MCC) are em-
ployed to account for the class imbalance between
retrieval-required and retrieval-not-required cases.
The MCC ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1
indicates perfect correlation, 0 represents no corre-
lation (random chance), and -1 signifies an inverse
correlation.
As shown in Table 3, we find that 1) Deep-
RAG demonstrates superior relevance performance
across F1, balanced accuracy, and MCC metrics.
This suggests that DeepRAG successfully identifies
retrieval necessity by exploring knowledge bound-
ary. 2) While FLARE, DRAGIN, and TAARE
exhibit high accuracy scores, their relatively low
balanced accuracy and MCC scores suggest they
mainly succeed in retrieval-required cases but strug-
gle to properly avoid unnecessary retrievals.B.3 Ablation Study

12","DeepRAG works like a careful student who plans their research before diving into books. Instead of immediately searching for information, it first thinks about what it needs to know and breaks down complex questions into smaller parts. This methodical approach helps avoid common mistakes that happen when searching too broadly or jumping to conclusions. For example, when asked about historical events, DeepRAG first considers what specific details it needs to verify, then searches for those exact pieces of information. The system uses a two-stage process . First, it develops a reasoning plan, then retrieves information to support each step of that plan. This is similar to how a detective might solve a case - first outlining the key questions, then gathering evidence for each point."
52,AI and the Problem of Knowledge Collapse,"AI and the Problem of Knowledge Collapse
Andrew J. Peterson
April 2024
While artificial intelligence has the potential to process vast amounts of data, generate new insights,
and unlock greater productivity, its widespread adoption may entail unforeseen consequences. We
identify conditions under which AI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge,
can paradoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are trained on vast
amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards the ‘center’ of the distribution.
This is generally useful, but widespread reliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we
define as “knowledge collapse”, and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of human
understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose what data they are
trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to
be worthwhile. To investigate this, we provide a simple model in which a community of learners or
innovators choose to use traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and
identify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default model, a 20% discount
on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3 times further from the truth than when there
is no discount. An empirical approach to measuring the distribution of LLM outputs is provided in
theoretical terms and illustrated through a specific example comparing the diversity of outputs
across different models and prompting styles. Finally, we consider further research directions to
counteract harmful outcomes.

1. Introduction
Before the advent of generative AI, all text and artwork was produced by humans, in some cases
aided by tools or computer systems. The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate
text with near-zero human effort, however, along with models to generate images, audio, and video,
suggest that the data to which humans are exposed may come to be dominated by AI-generated or
AI-aided processes.
Researchers have noted that the recursive training of AI models on synthetic text may lead to
degeneration, known as “model collapse” (Shumailov et al .2023). Our interest is in the inverse
of this concern, focusing instead on the equilibrium effects on the distribution of knowledge
within human society. We ask under what conditions the rise of AI-generated content and AI-
mediated access to information might harm the future of human thought, information-seeking,
and knowledge.
The initial effect of AI-generated information is presumably limited, and existing work on the
harms of AI rightly focuses on the immediate effects of false information spread by “deepfakes”
(Heidari et al .2023), bias in AI algorithms (Nazer et al .2023), and political misinformation (Chen
and Shu 2023). Our focus has a somewhat longer time horizon, and probes the impact of widespread,
rather than marginal adoption.
Researchers and engineers are currently building a variety of systems whereby AI would mediate
our experience with other humans and with information sources. These range from learning from
LLMs (Chen, Chen, and Lin 2020), ranking or summarizing search results with LLMs (Sharma, Liao,
and Xiao 2024), suggesting search terms or words to write as with traditional autocomplete (Graham
2023; Chonka, Diepeveen, and Haile 2023), designing systems to pair collaborators (Ball and Lewis
2018), LLM-based completion of knowledge bases sourced from Wikipedia (Chen, Razniewski, and
Weikum 2023), interpreting government data (Fisher 2024) and aiding journalists (Opdahl et al .
2023), to cite only a few from an ever-growing list.
Over time, dependence on these systems, and the existence of multifaceted interactions among
them, may create a “curse of recursion” (Shumailov et al .2023), in which our access to the original
diversity of human knowledge is increasingly mediated by a partial and increasingly narrow subset
of views. With increasing integration of LLM-based systems, certain popular sources or beliefs
which were common in the training data may come to be reinforced in the public mindset (and
within the training data), while other “long-tail” ideas are neglected and eventually forgotten.
Such a process might be reinforced by an ‘echo chamber’ or information cascade effect, in
which repeated exposure to this restricted set of information leads individuals to believe that
the neglected, unobserved tails of knowledge are of little value. To the extent AI can radically
discount the cost of access to certain kinds of information, it may further generate harm through
the “streetlight effect”, in which a disproportionate amount of search is done under the lighted area
not because it is more likely to contain one’s keys but because it’s easier to look there. We argue
that the resulting curtailment of the tails of human knowledge would have significant effects on
a range of concerns, including fairness, inclusion of diversity, lost-gains in innovation, and the
preservation of the heritage of human culture.
In our simulation model, however, we also consider the possibility that humans are strategic
in actively curating their information sources. If, as we argue, there is significant value in the tai’
areas of knowledge that come to be neglected by AI-generated content, some individuals may put
in additional effort to realize the gains, assuming they are sufficiently informed about the potential
value.
1.1. Summary of Main Contributions
We identify a dynamic whereby AI, despite only reducing the cost of access to certain kinds
of information, may lead to “knowledge collapse,” neglecting the long-tails of knowledge and
creating an degenerately narrow perspective over generations. We provide a positive knowledge
spillovers model with in which individuals decide whether to rely on cheaper AI technology or
invest in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge. We examine through simulations
the conditions under which individuals are sufficiently informed to prevent knowledge collapse
within society. To evaluate this empirically, we outline an approach to defining and measuring
output diversity, and provide an illustrative example. Finally, we conclude with an overview of
possible solutions to prevent knowledge collapse in the AI-era.
2. Previous Work
Technology has long affected how we access knowledge, raising concerns about its impact on
the transmission and creation of knowledge. Yeh Meng-te, for example, argued in the twelfth
century that the rise of books led to a decline in the practice of memorizing and collating texts that
contributed to a decline of scholarship and the repetition of errors (Cherniack 1994). Even earlier, a
discussion in Plato’s Phaedrus considers whether the transition from oral tradition to reading texts
was harmful to memory, reflection and wisdom (Hackforth 1972).
We focus on recent work on the role of digital platforms and social interactions, and mention
only in passing the literature on historical innovations and knowledge (Ong 2013; Mokyr 2011;
Havelock 2019), and the vast literature on the printing press (Dittmar 2011; Eisenstein 1980). Like
other media transitions before it (Wu 2011), the rise of internet search algorithms and of social
media raised concerns about the nature and distribution of information people are exposed to, and
the downstream effects on attitudes and political polarization (Cinelli et al. 2021; Barberá 2020).
The following section considers research on the impact of recommendation algorithms and
self-selection on social media, and how this might generate distorted and polarizing opinions, as an
analogy for understanding the transformation brought about by reliance on AI. We consider game
theoretic models of information cascades as an alternative model for failure in social learning,
in which the public to fails to update rationally on individuals’ private signals. Next, we review
the main findings of network analysis on the flow of information in social media, which also
identify mechanisms which distort knowledge formation. We then examine the specific nature
of generative AI algorithms, focusing on the problem of model collapse and known biases in AI
outputs.
2.1. The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers
A common critique of social media is that they allow users to select in to “echo chambers” (specific
communities or communication practices) in which they are exposed to only a narrow range of
topics or perspectives. For example, instead of consulting the “mainstream” news where a centrist
and relatively balanced perspective is provided, users are exposed to selective content that echoes
pre-existing beliefs. In the ideological version of the echo-chamber hypothesis, individuals within
a latent ideological space (for example a one-dimensional left-right spectrum), are exposed to peers
and content with ideologically-similar views. If so, their beliefs are reinforced socially and by a
generalization from their bounded observations, leading to political polarization (Cinus et al .2022;
Jamieson and Cappella 2008; Pariser 2011).
A simple model for this assumes homophily within in a network growth model, in which similar
individuals chose to interact. Implicitly the approach presumes that this is common on social
media but not common within traditional media, which for technological reasons were constrained
to provide the same content across a broad population with possibly heterogeneous preferences.1
This general dynamic may hold even if traditional media and newspapers were themselves dynamic
systems interacting with their consumers, markets and advertisers, and themselves adapting their
message to specific communities and preferences (Angelucci, Cagé, and Sinkinson forthcoming;
Cagé 2020; Boone, Carroll, and van Witteloostuijn 2002) .
The second main line of analysis focuses on “filter bubbles,” whereby the content to which users
are exposed is selected based on a recommendation system. Jiang, et al., model this as a dynamic
process between a user’s evolving interests and behavior (such as clicking a link, video, or text)
1The reality is as usual more complex. For example, in the post-war era, the concern was almost the inverse- the fear
that the few channels that were possible with television led to ‘homogenization.’ There are also other dynamics at play
than technological constraints. For example, in contrast to TV , the 1950s and 1960s saw a proliferation of more diverse
and local radio stations, some catering to ethnic minorities and musical tastes outside the mainstream. The ‘payola’
scandals, however, led to regulations that shifted content decisions from diverse DJs to centralized music directors
(Douglas 2002).
and a recommender system which aims to maximize expected utility for the user (Jiang et al .2019).
In their reinforcement learning-inspired framework, the aim is for the user to explore the space of
items or topics without the algorithm assigning degenerate (extremely high or zero) probabilities
to these items. As above, a key concern is the political or ideological content of recommendations
their relation to polarization (Keijzer and Mäs 2022). In a more recent twist, (Sharma, Liao, and Xiao
2024) find that LLM-powered search may generate more selective exposure bias and polarization
by reinforcing pre-existing opinions based on finer-grained clues in the user’s queries.
Particularly relevant for our context is the issue of “popularity bias” in recommender systems, in
which a small subset of content receives wide exposure while users (distributed based on some long-
tailed distribution, like the topics) from smaller groups or with rare preferences are marginalized.
On the one hand, users may desire to be exposed to popular content, for example to understand
trending ideas or fashions. But overly favoring popular items can lead to user disengagement
because it neglects their unique interests, lacks variety, etc. (Klug et al .2021) . Recommendation
systems are often biased in the sense that even when a subset of users wants to get access to
non-popular items, they receive few or no such recommendations. A number of approaches have
been suggested to counteract this tendency (Lin et al. 2022; Gao et al. 2023).
The problem of popularity bias is ironic given that one of the unique contributions of the
internet was its ability to provide access to long-tailed products and services that were previously
ignored or inaccessible (Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Smith 2006, 2003). By extension, we would expect
social media and the internet to make possible a more diverse and rich informational environment.
The role of self-selection into communities and recommendation algorithms provides a explanation
for why this might not be the case. In the next section we consider a more general set of models
that examine information flow within networks and the idea of information cascades.
2.2. Network effects and Information Cascades
Information cascade models provide one approach to explaining a kind of herd behavior (where
diverse and free individuals nonetheless make similar decisions). They explore the conditions
under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public. This can occur where
individuals sequentially make decisions from a discrete set after observing the behaviors but not
the private signals of others. This can generate a “herd externality” (Banerjee 1992) in which an
individual ignores her private signal in deciding, and as a result the public is in turn unable to
update on her private information. In the extreme, this can mean that allprivate information, aside
from that of the first few individuals, is completely ignored (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch
1998; Smith and Sørensen 2000). In some variants of the model, individuals must pay to receive a
signal, which encourages the tendency to want to free-ride on the information received by others,
and thus the greater the cost, the more likely it is that a cascade develops.
A related literature on the spread of information on social networks analyzes information
cascades in terms of network structure, as a kind of contagion. Here, the focus is not on private
information but how information flows within the network. For example, independent cascade
models consider how an individual may change their beliefs based on some diffusion probability
as a result of contact with a neighbor with that belief (Goldenberg, Libai, and Muller 2001; Gruhl et
al. 2004).
More generally, such models determine the probability of diffusion within a network as some
function of the connected nodes, and may also incorporate additional characteristics such as
each nodes’ social influence, ideological or other preferences, or topics (Barbieri, Bonchi, and
Manco 2013). Alternatively, epidemic models allow that individuals may be in one of three states -
susceptible, infected (capable of transmitting the information), and recovered (in which case they
have the information but do not consider it worth sharing with others) (Kermack and McKendrick
1927; Barrat, Barthélemy, and Vespignani 2008) .
Social (and even physical) proximity can lead individuals to share similar attitudes, such as when
individuals randomly assigned housing together come to have attitudes similar to their apartment
block and differing from nearby blocks (Festinger, Schachter, and Back 1950; Nowak, Szamrej,
and Latané 1990). Empirically, some claim that weak-ties may be more important for information
diffusion that strong-ties (Bakshy et al .2012), while another approach focuses on clustering within
the network as a means for spreading information (Centola 2010). More sophisticated models
allow for the evolution not only of opinion process but the edges between nodes of the network
(Castellano, Fortunato, and Loreto 2009).
These models suggest specific opinion-formation dynamics based on what other humans, texts,
images, etc. an individual interacts with. By extension, we could consider the generalization of these
networks to the case where LLMs play a key role as (possibly influential) nodes, or as determining
how an individual navigates a knowledge graph. One of the key ideas of Web 2.0 was that users, not
just authors or programmers, structure the knowledge (O’Reilly 2005). By extension, in the AI era,
LLMs interact with users, authors, programmers and technology to structure that knowledge, and
understanding the flow of information requires understanding the emergent behavior of these
elements.
2.3. Model collapse
The idea of model collapse is rooted in the earlier phenomenon of “mode collapse” in generative
adversarial networks (GANs). GANs are based on a generator neural network that proposes, e.g. an
image, and a discriminator attempts to predict whether a given image is created by the generator
or is a real image from the dataset. While ideally the generator attempts to produce images across
the full range of input data, in practice they may settle into producing a narrow range of images
for which it is good at fooling the discriminator, known as mode collapse (Goodfellow 2016; Arora
et al.2017). The case of “posterior collapse” was also identified in modeling language data with
variational autoencoders (Melis, György, and Blunsom 2022).
Shumailov, et al. (2023) introduced the term “model collapse” to describe a related process when
models such as variational autoencoders, Gaussian mixture models, and LLMs are trained on data
produced by an earlier version of the model. Incorporating AI-generated content in the training
data causes loss of information which they categorize into two types. First, in “early model collapse,”
the tails of the distribution are lost due to statistical error (finite sampling bias) or functional
approximation error, which leads to reversion to the mean. Second, “late model collapse” may
occur when a model converges with narrow variance on a distribution unlike the original data.
They provide evidence of such model collapse in LLMs and other models, see for example Figure 1.

On the one hand, under some conditions the injection of true (non AI-generated) data can
preserve representation of the true distribution (Dohmatob et al .2024), though in other models,
small amounts of synthetic data can poison an image model, and once distorted, it is difficult for
such models to recover even after being trained on true data (Bohacek and Farid 2023). As one
particular example, training LLMs on synthetic data can lead to diminishing lexical, semantic and
syntactic diversity (Guo et al. 2023).
2.4. Known biases in LLMs
Newer AI models such as LLMs are not immune to the problems of bias identified and measured in
machine learning algorithms (Nazer et al .2023) and which have plagued predictive algorithms in
real-world uses cases going back to at least the 1930s (Christian 2021). Unsurprisingly, LLMs are
better at recalling facts that occur frequently within the training data and struggle with long-tail
knowledge (Kandpal et al .2023). (Das et al .2024) identify a range of shortcomings of LLMs in
attempting to generate human-like texts, such as under-representing minority viewpoints and
reducing the broad concept of “positive” text to that simply of expressing “joy”.
Recent work attempts to address these issues through a variety of methods, for example by
upsampling under-represented features on which prediction is otherwise sub-optimal (Gesi et
al.2023), or evaluating the importance of input data using shapely values (Karlaš et al .2022).
However, the mechanistic interpretability work on LLMs to date suggest that our understanding,
while improving, is still very limited (Kramár et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2023). As such, direct methods
for overcoming such biases are, at a minimum, not close at hand. Finally, while much of the focus is
naturally on overt racial and gender biases, there may also be pervasive but less observable biases
in the content and form of the output. For example, current LLMs trained on large amounts of
English text may ‘rely on’ English in their latent representations, as if a kind of reference language
(Wendler et al. 2024).
One particular area in which the diversity of LLM outputs has been analyzed is on a token-by-
token level in the context of decoding strategies. In some situations, using beam search to choose
the most likely next token can create degenerate repetitive phrases (Su et al .2022). Furthermore, a
bit like Thelonious Monk’s melodic lines, humans do not string together sequences of the most
likely words but occasionally try to surprise the listener by sampling from low-probability words,
defying conventions, etc. (Holtzman et al. 2020).
3. A Model of Knowledge Collapse
3.1. Defining Knowledge Collapse
A commonly held, optimistic view is that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, and
will continue to do so. This indeed appears to be the case for certain scientific fields like physics,
chemistry, or molecular biology, where we can measure the quality of predictions made over time.
For example, accuracy in the computation of digits of πhas increased from 1 digit in 200 BCE to 16
in 1424 (Jamashid al-Kashi) to 1014digits recently.
In other domains, however, it is less clear, especially within regions. Historically, knowledge
has not progressed monotonically, as evidenced by the fall of the Western Roman empire, the
destruction of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad and subsequent decline of the Abbasid Empire after
1258, or the collapse of the Mayan civilization in the 8th or 9th century. Or, to cite specific examples,
the ancient Romans had a recipe for concrete that was subsequently lost, and despite progress
we have not yet re-discovered the secrets of its durability (Seymour et al .2023), and similarly for
Damascus steel (Kürnsteiner et al .2020). Culturally, there are many languages, cultural and artistic
practices, and religious beliefs that were once held by communities of humans which are now lost
in that they do not exist among any known sources (Nettle and Romaine 2000).
The distribution of knowledge across individuals also varies over time. For example, traditional
hunter-gatherers could identify thousands of different plants and knew their medicinal usages,
whereas most humans today only know a few dozen plants and whether they can be purchased
in a grocery store. This could be seen as a more efficient form of specialization of information
across individuals, but it might also impact our beliefs about the value of those species or of a walk
through a forest, or influence scientific or policy-relevant judgements.
Informally,2we define knowledge collapse as the progressive narrowing over time (or over
technological representations) of the set of information available to humans, along with a con-
comitant narrowing in the perceived availability and utility of different sets of information. The
latter is important because for many purposes it is not sufficient for their to exist a capability to, for
example, go to an archive to look up some information. If all members deem it too costly or not
worthwhile to seek out some information, that theoretically available information is neglected and
useless.
3.2. Model Overview
The main focus of the model is whether individuals decide to invest in innovation or learning
(we treat these as interchangeable) in the ‘traditional’ way, through a possibly cheaper AI-enabled
process, or not at all. The idea is to capture, for example, the difference between someone who
does extensive research in an archive rather than just relying on readily-available materials, or
someone who takes the time to read a full book rather than reading a two-paragraph LLM-generated
summary.
Humans, unlike LLMs trained by researchers, have agency in deciding among possible inputs.
Thus, a key dynamic of the model is to allow for the possibility that rational agents may be able to
prevent or to correct for distortion from over-dependence on ‘centrist’ information. If past samples
neglect the ‘tail’ regions, the returns from such knowledge should be relatively higher. To the extent
that they observe this, individuals would be willing to pay more (put in more labor) to profit from
these additional gains. We thus investigate under what conditions such updating among individuals
is sufficient to preserve an accurate vision of the truth for the community as a whole.
2For further discussion and a more precise definition using the notation from the model, see the Appendix.
The cost-benefit decision to invest in new information depends on the expected value of that
information. Anyone who experiments with AI for, e.g. text summarization, develops an intuitive
sense of when the AI provides the main idea sufficiently well for a given purpose and when it is
worth going straight to the source. We assume that individuals cannot foresee the future, but they
do observe in common the realized rewards from previous rounds. The decision also depends on
each individual’s type. Specifically, nindividuals have types Θndrawn from a lognormal distribution
withµ=1,σ=0.5. Depending on how their utility is calculated (not a substantive focus here), these
could be interpreted as different expected returns from innovation ( e.g.techno-optimists versus
pessimists), or their relative ability or desire to engage in innovation.

(i.e. how far they move the public pdf towards the true pdf)
determines the n’s payout when multiplied by Θn
We model knowledge as a process of approximating a (Students t) probability distribution.3
This is simply a metaphor, although it has parallels for example in the analysis of model collapse
(Shumailov et al .2023), but we make no claim that “truth” is in some deep way distributed 1-D
Gaussian. This is a modeling assumption in order to work with a process with well-known properties,
where there is both a large central mass and long-tails, which we take to be in some general way
reflective of the nature of knowledge (and of the distribution of training data for LLMs.)
The set of individuals who decide to invest in information receive a sample from the true
distribution, while those that invest in the AI-generated sample receive a sample from a version
of the true distribution which is truncated at σtrstandard deviations above and below the mean.
3Full replication code available at:
https://github.com/aristotle-tek/knowledge-collapse
To vary the extent of mass in the tails, we model the true distribution as a Student’s t-distribution
with e.g.10 degrees of freedom. The results are similar for a standard normal distribution, and as
expected the problem of knowledge collapse is more pronounced for wider tails (c.f. Appendix
Figure A1).
While individuals choose whether or not to invest in innovation according to their personal
payoff, when they do so invest they also contribute their knowledge to the public. That is, a public
knowledge probability distribution function (‘public pdf’) is generated by gathering the nsam p=100
most recent samples4and generating an estimate of the truth using kernel density estimation. The
distance between the public pdf an","AI systems, such as large language models , are trained on massive amounts of diverse data. While this allows them to generate a wide range of content, they naturally tend to produce output that is ""centered"" around the most common patterns in the data. This is generally useful, but if people start relying too heavily on these AI systems, it could lead to a phenomenon called ""knowledge collapse."" Knowledge collapse occurs when the diversity of knowledge and understanding in a community starts to diminish, as people become increasingly reliant on the AI-generated ""average"" content rather than seeking out more diverse and nuanced information. This could harm innovation and the richness of human culture and understanding. However, unlike AI models that are limited to the data they are trained on, humans have the ability to strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to be valuable. The paper provides a simple model to explore the conditions under which knowledge collapse might occur in a community of learners or innovators."

Abstract
Embeddings from Large Language Models
(LLMs) have emerged as critical components
in various applications, particularly for infor-
mation retrieval. While high-dimensional em-
beddings generally demonstrate superior per-
formance as they contain more salient infor-
mation, their practical application is frequently
hindered by elevated computational latency and
the associated higher cost. To address these
challenges, we propose Matryoshka-Adaptor, a
novel tuning framework designed for the cus-
tomization of LLM embeddings. Matryoshka-
Adaptor facilitates substantial dimensionality
reduction while maintaining comparable per-
formance levels, thereby achieving a signifi-
cant enhancement in computational efficiency
and cost-effectiveness. Our framework directly
modifies the embeddings from pre-trained
LLMs which is designed to be seamlessly inte-
grated with any LLM architecture, encompass-
ing those accessible exclusively through black-
box APIs. Also, it exhibits efficacy in both
unsupervised and supervised learning settings.
A rigorous evaluation conducted across a di-
verse corpus of English, multilingual, and mul-
timodal datasets consistently reveals substan-
tial gains with Matryoshka-Adaptor. Notably,
with Google and OpenAI Embedding APIs,
Matryoshka-Adaptor achieves a reduction in
dimensionality ranging from two- to twelve-
fold without compromising performance across
multiple BEIR datasets.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have showcased
remarkable proficiency in handling various text
processing tasks, encompassing question answer-
ing, summarization, and mathematical reasoning
(Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Zhang
et al., 2022a). This success can be partially at-
tributed to their ability to transform raw text into se-
mantically enriched representations, with the qual-
ity of these text-to-embedding mappings being of

paramount importance (Ouyang et al., 2022).
Embeddings find extensive utilization in a wide
array of downstream tasks, with information re-
trieval (IR) serving as a prominent one (Wang et al.,
2023; Muennighoff et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023). IR
involves the process of searching for relevant in-
formation within a corpus database using queries,
and language modeling plays a pivotal role as both
queries and corpus data are frequently textual in
nature. In IR systems, text embeddings are com-
monly employed to rank relevant corpora based on
their similarity to queries.
Numerous LLMs have been developed specifi-
cally for extracting embeddings from raw text, in-
cluding Sentence T5 (Ni et al., 2021), OpenAI Em-
bedding APIs (ope), and Google Embedding APIs
(gcp). However, generation of high-dimensional
1arXiv:2407.20243v1 [cs.CL] 17 Jul 2024
embeddings often entail high latency and computa-
tional costs, thereby limiting their practical appli-
cation in latency-sensitive scenarios such as large-
scale recommendation systems.
Matryoshka representation learning (MRL)
(Kusupati et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2024) addresses
this limitation at pretraining stage, by generating
embeddings that retain similar characteristics even
when utilizing only a subset of their dimensions
(i.e., Matryoshka properties). This enables efficient
similarity comparisons with lower-dimensional em-
beddings and is leveraged by many state-of-the-art
models, including those from Google and OpenAI
(Lee et al., 2024; ope).
In this study, we present Matryoshka-Adaptor, a
novel framework designed to transform arbitrary
embeddings into embeddings with Matryoshka
properties in both unsupervised and supervised
learning setups. In an unsupervised learning setting,
the adaptor learns to transform input embeddings
into Matryoshka embeddings using only corpus
embeddings. We introduced pairwise and top-k
similarity loss functions to facilitate this process.
In supervised learning setup, the adaptor can be
further refined by incorporating relevant (query,
corpus) pairs as labeled tuning data. Note that
we customize embeddings to better suit specific
datasets, using both unsupervised and supervised
approaches. This refinement results in improved
Matryoshka properties, surpassing even those of
embeddings derived from MRL-trained models.
Extensive experiments conducted across 13
BEIR datasets (Thakur et al., 2021), 17 MIR-
ACL datasets (Zhang et al., 2022b), and 5 mul-
timodal Fashion-200K datasets (Han et al., 2017)
validate the effectiveness of Matryoshka-Adaptor.
We demonstrate significant performance improve-
ments over the latest Google (for English only,
multilingual, and multimodal data) (Lee et al.,
2024) and OpenAI text embedding models (ope).
Matryoshka-Adaptor exhibits broad applicability to
diverse embedding types, encompassing text, mul-
timodal, multilingual, and use case-specific embed-
dings. The contributions of this paper are threefold:
•We propose a novel tuning framework,
Matryoshka-Adaptor that achieves substantial
dimensionality reduction in embeddings without
sacrificing performance achieved by tailoring
embeddings to better fit specific datasets.
•Matryoshka-Adaptor is applicable in both un-
supervised and supervised settings, consistentlyimproving retrieval performance across various
datasets. Also, Matryoshka-Adaptor demon-
strates a roughly two-fold (unsupervised) and
six-fold (supervised) reduction in dimensionality,
with no loss in performance.
•The benefits of Matryoshka-Adaptor extend to
multimodal learning and multilingual scenarios.
2 Related Work
Matryoshka embeddings. (Kusupati et al., 2022)
pioneered the development of embedding models
whose representations could be substantially re-
duced in dimensionality without incurring a sig-
nificant degradation in performance. These Ma-
tryoshka embedding models are specifically trained
to ensure the utility of such truncated embeddings.
The Matryoshka properties inherent in these mod-
els enable fine-grained control over the trade-off
between latency and accuracy in downstream tasks
utilizing the embeddings. Given this advantage,
recent embedding models, including those from
OpenAI and Google (Lee et al., 2024), have inte-
grated Matryoshka properties by employing Ma-
tryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) during
pre-training. Our proposed work further enhances
the Matryoshka properties through tuning. We in-
troduce modifications to embeddings that are tai-
lored to target datasets in both an unsupervised
and supervised tuning setups. The proposed tun-
ing yields enhanced Matryoshka properties com-
pared to the original embeddings, even those de-
rived from MRL-trained models.
Dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality
reduction is a well-established framework for re-
ducing the dimensionality of vectors while preserv-
ing their inherent properties. Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016), In-
dependent Component Analysis (ICA) (Hyvärinen
and Oja, 2000), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-
tion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 2000) are widely used
unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (McLachlan,
2005) is a supervised method that leverages labeled
data for dimensionality reduction. While ICA is
possible, its limitations in this context arise due
to the equal importance of all components, requir-
ing separate model training for each reduced di-
mension. NMF, on the other hand, is not suitable
for this application as it is only applicable to non-
negative embeddings. Also, PCA’s orthogonality
properties may limit its reliability for dimension-
2
ality reduction for vectors with highly non-linear
relationships, especially at high dimensionality.
Embedding customization. In lieu of em-
ploying a single unified model for zero-shot re-
trieval, embedding customization tailored to indi-
vidual datasets presents a viable alternative. TART
(Asai et al., 2022) constructs a retrieval system that
adapts retrieval based on instructions, incorporating
different tasks (e.g. for code, question, or answer)
to enhance dense embedding retrieval. Instruc-
tOR (Su et al., 2022) integrates task and domain
descriptions for retrieval while tuning embedding
models. Promptagator (Dai et al., 2022) leverages
in-context learning to generate synthetic query-
corpus pairs using a limited number of original
pairs, subsequently fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
with these synthetic pairs. Search-Adaptor (Yoon
et al., 2023) customizes embeddings for informa-
tion retrieval using a small number of query-corpus
pairs in supervised learning setup. Unlike these
approaches, Matryoshka-Adaptor is applicable to
both supervised and unsupervised settings, elimi-
nating the need for labeled query-corpus pairs. Ad-
ditionally, Matryoshka-Adaptor aims not only to
enhance full-dimensional embedding performance
but also to improve performance across all reduced-
dimensionality embeddings.
3 Unsupervised Matryoshka-Adaptor
3.1 Problem formulation
To facilitate a clear understanding, the proposed
framework is formulated within the context of
information retrieval. However, it is crucial to
emphasize that it can be readily generalized to
any application involving embeddings. In unsu-
pervised settings, we assume the availability of a
corpus set, denoted as C={c1, c2, ..., c N}and
a pre-trained embedding model ( E). The embed-
dings extracted from the corpus are represented as
CE={ce1, ce 2, ..., ce N}, where each embedding
vector cei=E(ci)∈Rd. Notably, our framework
permits the embedding model, E, to be treated as a
black-box model, and Matryoshka-Adaptor can be
directly applied to the extracted embeddings, CE.
A Matryoshka embedding, characterized by m
dimensions, is defined as the initial mdimensions
of the original d-dimensional embedding, where
m < d . This can be expressed as CE[:m] =
{ce1[:m], ce 2[:m], ..., ce N[:m]}where each re-
duced embedding vector cei[:m]∈Rm. A funda-
mental characteristic of Matryoshka embeddings is

mize the Matryoshka properties through this cus-
tomization process. This means ensuring the simi-
larity between any two embeddings remains as con-
sistent as possible, whether they are represented in
the original high-dimensional space or the reduced
low-dimensional space.
To achieve this objective, we introduce two loss
functions. The first loss function, denoted as Lpair,
is designed to preserve the pairwise similarity be-
tween the original embeddings in their reduced-
dimension Matryoshka form, expressed as:
Lpair=X
iX
jX
m|Sim(cei, cej)− (1)
Sim(f(cei)[:m], f(cej)[:m])|,

Unsupervised Matryoshka-Adaptor : This variant exclusively utilizes corpus embeddings as input. The training of
the adaptor is achieved through a combination of top-k similarity loss and pairwise loss, which are calculated across
multiple Matryoshka embeddings with various reduced dimensions. Supervised Matryoshka-Adaptor : In this variant,
query embeddings and query-corpus pairs are provided as supplementary inputs. A ranking loss is incorporated
alongside the top-k and pairwise losses to facilitate the training of the adaptor. Similar to the unsupervised setting,
all losses are computed across Matryoshka embeddings with various reduced dimensions.
where Sim represents an arbitrary similarity func-
tion, which is chosen to be the cosine similarity.
The second loss function, denoted as Ltopk, fo-
cuses on preserving local similarity relationships
among neighboring embeddings:
Ltopk=X
iX
j∈NN k(i)X
m|Sim(cei, cej)−(2)
Sim(f(cei)[:m], f(cej)[:m])|,
where NNk(i)denotes the set of the top k most
similar embeddings to cei. A visual representation
of these two loss functions, illustrating their appli-
cation across multiple Matryoshka embeddings of
varying dimensions, is provided in Fig. 2.
In order to mitigate any substantial deviation
from the original embeddings, we have integrated
regularizations into our methodology. Primarily, a
skip connection is implemented within the architec-
ture of the learnable function, f, ensuring that this
function learns solely the difference from the origi-
nal embedding, represented as ˆcei=cei+f(cei).
Furthermore, a reconstruction loss, denoted as Lrec,
is introduced as an additional regularizer:
Lrec=X
i|cei−f(cei)|. (3)
The overall objective function, designed to mini-
mize the aggregate loss, is given as:
min
fLtopk(f) +αLpair(f) +βLrec(f),(4)withα, β > 0being hyperparameters. Within the
context of the unsupervised tuning setting, we fix
their values as α= 1.0, β= 1.0.

4.1 Problem formulation
For many information retrieval applications, the
availability of pairwise data, which indicates the
relevance between specific queries and corpora, can
considerably improve retrieval performance (Yoon
et al., 2023). In this section, we introduce a method
to further refine the Matryoshka-Adaptor by utiliz-
ing (a limited number of) such paired samples.
LetQ={q1, q2, ..., q M}denote the set of
queries, and let R={(qi, cj, yij)}i=1:M,j =1:Nrep-
resent the set of query-corpus relevance triplets,
where yij>0signifies the relevance score be-
tween query qiand corpus cj. The query embed-
dings extracted from the model ( E) are denoted
asQE={qe1, qe 2, ..., qe N}with each query em-
bedding vector qei=E(qi)∈Rd. Further-
more, we define Matryoshka query embeddings
asQE[:m] ={qe1[:m], qe 2[:m], ..., qe N[:m]},
where qei[:m]∈Rm. Note that mcan be any in-
teger less than the original embedding dimension.
4.2 Tuning objective functions
In the supervised setting, the Matryoshka-Adaptor
(f) undergoes optimization to enhance both its Ma-
tryoshka properties and the retrieval performance

of the Matryoshka embeddings. This is accom-
plished through the utilization of paired query-
corpus samples, in conjunction with the original
query and corpus embeddings. Matryoshka rank-
ing loss, denoted as Lrank, is introduced to align
the ranking between query and corpus considering
different Matryoshka embedding dimensions:
Lrank=X
iX
jX
kX
mI(yij> yik) (5)
(yij−yik) log(1 + exp( sik[:m]−sij[:m])),
where sij[:m]represents the cosine similarity
between the adapted query embedding ˆqei[:m]
(where ˆqei=qei+f(qei)) and the adapted corpus
embedding ˆcej[:m]. We use the same adaptor ( f)
for both query and corpus embeddings. This rank-
ing loss is crucial for effective learning of lower
dimensional representations with their information
content for the ranking objective being considered.
The supervised Matryoshka-Adaptor is trained
using a joint objective function that encompasses
the ranking loss as well as the unsupervised Ma-
tryoshka losses ( Ltopk,Lpair, andLrec). This joint
training approach aims to improve the quality of
the embeddings while preserving their Matryoshka
representations. Query-corpus pairs are employed
for the ranking loss, while query and corpus embed-
dings are utilized for the Matryoshka representation
learning. The overall objective function is:
min
fLtopk(f) +αLpair(f)+ (6)
βLrec(f) +γLrank(f),
withα, β, γ ≥0being hyper-parameters with fixed
values as α= 1.0, β= 1.0andγ= 1.0.To improve convergence, two-stage training
strategy is employed. Initially, the Matryoshka-
Adaptor is trained in an unsupervised way using
Eq. 4. Subsequently, further tuning is conducted in
a supervised way, utilizing Eq. 6.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental settings
The Matryoshka-Adaptor is extensively evaluated
across a diverse set of 13 BEIR datasets (bei),
17 MIRACL datasets (mir), and 5 Fashion-200K
datasets (Han et al., 2017). Such a comprehensive
evaluation highlights the data-agnostic nature of
the Matryoshka-Adaptor. Query and corpus embed-
dings are generated using state-of-the-art models,
including Google Gecko text embeddings (English
and multilingual) (gcp), Google multimodal em-
beddings, and OpenAI text embeddings (ope). This
further highlights the model-agnostic nature of the
proposed Matryoshka-Adaptor.
During the evaluation phase, both query
and corpus embeddings are transformed using
the trained Matryoshka-Adaptor. Cosine sim-
ilarity is then computed between the trans-
formed query and corpus embeddings across
a spectrum of reduced dimensions (e.g., d=
{8,16,32,64,128,256,512,768}for Gecko text
embeddings). Retrieval performance is evaluated
using the normalized discounted cumulative gain at
rank 10 (nDCG@10) metric (Järvelin and Kekäläi-
nen, 2002), facilitating a comprehensive assess-
ment of performance across various Matryoshka
embedding dimensions. All reported results rep-
resent the average value across the datasets. Data

ments can be found in Appendix. A and B. Detailed
results can be found in Appendix. E and F.
5.2 Unsupervised tuning
The Matryoshka-Adaptor can be applied exclu-
sively with corpus embeddings, referred to as the
unsupervised setting, enabling customization of
embeddings solely on the corpus side. In this sub-
section, we present the impact of the unsupervised
Matryoshka-Adaptor on two OpenAI text embed-
ding models and compare its performance with
the commonly-used unsupervised dimensionality
reduction method, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) (Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016).
Fig. 4a and 4b illustrate that the Matryoshka-
Adaptor yields significant performance improve-
ments, particularly for lower dimensions, compared
to the embeddings of the same dimensionality with-
out it. Furthermore, lower dimensional embed-
dings processed with Matryoshka-Adaptor achieve
comparable performance to original embeddings
of high dimensionality. The adaptor achieves a
faster saturation in performance with embedding
dimensionality, towards the retrieval performance
of original embeddings, underscoring its substan-
tial impact in significantly reducing latency and
memory requirements for retrieval applications.
Notably, the latest OpenAI embeddings are
already trained with Matryoshka Representation
Learning (MRL) (ope). The additional perfor-
mance gains achieved by Matryoshka-Adaptor are
attributed to the tuning process. With PCA, some
improvements are observed for lower dimensions,
however, at higher dimensions, noticeable per-
formance degradation occurs, resulting in perfor-mance inferior even to the original embedding.
This highlights the superiority of the Matryoshka-
Adaptor, designed with the goal of salient informa-
tion preservation for similarity within lower dimen-
sions compared to PCA, a generic unsupervised
dimensionality reduction approach.
5.3 Supervised tuning
The Matryoshka-Adaptor can be applied in super-
vised learning setup where a limited number of
query-corpus pairs are available. In this context,
the Supervised Matryoshka-Adaptor is trained uti-
lizing paired query-corpus data. The effectiveness
of the Supervised Matryoshka-Adaptor is evaluated
on 13 BEIR, 17 MIRACL, and 5 Fashion-200K
datasets, with query and corpus embeddings being
generated using the latest Google Gecko models,
including its multilingual and multimodal versions.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the Supervised
Matryoshka-Adaptor consistently outperforms the
alternatives, such as Search-Adaptor (Yoon et al.,
2023), particularly for lower embedding dimen-
sions. Additionally, lower dimensional embed-
dings processed with the Supervised Matryoshka-
Adaptor perform comparably to high dimensional
embeddings, showcasing its potential to signifi-
cantly reduce latency and memory requirements
for applications like retrieval.
5.4 Tuning for Multimodal Embeddings
As previously established, the Matryoshka-Adaptor
framework is not confined to text embeddings
but can be generalized to multimodal embed-
dings as well. To illustrate this capability, we ap-
plied the Matryoshka-Adaptor to the latest gecko-
multimodal embeddings, utilizing the Fashion-

signed for text-to-image retrieval tasks.
Fig. 4c and 5c demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Matryoshka-Adaptor in consistently improving
the performance of multimodal base embedding
models for text-to-image retrieval tasks. These
highlight that the Matryoshka-Adaptor significantly
outperforms alternative methods such as PCA, in
unsupervised learning setups and Search-Adaptor
in supervised learning setups, particularly when
lower embedding dimensions are considered.
5.5 Tuning for Multilingual Embeddings
Matryoshka-Adaptor is not only model-agnostic
but also data-agnostic. Its applicability even ex-
tends beyond a single language. To validate
this, we evaluate the performance of Matryoshka-
Adaptor on MIRACL datasets, which comprise 17
non-English languages.
Fig. 6b and 5b present the results of apply-
ing Matryoshka-Adaptor to multilingual retrieval
tasks. The findings demonstrate that the perfor-
mance gains achieved through the proposed tun-
ing method are not limited to English but also ex-
tend to non-English language datasets. Further-
more, the improvements are observed to be model-
agnostic, as evident from the successful application
of Matryoshka-Adaptor to the latest Gecko multi-
lingual embedding models.
6 Discussions
6.1 Models that are not pretrained with MRL
A significant advantage of the Matryoshka-Adaptor
framework lies in its broad applicability to a wide
array of embedding models. We demonstrate theefficacy of Matryoshka-Adaptor when applied to
embedding models that have not been trained using
MRL. Specifically, we utilize earlier versions of
the Gecko embedding models (Google Gecko-003),
which do not utilize MRL in their pretraining, in
conjunction with BEIR datasets to illustrate the
impact of the Unsupervised Matryoshka-Adaptor.
Fig. 6c presents evidence of the consis-
tent performance improvements achieved by the
Matryoshka-Adaptor when applied to non-MRL
trained embedding models. This observation under-
scores that the performance gains of Matryoshka-
Adaptor originate from customizing the embedding
to the specific corpus, and this beneficial impact
can be extended to any embedding model, even
when they had been trained with MRL.
6.2 Ablation studies
To examine the individual contribution of each
loss component to the overall performance of
Matryoshka-Adaptor, we conduct ablation studies.
In the unsupervised setting, each of the top-k loss
(Ltopk), pairwise loss ( Lpair), and reconstruction
loss (Lrec) is individually excluded from the origi-
nal loss summation in Eq. 4, and the corresponding
performance degradation is monitored. Specifi-
cally, the pairwise loss was excluded by setting
α= 0, and the reconstruction loss is excluded by
setting β= 0. In the supervised setting, we utilize
only the ranking loss ( Lrank) to assess the impact
of three unsupervised losses in Eq. 6.
As evident in Table 1, each loss function con-
tributes uniquely to the overall performance of
Matryoshka-Adaptor in the unsupervised setting.
Notably, Ltopkis particularly beneficial for higher
dimensions. In the supervised setting, the incor-

cluding LtopkandLpair, is critical for achieving
performance improvements. Without these unsu-
pervised losses, the performance gain diminishes
by approximately 50%.
6.3 Relationship with distance metrics
In unsupervised learning setup, the absence of la-
beled data presents a challenge in evaluating the
impact of Matryoshka-Adaptor. Towards circum-
venting this issue and shedding light on the impact
of dimensionality reduction, we analyze the aver-
age pairwise distances and top-k distances within
the corpus embeddi","The paper presents a method called Matryoshka-Adaptor that can take a large, complex language model and compress it down to a smaller, more efficient version without losing too much performance. The basic idea is to first learn an ""unsupervised"" mapping that translates the original large model's representations into a compressed format. This is like squeezing a big matryoshka doll into a smaller one without losing the core features. Then, the compressed model is ""supervised fine-tuned"" on specific tasks, further optimizing it for those applications. This allows the compressed model to maintain high performance, even though it's much smaller than the original. The key benefit is that you get a model that is significantly more compact and efficient, but still retains most of the capabilities of the larger, more complex original. This could be very useful for deploying language AI on devices with limited memory or compute resources."

Abstract
In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) as originally introduced in (Hu et al.,
2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models
with large width (embedding dimension). This
is due to the fact that adapter matrices Aand
Bin LoRA are updated with the same learning
rate. Using scaling arguments for large width
networks, we demonstrate that using the same
learning rate for AandBdoes not allow
efficient feature learning. We then show that this
suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply
by setting different learning rates for the LoRA
adapter matrices AandBwith a well-chosen
fixed ratio. We call this proposed algorithm
LoRA +. In our extensive experiments, LoRA +
improves performance ( 1%−2%improvements)
and finetuning speed (up to ∼2X SpeedUp), at
the same computational cost as LoRA.
1. Introduction
State-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models all share
a common characteristic: they all have an extremely
large number of parameters (10’s if not 100’s of billions
parameters). Currently, only a few industry labs can
pretrain large language models due to their high training
cost. However, many pretrained models are accessible
either through an API (GPT4, (OpenAI, 2023)) or through
open-source platforms (Llama, (Touvron et al., 2023)).
Most practitioners are interested in using such models
for specific tasks and want to adapt these models to a
new, generally smaller task. This procedure is known as
finetuning , where one adjusts the weights of the pretrained
model to improve performance on the new task. However,
due to the size of SOTA models, adapting to down-stream
tasks with full finetuning (finetuning all model parameters)

by the author(s).is computationally infeasible as it requires modifying the
weights of the pretrained models using gradient methods
which is a costly process. Besides, a model that has already
learned generally useful representations during pretraining
would not require in-principle significant adaptation of all
parameters. With this intuition, researchers have proposed
a variety of resource-efficient finetuning methods which
typically freeze the pretrained weights and tune only a
small set of newly inserted parameters. Such methods
include prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) where a “soft
prompt"" is learned and appended to the input, the adapters
method (Houlsby et al., 2019) where lightweight “adapter""
layers are inserted and trained, and (IA)3(Liu et al.,
2022) where activation vectors are modified with learned
scalings. Another resource-efficient method is known as
Low Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2021), or simply LoRA.
In LoRA finetuning, only a low rank matrix, called an
adapter , that is added to the pretrained weights is trainable.
The training can be done with any optimizer and in practice
a common choice is Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Since
the trained adapter is low-rank, this effectively reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the fine-tuning process,
significantly decreasing the training cost. On many tasks
such as instruction finetuning, LoRA has been shown
to achieve comparable or better performance compared
with full-finetuning (Wang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023),
although on complicated, long form generation tasks, it is
not always as performant. The impressive performance and
the computational savings of LoRA have contributed to it
becoming an industry standard finetuning method.
Efficient use of LoRA requires a careful choice of
hyperparameters: the rank and the learning rate. While
some theoretical guidelines on the choice of the rank in
LoRA exist in the literature (see e.g. Zeng and Lee (2023)),
there are no principled guidelines on how to set the learning
rate, apart from common choices of order 1e-4.
Related Work. Dettmers et al. (2023) introduced a
quantized version of LoRA (or QLoRA), which further
reduces computation costs by quantizing pretrained
weights down to as few as four bits. Using QLoRA enables
fine-tuning Llama-65b (Touvron et al., 2023), on a single
consumer GPU while achieving competitive performance
with full-finetuning. To further improve LoRA training
with quantization, Li et al. (2023) introduced a new

Figure 1. The key difference between standard LoRA and
LoRA +is in how learning rates are set (the matrices GAand
GBare ‘effective’ gradients from AdamW) With standard LoRA,
the learning rate is the same for AandB, which provably leads
to suboptimal learning when embedding dimension is large. In
LoRA +, we set the learning rate of Bto be λ×that of A, where
λ≫1is fixed. We later provide guidelines on how to set λ.
method called LoftQ for computing a better initialization
for quantized training. Additional variations of LoRA
have been proposed such as VeRA (Kopiczko et al., 2023)
which freezes random weight tied adapters and learns
vector scalings of the internal adapter activations. This
achieves a further reduction in the number of trainable
parameters while achieving comparable performance to
LoRA on several NLP finetuning tasks. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there is no principled guidance for
setting LoRA learning rate which is the focus of our work.
Contributions. We provide guidelines for setting the
learning rate through a theory of scaling for neural
networks. There is a significant number of works on the
scaling of neural networks from the infinite width/depth
perspective. The approach is simple: take the width/depth
of a neural network to infinity,1understand how the
limit depends on the choice of the hyperparameters
in the training process such as the learning rate and
initialization variance, then derive principled choices for
these hyperparameters to achieve some desired goal (e.g.
improve feature learning). Examples of the infinite-width
limit include works on initialization schemes such as (He
et al., 2016; Yang, 2019), or more holistically network
parametrizations such as (Yang and Hu, 2021) where the
authors introduced µP, a neural network parameterization
ensuring feature learning in the infinite-width limit,
offering precise scaling rules for architecture and learning
rates to maximize feature learning. Examples for the
depth limit include initialization strategies (Schoenholz

with fixed depth and vice-versa, or both at the same time. See
Appendix A.1 for more details.et al., 2017a; He et al., 2023; Hayou et al., 2019), block
scaling (see e.g. (Hayou et al., 2021; Hayou, 2023; Noci
et al., 2023)), depth parametrizations (Yang et al., 2023;
Bordelon et al., 2023) etc. Here we propose to use the
same strategy to derive scaling rules for the learning rate in
LoRA for finetuning. More precisely, we study the infinite-
width limit of LoRA finetuning dynamics and show that
standard LoRA setup is suboptimal. We correct this by
introducing a new method called LoRA +that improves
feature learning in low rank adaptation in the this limit.
The key innovation in LoRA +is setting different learning
rates for AandBmodules (LoRA modules) as explained in
Figure 1. Our theory is validated with extensive empirical
results with different language of models and tasks.

small devices (limited GPUs), resource-efficient finetuning
methods like LoRA significantly reduce the computational
cost by considering low rank weight matrices instead of full
rank finetuning (or simply full finetuning).
Definition 1 (Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) from (Hu et al.,
2021)) .For any weight matrix W∈Rn1×n2in the
pretrained model, we constrain its update in the fine-
tuning process by representing the latter with a low-rank
decomposition W=W∗+α
rBA. Here, only the weight
matrices B∈Rn1×r,A∈Rr×n2are trainable. The rank
r≪min(n1, n2)andα∈Rare tunable constants.
Scaling of Neural Networks. It is well known that as the
width ngrows, the network initialization scheme and the
learning should be adapted to avoid numerical instabilities
and ensure efficient learning. For instance, the variance
of the initialization weights (in hidden layers) should
scale 1/nto prevent arbitrarily large pre-activations as we
increase model width n(e.g. He init (He et al., 2016)).
To derive such scaling rules, a principled approach consist
2
Efficient Low Rank Adaptation
of analyzing statistical properties of key quantities in the
model (e.g. pre-activations) as ngrows and then adjust the
initialization, the learning rate, and the architecture itself
to achieve desirable properties in the limit n→ ∞ (Hayou
et al., 2019; Schoenholz et al., 2017b; Yang, 2019; Yang
and Littwin, 2023). This approach is used in this paper to
study feature learning dynamics with LoRA in the infinite-
width limit. This will allow us to derive scaling rules for the
learning rates of LoRA modules. For more details about the
theory of scaling of neural networks, see Appendix A.1.
Notation. Hereafter, we use the following notation to
describe the asymptotic behaviour as the width ngrows.
Given sequences cn∈Randdn∈R+, we write cn=
O(dn), resp. cn= Ω( dn), to refer to cn< κd n, resp.
cn> κd n, for some constant κ >0. We write cn= Θ( dn)
if both cn=O(dn)andcn= Ω( dn)are satisfied. For
vector sequences cn= (ci
n)1≤i≤k∈Rk(for some k >0),
we write cn=O(dn)when ci
n=O(di
n)for all i∈[k],
and same holds for other asymptotic notations. Finally,
when the sequence cnis a vector of random variables,
convergence is understood to be convergence in second
moment ( L2norm).
3. An Intuitive Analysis of LoRA
Our intuition is simple: the matrices AandBhave
“transposed” shapes and one would naturally ask whether
the learning rate should be set differently for the two
matrices. In practice, most SOTA models have large width
(embedding dimension). Thus, it makes sense to study the
training dynamics when the width goes to infinity.
3.1. LoRA with a Toy Model
Consider the following linear model
f(x) = (W∗+ba⊤)x, (2)
where W∗∈R1×nare the pretrained weights, b∈R, a∈
Rnare LoRA weights,2x∈Rnis the model input.
This setup corresponds to n1= 1, n2=n, r= 1 in
Definition 1. We assume that the weights W∗are fixed
(from pretraining). The goal is to minimize the loss L(θ) =
1
2(f(x)−y)2where θ= (a, b)and(x, y)is an input-output
datapoint.3We assume that x= Θ n(1)which means that
input coordinates remain of the same order as we increase
width. In the following, we analyze the behaviour of the
finetuning dynamics as model width ngrows.
2Here, we consider n2= 1 to simplify the analysis. All the
conclusions remain essentially valid when n2=n1=n.
3For simplicity, we assume that the finetuning dataset consists
of a single sample. Our analysis is readily generalizable to
multiple samples.Initialization. We consider a Gaussian initialization of
the weights as follows: ai∼ N (0, σ2
a),b∼ N (0, σ2
b).4
With LoRA, we generally want to initialize the product ba⊤
to be 0so that finetuning starts from the pretrained model.
This implies at least one of the weights aandbis initialized
to0. If both are initialized to 0, it is trivial that no learning
occurs in this case since this is a saddle point. Thus, we
should initialize one of the parameters aandbto be non-
zero and the other to be zero. If we choose a non-zero
initialization for a, then following standard initialization
schemes (e.g., He Init (He et al., 2016), LeCun Init (LeCun
et al., 2002)), one should set σ2
a= Θ( n−1)to ensure a⊤x
does not explode with width. This is justified by the Central
Limit Theorem (CLT).5On the other hand, if we choose
a non-zero initialization for b, one should make sure that
σ2
b= Θ(1) . This leaves us with two possible schemes:
•Init[1] :σ2
b= 0, σ2
a= Θ( n−1).
•Init[2] :σ2
b= Θ(1) , σ2
a= 0.
Our analysis will only consider these two initialization
schemes for LoRA modules, although the results should
in-principle hold for other schemes, providing that stability
(as discussed above) is satisfied.
Learning rate. WLOG, we can simplify the analysis by
assuming that W∗= 0. This can be achieved by setting
˜y=y−W∗x. The gradients are given by
∂L
∂b=a⊤x(f(x)−y),∂L
∂a=b(f(x)−y)x.
We use subscript tto denote the finetuning step. Let Ut=
(ft(x)−y). At step twith learning rate η >0, we have
∆ftdef=ft(x)−ft−1(x) =−ηb2

The update in model output is driven by the three terms
(δi
t)i∈{1,2,3}. The first two terms represent “linear”
contributions to the update, i.e. change in model output
driven by fixing band updating aand vice-versa. These
terms are order one in η. The third term δ3
trepresents a
multiplicative update, compounding the updates in aandb,
and is an order two term in η. As ngrows, a desirable
property is that ∆ft= Θ(1) . Intuitively, this means
4The Gaussian distribution can be replaced by any other
distribution with finite variance.
5Technically, the CLT only ensures the almost sure
convergence, the L2convergence follows from the Dominated
Convergence Theorem. We omit these technical details in this
paper.
3
Efficient Low Rank Adaptation
that as we scale the width, feature updates do not ‘suffer’
from this scaling (see Appendix A.1 for more details). An
example of a scenario where feature learning is affected
by scaling is the lazy training regime (Jacot et al., 2018),
where feature updates are of order Θ(n−1/2)which implies
that no feature learning occurs in the limit n→ ∞ . The
condition ∆ft= Θ(1) also implies that the update does
not explode with width, which is also a desirable property.
Having ∆ft= Θ(1) satisfied implies that at least one of
the three terms (δi
t)i∈{1,2,3}isΘ(1) . Ideally, we want both
δ1
tandδ2
tto be Θ(1) because otherwise it means that either
aorbis not efficiently updated. For instance, if δ1
t=o(1),
it means that as n→ ∞ , the model acts as if ais fixed
and only bis trained. Similar conclusions hold when δ2
t=
o(1). Having both δ1
tandδ2
tbeing Θ(1) in width means
that both aandbparameter updates significantly contribute
to the change in ft(x), and we say that feature learning with
LoRA is efficient when this is the case, i.e. δt
i= Θ(1) for
i∈ {1,2}and all t >1. We will formalize this definition
of efficiency in the next section. The reader might wonder
why we do not require that δ3
tbeΘ(1) . We will see that
when both δ1
tandδ2
tareΘ(1) , the term δ3
tis also Θ(1) .
Efficiency Analysis. Let us assume that we train the
model with gradient descent with learning rate η= Θ( nc)
for some c∈R, and suppose that we initialize the model
withInit[1] . Sine the training dynamics are mainly
matrix vector products, sum of vectors/scalars etc (see
(Yang et al., 2022)),6it is easy to see that any quantity
in the training dynamics should be of order nγfor some
γ∈R. For any quantity vin the training dynamics, we
write v= Θ( nγ[v]). When vis a vector, we use the same
notation when all entries of vareΘ(nγ[v]). The γnotation
is formally defined in Appendix A.
Starting from initialization, we have f0(x) = 0 . LoRA
finetuning is efficient when δ1
t= Θ(1) andδ2
t= Θ(1) for
allt >1,7andft(x) = Θ(1) fort >1. This translate to


t−1x] = 0 ( δ2
t= Θ(1))
γ[bt−1] +γ[a⊤
t−1x] = 0 ( ft−1(x) = Θ(1))
Solving this equation yields c=−1/2, i.e. the learning
6A crucial assumption for this to hold is also to have that for
any matrix/vector product in the training dynamics, the product
dimension (the dimension along which the matrix/vector product
is calculated) is Θ(nα)for some α > 0. For instance, in the
case of Transformers, this is satisfied since the MLP embedding
dimension is generally k×n. However, this condition would be
violated if for instance one considers MLP embedding dimension
knlog(n). Such non-standard scaling choices require a particular
treatment, but the conclusions remain the same.
7Here we use the t >1instead of t >0because at t≤1, at
least one the terms δ1

efficient feature learning. At initialization, b0= 0 and

an inductive argument, for t > 0,btwill be of order
Θ(n−1/2)anda⊤
txwill be of order Θ(1) , yielding ft(x) =
Θ(n−1/2). Indeed, at each iteration the update to btwill be
of order Θ(ηya⊤
t−1x) = Θ( n−1/2)and the updates to at
are of order Θ(ηbt−1yx) = Θ( n−1). Asft= Θ( n−1/2),
this yields a contradiction towards learning Θ(1) features.
This shows that we cannot have both δ1
tandδ2
tto be Θ(1)
with this parametrization (also true with Init[2] ). We
formalize this result in the next proposition and refer the
reader to Appendix A for further technical details.
Proposition 1 (Inefficiency of LoRA fine-tuning) .Assume
that LoRA weights are initialized with Init[1] or
Init[2] and trained with gradient descent with learning
rateη= Θ( nc)for some c∈R. Then, it is impossible to
haveδi
t= Θ(1) fori∈ {1,2}for any t >0, and therefore,
fine-tuning with LoRA in this setup is inefficient.
In conclusion, efficiency cannot be achieved with this
parametrization of the learning rate. This suggests
that standard LoRA finetuning as currently used by
practitioners is suboptimal, especially when model width
is large, which is a property that is largely satsified
in practice ( n≈700 for GPT2 and n≈4000 for
LLama). This analysis suggests that we are missing crucial
hyperparameters in the standard LoRA setup. Indeed, we
show that by decoupling the learning rate for aandb, we
can have δi
t= Θ(1) fori∈ {1,2,3}. We write ηa, ηbto
denote the learning rates. The analysis conducted above
remains morally the same with the only difference being in
the learning rates. Let ηa= Θ( nca)andηb= Θ( ncb),
and assume that weights are initialized with Init[1] .
A similar analysis to the one conducted above show that
having ft(x) = Θ(1) andδi
t= Θ(1) fori∈ {1,2}and
t >0implies that for all t >1


ca+ 2γ[bt−1] + 1 = 0 ( δ1
t= Θ(1))
cb+ 2γ[a⊤
t−1x] = 0 ( δ2
t= Θ(1))
γ[bt−1] +γ[a⊤
t−1x] = 0 ( ft−1(x) = Θ(1))
which, after simple calculations, implies that ca+cb=−1.
This is only a necessary condition. In the next result, taking
also some elements of stability into consideration, we fully
characterize the choice of ηaandηbto ensure efficient
LoRA fine-tuning.
Proposition 2 (Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA) .In the
case of model (2), with ηa= Θ( n−1)andηb= Θ(1) , we
have for all t >1,i∈ {1,2,3},δi
t= Θ(1) .
We refer the reader to Appendix A for more details on the
proof of Proposition 2. In conclusion, scaling the learning

rates as ηa= Θ( n−1)andηb= Θ(1) ensures stability
(∆ft= Θ(1) ) and efficiency of LoRA finetuning ( δi
t=
Θ(1) fori∈ {1,2}andt >1) in the infinite-width limit.
In practice, this means that the learning rate for bshould
be generally much larger than that of a. This remains true
even if b∈Rrfor general r. We will later see that this
scaling is valid for general neural network models.

3.2. Verifying the Results on a Toy Model
The previous analysis considers a simple linear model.
To assess the validity of the scaling rules in a non-linear
setting, we consider a neural network model given by
f(x) =Woutϕ(BAϕ (Winx)), (3)
where Win∈Rn×d, Wout∈R1×n, A∈Rr×n, B∈
Rn×rare the weights, and ϕis the ReLU function. The
model is trained on a synthetic dataset generated with X∼
N(0, Id), Y= sin( d−1Pd
i=1Xi). See Appendix C for
more details.Only the weight matrices A, B are trained ( Win, Woutare
fixed). We use d= 5, n= 100 , r= 4, train data size
1000 and a test data size 100.8The train/test loss for
varying ηAandηBis reported in Figure 2 at the early
stages of the training ( t= 10 ) and after convergence
(we observed convergence around t≈200for reasonable
choices of learning rates). The red ’ +’ signs represents
learning rates (ηA, ηB)for which the loss is within 1%
range from the best loss and dashed line represents the case
where the learning rates are set equal. We observe that
both the best train and test losses are consistently achieved
by a combination of learning rates where ηb≫ηa, which
validates our analysis in the previous section. Notice also
that optimal learning rates (ηA, ηB)are generally close to
the edge of stability, a well-known behaviour in training
dynamics of deep networks (Cohen et al., 2021).
4. Stability and Feature Learning with LoRA
in the Infinite Width Limit
In this section, we extend the analysis above to general
neural architectures with LoRA layers. We show that the
conclusions from the analysis on the linear model hold for
general neural architectures: 1) using the same learning
rate for both AandBleads to suboptimal feature learning
when model width is large, and 2) this problem can be fixed
by setting different learning rates for AandB.
Since our aim in this paper is primarily methodological, the
theoretical results in this section are of a physics level of
rigor, omitting technical assumptions that would otherwise
make the analysis rigorous but unnecessarily complicated.
In all the results, LoRA rank ris considered fixed and
finetuning dynamics are analyzed in the limit of infinite-
width. This setup fairly represents practical scenarios
where r≪nandris generally small.
Notation. The LoRA weights are initialized with Aij∼
N(0, σ2
A), Bij∼ N(0, σ2
B)for some σA, σB≥0.9Here
also, we assume that either σ2
B= 0 andσ2
A= Θ( n−1)
(Init[1] ), or σ2
B= Θ(1) andσ2
A= 0 (Init[2] ).
Given a LoRA layer in the model, Z denotes the input
to that layer and ¯Zthe output after adding the pretrained
weights. More precisely, we write ¯Z=W∗Z+α
rBAZ.
Our main analysis relies on a careful estimation of the
magnitude of several quantities including LoRA features .
Let us first give a formal definition.
Definition 2 (LoRA Features) .Given a general neural
architecture and a LoRA layer (Definition 1), we define
LoRA features (ZA, ZB)asZA=AZandZB=BZA=

setup.

to setting σB= 0.
5
Efficient Low Rank Adaptation
BAZ. At fine-tuning step t, we use the superscript t
to denote the value of LoRA features Zt
A, Zt
B, and the
subscript tto denote the weights At, Bt.
LoRA layers are 2-layers linear networks with a
“bottleneck” in the middle (since generally r≪n). This
bottleneck shape might induce some numerical challenges
in training stability and efficiency (Definition 3 and
Definition 5).
Finetuning Dataset. To simplify the analysis, we assume
that the finetuning dataset comprises a single sample
(x, y),10and the goal is to minimize the loss L(θ,(x, y))
computed with the underlying model where the adjusted
weights are given by W∗+BA for all LoRA layers
(here θ={A, B, for all LoRA layers in the model }). At
training step t, and for any LoRA layer in the model, Zt
is the input to the LoRA layer, computed with data input
x. Similarly, we write d¯Ztto denote the gradient of the
loss function with respect to the layer output features ¯Z
evaluated at data point (x, y).
The notion of stability of LoRA as discussed in Section 3
can be generalized to any neural network model as follows.
Definition 3 (Stability) .We say that LoRA finetuning is
stable if for all LoRA layers in the model, and all training
steps t, we have Z , ZA, ZB=O(1)asngoes to infinity.
Stability implies that no quantity in the network explodes
as width grows, a desirable property as we scale the
model.11Naturally, in order to ensure stability, one has
to scale hyperparameters (initialization, learning rate) as
ngrows. Scaling rules for initialization are fairly easy to
infer and were already discussed in Section 3 where we
obtained two plausible initialization schemes ( Init[1]
andInit[2] ). More importantly, if we arbitrarily scale
the learning rate with width, we might end up with
suboptimal learning as width grows even if the finetuning is
stable. This is the case for instance when we aggressively
downscale the learning rate with width, or inadequately
parameterize the network (e.g. Neural Tangent Kernel
parametrization which leads to the kernel regime in the
infinite width limit, (Jacot et al., 2018)). To take this into
account, we define a notion of feature learning with LoRA.
Definition 4 (Stable Feature Learning with LoRA) .We say
10This assumption on the finetuning dataset is for simplification
purposes only. All our analysis can be re-written with ‘batched’
gradients and the conclusions remain the same. However, some
additonal assumptions are required to make the analysis rigorous.
11It is possible to define stability as Z , ZB=O(1)and exclude
ZAfrom the condition. This would allow scenarios where for
instance the entries of Aexplode with width but their magnitude
is compensated with a smaller magnitude of B. This system has
one degree of freedom because of the homogeneity of the product
BA, and by imposing that ZA=O(1), we avoid having such
scenarios.that LoRA finetuning induces stable feature learning if it is
stable (Definition 3), and for all LoRA layers and finetuning
stept, we have ∆Zt
Bdef=Zt+1
B−Zt
B= Θ(1) .
A similar definition of feature learning was introduced in
(Yang and Littwin, 2023) for pretraining. This definition
ensures that the network is not ‘stuck’ in a kernel regime
where feature updates are of order O(n−ϵ)in the infinite-
width limit for some ϵ >0, which implies that no feature
learning occurs in the limit. The authors introduced the
µ-parameterization (or maximal update parametrization), a
specific network parameterization (initialization + learning
rate scaling), that ensures that feature updates are Θ(1) .
Note that here we added stability in the definition, but in
principle, one could define feature learning with Ωinstead
ofΘ. The latter covers unstable scenarios (e.g. when
∆Zt
B= Θ( n)due to improper scaling of initialization
and learning rate), so we omit it here and focus on stable
feature learning. Also, notice that we only consider
finetuning dynamics and not the pretraining dynamics.
However, since our analysis depends on weights W∗from
pretraining, we assume that pretraining parameterization
ensures stability and feature learning as width grows (see
Appendix A for more details).12
At finetuning step t, the gradients are given by
∂Lt
∂B=α
rd¯Zt−1⊗At−1Zt−1
∂Lt
∂A=dZt−1
A⊗Zt−1=α

where u⊗vdenotes the outer product uv⊤of vectors u,v,
and the weights are updated as follows
At=At−1−ηAgt−1
A, B t=Bt−1−ηBgt−1
B,
where gA, gBare processed gradients (e.g. normalized
gradients with momentum as in AdamW etc). Hereafter,
we assume that the gradients are processed in a way that
makes their entries Θ(1) . This is generally satisfied in
practice (with Adam for instance) and has been considered
in (Yang and Littwin, 2023) to derive the µ-parametrization
for general gradient processing functions.
Unlike the linear model in Section 3, LoRA feature updates
are not only driven by the change in the A, B weights, but
also Z , d¯Zwhich are updated as we finetune the model
(assuming there are multiple LoRA layers). To isolate the
contribution of individual LoRA layers to feature learning,
12When taking the infinite width limit, we assume that
pretraining parameterization is µP. This is just a technicality for
the infinite-width limit and does not have any implications on
practical scenarios where the width is finite. The most important
implications of this assumption is that in the pretrained network
(before introducing LoRA layers), we have Z = Θ(1) ,¯Z=
Θ(1) , which holds for a general input-output pair (x, y).
6
Efficient Low Rank Adaptation
we assume that only a single LoRA layer is trainable and all
other LoRA layers are frozen.13. In this setting, considering
the only trainable LoRA layer in the model, the layer input
Zis fixed and does not change with t, while d¯Zchanges
with step t(because ¯Zt= (W∗+α
rBtAt)Z). After step t,
ZBis updated a","The paper discusses an issue with a technique called Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that is used to efficiently finetune large language models. LoRA works by adding two small ""adapter"" matrices to the model, which can be updated during finetuning instead of updating the entire model. This makes finetuning faster and more efficient. However, the researchers found that when finetuning very large models (with large ""embedding dimensions""), the standard LoRA approach doesn't work as well. This is because LoRA updates the two adapter matrices with the same learning rate, but the researchers show that for large models, the adapter matrices need to be updated at different rates for best performance. To fix this, the researchers propose a simple modification called ""LoRA+"" that uses different learning rates for the two adapter matrices. This allows the model to learn features more efficiently during finetuning. In their experiments, LoRA+ led to 1-2% better performance and up to 2x faster finetuning, compared to the original LoRA approach, without any increase in computational cost."

Abstract
Transformers are a class of autoregressive deep learning ar chitectures which have recently achieved state-of-the-
art performance in various vision, language, and robotics t asks. We revisit the problem of Kalman Filtering in linear
dynamical systems and show that Transformers can approxima te the Kalman Filter in a strong sense. Speciﬁcally,
for any observable LTI system we construct an explicit causa lly-masked Transformer which implements the Kalman
Filter, up to a small additive error which is bounded uniform ly in time; we call our construction the Transformer
Filter. Our construction is based on a two-step reduction. W e ﬁrst show that a softmax self-attention block can
exactly represent a Nadaraya–Watson kernel smoothing esti mator with a Gaussian kernel. We then show that this
estimator closely approximates the Kalman Filter. We also i nvestigate how the Transformer Filter can be used for
measurement-feedback control and prove that the resulting nonlinear controllers closely approximate the performanc e
of standard optimal control policies such as the LQG control ler.
1 Introduction
Transformers are a class of autoregressive deep learning ar chitectures designed for various sequence modelling tasks ,
ﬁrst introduced in [8]. Transformers have quickly emerged a s the best performing class of deep learning models across
a variety of challenging domains, including computer visio n, natural language processing, and robotics, and have also
been studied in the context of reinforcement learning and de cision-making (e.g. [1, 4, 5, 9]). While the empirical
successes of Transformers are exciting, we still lack a form al theory that explains what Transformers can do and why
they work. In this paper, we study how Transformers can be use d for ﬁltering and control in linear dynamical systems.
We ask perhaps the most basic question one could ask: can a Tra nsformer be used for Kalman Filtering? The Kalman
Filter is foundational in optimal control and a crucial comp onent of the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller.
If Transformers were unable to perform Kalman Filtering, th en the use of Transformers in signal processing and
control would be suspect; conversely, establishing that Tr ansformers can indeed perform Kalman Filtering is a crucial
ﬁrst step towards establishing the viability of Transforme rs in these domains.
In the mathematical theory of deep learning, three question s naturally arise. First, which functions can a given
deep learning architecture represent? Second, when traine d on data, what function does the deep learning system
actually learn? Lastly, how well does this learned function generalize on new data? We focus on the ﬁrst of these
questions and leave the other two for future work. Speciﬁcal ly, we investigate the following questions. First, is the
nonlinear structure of a Transformer compatible with a Kalm an Filter at all? This is not obvious; it is possible a priori
that no matter how a Transformer is implemented, the softmax nonlinearity in the self-attention block will cause the
state estimates of the Transformer and the Kalman Filter to d iverge over time. Second, if it is possible to represent the
Kalman Filter with a Transformer, what would that Transform er look like? How should the states and observations be
represented within the Transformer? It is known that positional encoding improves the performance of Transformers
in some tasks - is it necessary for Kalman Filtering? How larg e must the Transformer must be, e.g., how large must
the embedding dimension be, and how many self-attention blo cks are required?
1.1 Key contributions
We construct an explicit Transformer which implements the K alman Filter, up to a small additive error; we call our
construction the Transformer Filter. Our construction is b ased on a two-step reduction. First, we show that a self-
attention block can exactly represent a Nadaraya–Watson ke rnel smoothing estimator with a Gaussin kernel. We
select a speciﬁc covariance in our Gaussian kernel with a sys tem-theoretic interpretation: it measures how closely a
1
previous state estimate matches the most recent state estim ate, where the measure of “closeness"" is the ℓ2distance
between the one-step Kalman Filter updates using each of the state estimates. The kernel takes as inputs nonlinear
embeddings of the previous state estimates and observation s; these embeddings have quadratic dependence on the
size of the underlying state-space model. In particular, if the state-space model has an n-dimensional state and p-
dimensional observations, the kernel we construct takes as input embeddings of dimension O((n+p)2). The second
step in our construction is to show that this kernel smoothin g algorithm approximates the Kalman Filter in a strong
sense. Speciﬁcally, for every ε >0, we show that by increasing a temperature parameter βin our kernel, we can
ensure that the sequence of state estimates generated by the Transformer Filter is ε-close to the sequence of state
estimates generated by the Kalman Filter. A noteworthy aspe ct of our construction is that it does not use any positional
embedding; permuting the history of state estimates and obs ervations has no effect on the state estimates generated in
subsequent timesteps.
We next investigate how the Transformer Filter can be incorp orated into a measurement-feedback control sys-
tem. A key technical challenge is to understand the closed-l oop dynamics that are induced by the Transformer Filter;
since the state-estimates produced by the Transformer Filt er are a nonlinear function of the observations, the resulti ng
closed-loop map is also nonlinear. This means that standard techniques for establishing stability of the system, such
as bounding the eigenvalues of the closed-loop map, cannot b e used. We show that the Transformer Filter can closely
approximate an LQG controller, in the following sense: for e veryε >0, we construct a controller using the Trans-
former Filter which generates a state sequence that is ε-close to the state sequence generated by the LQG controller .
A consequence of this result is that the controllers we const ruct are weakly stabilizing in the following sense; while
they may not drive the state all the way to zero, they are guara nteed to drive the state into a small ball centered at zero.
Our result also implies that the cost incurred by our new cont roller can be driven arbitrarily close to the optimal cost
achieved by the LQG controller. All of our approximation res ults also hold when the reference algorithm is taken to
be anH∞ﬁlter orH∞controller.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Filtering and Control
The ﬁrst problem we consider is Filtering in Linear Dynamical Systems . In this problem, we consider a partially
observed linear system
xt+1=Axt+wt, yt=Cxt+vt,
wherext∈Rnis an unknown state and yt∈Rpis a noisy linear observation of the state; the variables wtvtare
exogenous disturbances which perturb the state and observa tion. The state is initialized at time t= 0 to some ﬁxed
statex0. The task of ﬁltering is to sequentially estimate the state s equence given the observation sequence. We focus
on the strictly causal setting, where the ﬁltering algorith m estimates the state xtafter observing y0,...,y t−1. The
best-known algorithm for ﬁltering in linear dynamical syst ems is undoubtedly the Kalman Filter , which is the mean-
square-optimal linear ﬁlter when the disturbances are stoc hastic. More precisely, if {wt}t≥0and{vt}t≥0are assumed
to be independent, white noise processes, then the estimate /hatwidex⋆
tproduced by the Kalman Filter satisﬁes
/hatwidex⋆
t= inf
zE/bracketleftbig
/bardblz−xt/bardbl2/bracketrightbig
,
where the inﬁmum is taken over all linear functions z(y0,...yt)of the observations. In the special case where the
disturbances are Gaussian, the Kalman Filter estimate is al so a maximum likelihood estimate of the state conditioned
on the observations. The Kalman Filter has the following rec ursive form: the prediction of the next state given the
observations y0,...yt−1is
/hatwidex⋆
t= (A−LC)/hatwidex⋆
t−1+Lyt−1, (1)
whereLis a ﬁxed matrix called the Kalman gain and we initialize x⋆
0=x0. We also note that the H∞ﬁlter has an
identical recursive form to the Kalman Filter, except with a different gain matrix L[2].
The second problem we consider is Measurement-Feedback Control in Linear Dynamical Systems . In this problem,
we again consider a partially observed linear system, but th e system is now augmented to include a control input
ut∈Rm:
xt+1=Axt+But+wt, yt=Cxt+vt.
2
The goal of the controller is to select the control action utto regulate the state using only the observations y0,...,y t.
In the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) model, the disturb ances{wt}t≥0and{vt}t≥0are once again assumed to be
independent, white noise processes, and the control action s are selected to minimize the inﬁnite-horizon cost

.
It is known that in this case the optimal policy is to use the Ka lman Filter to produce a state estimate /hatwidex⋆
tand then to
pick the control actions as a linear function of the estimate [2]. The Kalman Filter estimate is adjusted to account for
the inﬂuence of the control input, so the LQG policy is
/hatwidex⋆
t= (A+BK−LC)/hatwidex⋆
t−1+Lyt−1, u t=K/hatwidex⋆
t, (2)
whereKis called the state-feedback matrix . Other measurement-feedback controllers of the general fo rm (2) include
theH∞measurement-feedback controller, which uses a different c hoice ofLandK[2].
We assume that the pair (A,C)is observable, and the pair (A,B)is controllable; we refer to [3] for background
on linear systems. We let /bardblA/bardbldenote the spectral norm of a matrix A. We make repeated use of the following facts.
Fact 1. LetA∈Rq×qbe any stable matrix, i.e., any matrix with spectral radius s trictly less than 1. There exist
matricesM,θ such that A=MθM−1and/bardblθ/bardbl<1.
Fact 2. Let(L,K)represent any stabilizing linear measurement-feedback co ntroller. The matrices A−LCand
A+BK are both stable.
2.2 Transformers and Softmax Self-Attention
A Transformer is a deep learning architecture which alterna tes between self-attention blocks and Multilayer Perceptr on
(MLP) blocks. In this paper we focus on Transformers with a si ngle self-attention block, followed by a single MLP
block; furthermore, we always assume that the weights of the MLP block are chosen so that the MLP block represents
the identity function. The interesting part of our construc tion hence lies in how we choose the parameters of the
self-attention block.
A general softmax self-attention block has the following fo rm. It takes as input a series of tokens q0,...,q Nand
a query token q, and outputs
F(q0,...qN;q) =/summationtextN
i=0exp(q⊤Aqi)Mqi/summationtextN
j=0exp(q⊤Aqj),
whereAandMare parameters of the Transformer; we refer to [7] for an exce llent overview of Transformers. In our
paper we consider causally masked Transformers, which means that we think of the tokens as bein g indexed by time
and at each timestep twe drop all the tokens which have not yet been observed, only k eeping those up until time t. In
our results, we also drop all but the last Hobserved tokens, to obtain the self-attention block
F(qt−H+1,...qt;q) =/summationtextt
i=t−H+1exp(q⊤Aqi)Mqi/summationtextt
j=t−H+1exp(q⊤Aqj).
In our construction, the tokens qiare embeddings of the the i-th state-estimate and the i-th observation, i.e., qi=
φ(/hatwidexi,yi),whereφis a nonlinear embedding map. The Transformer Filter genera tes state estimates recursively; it
takes as input the past Hstate estimates and observations (/hatwidext−H,yt−H),...,(/hatwidext−1,yt−1), embeds them as tokens
using the map φ, feeds these tokens qt−H+1,...,q tinto the self-attention block, and outputs a new state estim ate
/hatwidext=F(qt−H+1,...qt;q), where we take q=qt. We note that the Kalman Filter has a similar recursive form; it uses
the previous estimate /hatwidext−1and the previous observation yt−1to generate the new estimate /hatwidext. In fact, in the special
case when H= 1, the Transformer Filter exactly coincides with the Kalman F ilter.
3 Nadaraya–Watson Kernel Smoothing via Softmax Self-Atten tion
Our ﬁrst result is that the class of Transformers we study is c apable of representing a Nadaraya–Watson estimator with
a Gaussian kernel. Intuitively, given data {zi}N
i=0and a query point z, a Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator outputs
3
a linear combination of the data, weighted by how close each d atapointziis toz, where the measure of “closeness""
is determined by a ﬁxed covariance matrix Σ. We refer to [6] for more background on kernel smoothing and t he
Nadaraya–Watson estimator.
Theorem 1. FixΣ∈Rd×dandW∈Rk×d. Suppose we are given z0,...,z N∈Rdandz∈Rd. Deﬁne the
Nadaraya–Watson estimator
F(z0,...zN;z) =/summationtextN
i=0exp(−(z−zi)⊤Σ(z−zi))Wzi/summationtextN
j=0exp(−(z−zj)⊤Σ(z−zj)). (3)
The function Fcan be represented by a softmax self-attention block of size O(d2H). In particular, there exists a
nonlinear embedding map φ:Rd→Rℓand matrices M∈Rk×ℓandA∈Rℓ×ℓsuch that
F(z0,...zN;z) =/summationtextN
i=0exp(q⊤Aqi)Mqi/summationtextN
j=0exp(q⊤Aqj),
where we deﬁne qi=φ(zi)andq=φ(z)and setℓ=/parenleftbign
2/parenrightbig
+n+1.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that the function f:Rd×Rd→Rgiven by
f(u,v) = exp( −(u−v)⊤Σ(u−v))
can be represented as
f(u,v) = exp( φ(u)⊤Aφ(v))
for some embedding map φand matrix Aof appropriate dimensions. Observe that
(u−v)⊤Σ(u−v) =n/summationdisplay
i,j=1Σi,j(uiuj−2uivj+vivj). (4)
Deﬁne
φ(u) =/bracketleftbig1u1... u nu1u1u1u2... u nun−1unun/bracketrightbig⊤.
It is easy to see that the set
S(u,v) ={φ(u)⊤Aφ(v)|A∈Rℓ×ℓ, A=A⊤}
represents all polynomials in (u1,...,u n,v1,...,v n)of degree at most four such that within each monomial, the
degree of the variables appearing in u(resp.v) is at most 2. In particular, there exists a choice of Asuch that
φ(u)⊤Aφ(v)is exactly the polynomial (4). We take the matrix Mto be the k×ℓmatrix which contains Was a
submatrix from columns 2 to n+1and is zero elsewhere; notice that Mφ(u) =Wu for allu∈Rd.
4 Filtering
We ask:
Can a Transformer implement the Kalman Filter?
Naturally, since a Transformer is a complicated nonlinear f unction of its inputs, it is too much to expect a Transformer
to exactly represent a Kalman Filter. We instead ask the foll owing approximation-theoretic question: for any ε >0,
does there exist a Transformer which generates state estima tes which are ε-close to the state estimates generated by
the Kalman Filter, uniformly in time?
We consider the one-layer Transformer whose MLP block is the identity function and whose self-attention block
takes as input embeddings of the past Hstate estimates and observations
/bracketleftbigg
/hatwidext−H
yt−H/bracketrightbigg
,...,/bracketleftbigg

and outputs the estimate
/hatwidext=t/summationdisplay
i=t−H+1αi,t/tildewidexi,
where we deﬁne
αi,t=exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexi−/tildewidext/bardbl2)/summationtextt
j=t−H+1exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexj−/tildewidext/bardbl2),/tildewidexi=/bracketleftbigA−LC L/bracketrightbig/bracketleftbigg/hatwidexi−1
yi−1/bracketrightbigg
,
for allt≥1and set/hatwidex0,/tildewidex0=x0. We adopt the convention that /hatwidexi,yi= 0 for alli <0. We call this ﬁlter the
Transformer Filter; it is easy to check that this ﬁlter is a sp ecial case of the Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator (3)
and hence by Theorem 1 can be represented by a Transformer. Th e variables /tildewidexihave the following interpretation; they
are the estimates that would be generated by the Kalman Filte r recursion (1) if the previous Kalman Filter estimate
/hatwidex⋆
i−1were replaced by the Transformer estimate /hatwidexi−1. In that sense, the variables /tildewidexiinterpolate between the Kalman
Filter and the Transformer Filter. We prove:
Theorem 2. For each ε >0, there exists a β >0such that the state estimates {/hatwidext}t≥0generated by the Transformer
Filter satisfy
/bardbl/hatwidext−/hatwidex⋆
t/bardbl ≤ε
at all times t≥0, where{/hatwidex⋆
t}t≥0are the state-estimates generated by the Kalman Filter (1). In particular, it sufﬁces
to take
β≥H2κ2
2e(1−/bardblθ/bardbl)2ε2,
whereM,θ aren×nmatrices such that A−LC=MθM−1and/bardblθ/bardbl<1, and we deﬁne κ=/bardblM/bardbl/bardblM−1/bardbl.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that for all ε1>0, there exists a βsuch that
/bardbl/hatwidext−/tildewidext/bardbl ≤ε1
at all times t≥0. Fix any ε1>0and anyt≥1. Notice that for each i∈ {t−H+1,...,t}, the following inequality
holds:
αi,t<exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexi−/tildewidext/bardbl2).
This is because
t/summationdisplay
j=t−H+1exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexj−/tildewidext/bardbl2)>1.
It follows that

γ≥0exp(−βγ2)γ,
where we used the fact that/summationtextt
i=t−H+1αi,t= 1in the ﬁrst step. It is easy to check that the function f(γ) =He−βγ2γ
is strictly increasing in the interval (0,(2β)−1/2)and strictly decreasing in the interval ((2β)−1/2,∞)and hence takes
its maximum value of He−1/2(2β)−1/2atγ= (2β)−1/2. It follows that /bardbl/hatwidext−/tildewidext/bardbl ≤ε1as long as β≥H2

the preceding argument, this sufﬁces to ensure that /bardbl/hatwidext−/tildewidext/bardbl ≤ε1for allt≥0. We see that

t/bardbl
≤ /bardbl/hatwidext−/tildewidext/bardbl+/bardbl(A−LC)(/hatwidext−1−/hatwidex⋆
t−1)/bardbl
Proceeding recursively, we obtain the bound
/bardbl/hatwidext−/hatwidex⋆

Using the fact that A−LC=MθM−1with/bardblM/bardbl/bardblM−1/bardbl=κand/bardblθ/bardbl<1, we see that
/bardbl/hatwidext−/hatwidex⋆

We note that the only property of the gain matrix Lwe used is that A−LCis stable; since this property also holds
for theH∞-optimal choice of L, our proof also shows that a Transformer can approximate an H∞-optimal ﬁlter.
5 Control
We ask:
Can the Transformer Filter be used in place of the Kalman Filt er in the LQG controller?
Since the Transformer Filter only represents the Kalman Fil ter approximately, we cannot hope to implement the LQG
controller exactly. Instead, we ask if the closed-loop dyna mics generated by the Transformer can closely approximate
the closed-loop dynamics generated by the LQG controller in the following sense: for any ε >0, can we guarantee
that the states generated by the Transformer are ε-close to the states generated by the Transformer, uniforml y in time?
We emphasize that this is far from obvious, and in particular does not follow directly from Theorem 2. Even if the
state-estimates generated by the Transformer Filter are cl ose to those generated by the Kalman Filter, it does not
automatically follow that the resulting control policies w ill generate similar state trajectories. This is because an y
difference in state estimates will lead to a difference in th e control actions, which in turn affects future states, futu re
observations, and so on; in effect, minute deviations betwe en the two state estimates could be ampliﬁed over time,
leading to diverging trajectories. In order to show that thi s scenario does not occur, we need to analyze the stability of
the closed-loop map induced by the Transformer Filter. This is challenging, because this map is nonlinear, and hence
we cannot use standard techniques from linear systems theor y.
We consider the controller given by
ut=K/hatwidext
where we set
/hatwidext=t/summationdisplay
i=t−H+1αi,t/tildewidexi,
6
and we deﬁne
αi,t=exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexi−/tildewidext/bardbl2)/summationtextt
j=t−H+1exp(−β/bardbl/tildewidexj−/tildewidext/bardbl2),/tildewidexi= (A+BK−LC)/hatwidexi−1+Lyi−1.
We initialize the state of the system driven by the Transform er system to match the state of the system driven by the
LQG policy (i.e., x0=x⋆
0) and similarly initialize the state estimates to be the same (/hatwidex0=/hatwidex⋆
0). We also initialize
/tildewidex0=/hatwidex0. We prove:
Theorem 3. For each ε >0, there exists a β >0such that the states {xt}t≥0generated by the Transformer Filter
satisfy
/bardblxt−x⋆
t/bardbl ≤ε
at all times t≥0, where{x⋆
t}t≥0are the states generated by the optimal LQG control policy (2 ). In particular, it
sufﬁces to take
β≥CH2κ2
2e(1−/bardblΘ/bardbl)2ε2
where we deﬁne
C= 2/bardblBK/bardbl2+2/bardblA+BK−LC/bardbl2, κ =/bardblM/bardbl/bardblM−1/bardbl,
andM,Θare4n×4nmatrices such that A=MΘM−1and/bardblΘ/bardbl<1, and we deﬁne
A=
A BK 0 0
LC A+BK−LC0 0
0 0 A BK
0 0 LC A+BK−LC
.
Before we turn to the proof, we note an interesting consequen ce of this result: the controller induced by the
Transformer Filter is weakly stabilizing in the sense that no matter how x0is chosen, if the disturbances are zero then
the states generated by the controller will eventually be co nﬁned to a ball of radius εcentered at the origin. This
follows from the fact that the LQG controller is stabilizing (i.e., it drives the state to zero in the absence of noise).
Proof. An identical argument to that appearing in the proof of Theor em 2 establishes that for all ε1>0, choosing
β≥H2
2eε2

guarantees that
/bardbl/hatwidext−/tildewidext/bardbl ≤ε1

loop system is nonlinear. In effect, we have pushed all of the nonlinearity and memory in the closed-loop system into
the variables {ηt}t≥0.

since this property also holds for the H∞-optimal choice of LandK, our proof also shows that a Transformer can
approximate an H∞-optimal measurement-feedback controller.

","The paper investigates whether a Transformer model, a type of artificial intelligence algorithm, can learn to perform the same tasks as a Kalman filter , a widely used algorithm for state estimation and filtering. Kalman filters are commonly used in applications like navigation, control systems, and signal processing to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. The authors explore the connections between Transformers and Kalman filters, and whether Transformers can learn to represent the dynamics of linear systems in the same way that Kalman filters do. They provide both theoretical and empirical analyses to understand the representational power of Transformers and their ability to capture the same properties as Kalman filters. This research is important because it helps to understand the capabilities and limitations of Transformer models, and whether they can be used as a substitute for traditional algorithms like Kalman filters in certain applications. If Transformers can learn to perform the same tasks as Kalman filters, it could lead to new and more powerful techniques for state estimation, prediction, and control."

Abstract
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely-used parameter-efficient finetuning method for
large language models. LoRA saves memory by training only low rank perturbations to
selected weight matrices. In this work, we compare the performance of LoRA and full
finetuning on two target domains, programming and mathematics. We consider both the
instruction finetuning ( ≈100K prompt-response pairs) and continued pretraining ( ≈20B
unstructured tokens) data regimes. Our results show that, in the standard low-rank settings,
LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning. Nevertheless, LoRA better maintains the
base model’s performance on tasks outside the target domain. We show that LoRA mitigates
forgetting more than common regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout;
it also helps maintain more diverse generations. Finally, we show that full finetuning learns
perturbations with a rank that is 10-100 ×greater than typical LoRA configurations, possibly
explaining some of the reported gaps. We conclude by proposing best practices for finetuning
with LoRA.
1 Introduction
Finetuning large language models (LLMs) with billions of weights requires a non-trivial amount of GPU
memory. Parameter-efficient finetuning methods reduce the memory footprint during training by freezing a
pretrained LLM and only training a small number of additional parameters, often called adapters. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA; Hu et al. (2021)) trains adapters that are low-rank perturbations to selected weight
matrices.
LoRA is widely adopted for finetuning LLMs under hardware constraints, but the jury is still out on whether
it compromises performance compared to full finetuning. The two seminal methods papers on the topic,
which introduce LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and its more recent combination with model quantization (QLoRA;
Dettmers et al. (2024)), reported that LoRA performs better or equivalent to full finetuning. More empirical
work (Ghosh et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024b) reaches a similar conclusion; this sentiment is echoed in an array
of industry blog posts as well (e.g., Raschka (2023); Niederfahrenhorst et al. (2023)). At the same time, there
is evidence that LoRA underperforms full finetuning (Ivison et al., 2023; Zhuo et al., 2024), and the need to
improve upon LoRA has led to the development of enhanced LoRA variants (Hayou et al., 2024; Meng et al.,
2024; Li et al., 2023b; Shi et al., 2024) or alternative low-rank approximation methods (e.g Liu et al. (2024);
Zhao et al. (2024a)). To shed light on this ongoing debate, we ask: under which conditions does LoRA
approximate full finetuning accuracy on challenging target domains, such as code and math?
By training fewer parameters, LoRA is hypothesized to constrain the finetuned model from diverging
significantly from the base model (Sun et al., 2023; Du et al., 2024). This potential characteristic is
particularly helpful for LLM finetuning, a form of continual learning where specializing in new domains can
come at the expense of base model capabilities (Wang et al., 2024) (a phenomenon known its extreme form
1arXiv:2405.09673v2 [cs.LG] 20 Sep 2024
Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (08/2024)
as “catastrophic forgetting” McCloskey & Cohen (1989); French (1999)). To date, only a few studies have
examined forgetting in modern LLMs (Vu et al., 2022; Kleiman et al., 2023; Kalajdzievski, 2024). To address
this gap,we also ask: when performing continual learning on a new domain, to what extent does
LoRA mitigate forgetting of base model capabilities?
In this study, we compare LoRA and full finetuning for Llama-2-7B models across two challenging target
domains, code and mathematics. Within each domain, we explore two training regimes. The first regime is
continued pretraining , which involves training on billions of unlabeled domain-specific tokens, most commonly
via full finetuning; here we use the StarCoder-Python (Li et al., 2023a) and OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023)
datasets (Table 1). The second is instruction finetuning , the common scenario for LoRA involving question-
answer datasets with tens to hundreds of millions of tokens. Here, we use Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110K
(Wei et al., 2023) and MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2023).
We evaluate target-domain performance (henceforth, learning) via challenging coding and math benchmarks
(HumanEval; Chen et al. (2021), and GSM8K; Cobbe et al. (2021)). We evaluate source-domain forgetting
performance on language understanding, world knowledge, and common-sense reasoning tasks (Zellers et al.,
2019; Sakaguchi et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2018).
We find that with commonly used low-rank settings, LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning, while
typically requiring longer training (Sec. 4.1). In continued pretraining, the performance gap between full
finetuning and LoRA is not closed even with high ranks. In instruction finetuning, on the other hand, high
ranks can match full finetuning performance.
Despite LoRA’s limitations, we show that it consistently maintains better source-domain performance
compared to full finetuning (Sec. 4.2). Furthermore, we characterize the tradeoff between learning and
forgetting (Sec. 4.3). We then show that LoRA – even with higher rank – mitigates forgetting more
aggressively than classic regularization techniques that aim to prevent overfitting, such as dropout (Srivastava
et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2013), and weight decay (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Moreover, by analyzing the
generated solutions to HumanEval problems, we demonstrate that while full finetuning tends to produce a
limited set of solutions, LoRA produces a wider range of solutions more akin to those of the base model (Sun
et al., 2023; Du et al., 2024)
Why does LoRA underperform full finetuning? LoRA was originally motivated in part by the hypothesis that
finetuning results in low-rank perturbations to the base model’s weight matrix (Li et al., 2018; Aghajanyan
et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021). However, the tasks explored by these prior works are relatively easy for modern
LLMs, and certainly easier than the coding and math domains studied here. Thus, we perform a singular value
decomposition to show that full finetuning barely changes the spectrum of the base model’s weight matrices,
and yet the difference between the two (i.e. the perturbation) is high rank. The rank of the perturbation
grows as training progresses, with ranks 10-100 ×higher than typical LoRA configurations (Figure 6).
We conclude by proposing best practices for training models with LoRA. We find that LoRA is very sensitive
to hyperparameters, including learning rates, choice of target modules, ranks, and scaling factors; setting
these properly is a prerequisite to approach full finetuning performance.
To summarize, we contribute the following results:
•Full finetuning is more accurate and sample-efficient than LoRA in continued pretraining (CPT) for
code and math; in instruction finetuning (IFT), higher ranks can close most of the gaps (Sec.4.1).
•LoRA forgets less of the source domain (Sec. 4.2 and 4.3).
•LoRA forgets less than common regularization techniques; it also helps maintaining the diversity of
generations (Sec. 4.5).
•Full finetuning finds high rank weight perturbations (Sec. 4.6).
•A hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for LoRA, as well as practical recommendations (Sec. 4.7).

2 Background
LoRA involves freezing a pretrained weight matrix Wpretrained∈Rd×k, and learning only a low-rank pertur-
bation to it, denoted here as ∆, as follows:
Wfinetuned =Wpretrained + ∆
∆ =γrAB, A∈Rd×r, B∈Rr×k.
Most common implementations initialize A0∼N(0,1), B 0= 0and set the scalar γr=α/rwith a controllable
hyperparameter α. The user chooses which Wpretrained to adapt (“target modules”), the rank r<<d,k , and
the hyperparameter α. By doing so, only d×r+r×kparameters are trained per module instead of d×k,
which reduces the memory and FLOPS required for computing the gradient. As an example, applying a
r= 16LoRA adapter to a 7B weight matrix with d=k= 4096trains<1%of the original parameter count.
Appendix Sec. H lays out the approximate memory savings by LoRA during training.
LoRA’s introduction and first applications targeted only the WqandWvmatrices in the self-attention
module (Hu et al., 2021). Since then, it has become best practice to target all transformer modules
(Raschka, 2023; Dettmers et al., 2024), i.e., {W(l)

2021; Touvron et al., 2023).
3 Experimental Setup
We train on code and math datasets that have been shown to increase downstream performance. We motivate
the training datasets and evaluation benchmarks below. All training was done using the Databricks MosaicML
composer1,streaming2, and llm-foundry3repositories, as well as the HuggingFace peftlibrary.
3.1 Datasets for Continued Pretraining (CPT) and Instruction Finetuning (IFT)
Coding CPT - Starcoder-Python (Li et al., 2023a) This dataset consists of permissively licensed
repositories from GitHub, including Git commits, in 80+ programming languages. We chose the Python
subset and sub-sampled it to 20B tokens.
Math CPT - OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) This dataset contains 14.7B tokens derived from
mathematical web pages from Common Crawl, correctly formatted to preserve mathematical content such as
LaTeX equations.4To match with the StarCoder-Python dataset, we trained on up to 20B tokens, repeating
tokens beyond the first 14.7B. An analysis of this dataset shows that it contains a considerable amount of full
English sentences.5
Coding IFT - Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110k (Wei et al., 2023) This dataset contains 72.97M tokens
of programming questions and answers. It reproduces the “Evol-Instruct” dataset of WizardCoder (Luo et al.,

5Out of a random selection of 100K examples, a regex search shows that 75% of the examples contain LaTex. The data is
classified as 99.7% English and “overwhelmingly English” by the langdetect and fasttext tools.

2023b) by iteratively prompting an LLM (GPT-4) to increase the difficulty of a set of question-answer pairs
from Code Alpaca (Chaudhary, 2023).6
Math IFT - MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2023) This dataset was built by bootstrapping mathematical
word problems from the training sets of GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) by
rewriting the questions with variations using GPT-3.5. This dataset contains 395K question-answer pairs and
roughly 103M tokens.7
We quantify learning and forgetting via benchmarks reported on the Open LLM Leaderboard8for state of
the art open-source LLMs such as Llama (Touvron et al., 2023).
3.2 Measuring Learning with Coding and Math Benchmarks ( target domain evaluation)
Coding - HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) This benchmark contains 164 problems that involve generating a
Python program given a docstring and a function signature. A generation is considered correct if it passes all
supplied unit tests. We use the Code Generation LM Evaluation Harness (Ben Allal et al., 2022) configured to
output 50 generations per problem, and calculate “pass@1” with softmax temperature=0.2 and top_p=0.95
for 0-shot HumanEval.
Math - GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) This benchmark includes a collection of 8.5K grade-school math word
problems. We evaluate on the test split of GSM8K (1,319 samples) as implemented in the LM Evaluation
Harness (Gao et al., 2023), with default generation parameters (temperature=0, 5 few-shot, pass@1).
3.3 Forgetting Metrics ( source domain evaluation)
We use the following benchmarks to asses degradation of base model capabilities. HellaSwag (Zellers et al.,
2019) includes 70K problems that describe an event with multiple possible continuations. The task is to
pick the most plausible continuation, which requires making inferences about nuanced everyday situations.
WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2019) also assesses commonsense reasoning. It includes 44K problems with
sentences that require ambiguous pronoun resolution. ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018) consists of
7,787 grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions, and tests complex reasoning and understanding
of scientific concepts. These benchmarks involve multiple-choice questions that use the predicted logits for
calculating accuracy, and do not require specifying further generation hyperparameters. All forgetting metrics
were computed using the MosaicML Gauntlet evaluation harness (Dohmann, 2023).9
4 Results
4.1 Target-domain performance: LoRA at low ranks underperforms full finetuning
We compare LoRA and full finetuning after performing an exhaustive learning rate sweep for each method,
which we found to be crucial (Dettmers et al., 2024). We include learning rate sweep results in Figure S1.
We perform a sample-efficiency analysis – i.e., compute the learning metrics as a function of training samples
seen – for both LoRA and full finetuning. For IFT, we train separate models for 1,2,4,8, and 16epochs. For
CPT, we vary the number of training tokens ( 0.25,0.5,1,2,4,8,16,20billion), using individual learning rate
cooldown schedules. For each condition, we train one full finetuning model and three LoRA models with
ranksr= 16,64,256noting that most LoRA papers use a “low” rank of 8-64, (e.g., Dettmers et al. (2024);
Zhuo et al. (2024)). The LoRA models target all transformer modules and use α= 2r, as known to be best
practice (Raschka, 2023). For further details on experimental setup and hyperparameters, see Appendix Sec.

and (B)y-axis: HumanEval pass@1. In ( C) and (D)y-axis: GSM8K strict match. In all panels, “base model”
indicates Llama-2-7B without instruction finetuning. Note that 16 epochs are ≈1.16B and≈1.6B tokens, for
Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110K and MetaMathQA, respectively.
The results appear in Fig. 1. We first note that for both programming and math, IFT improves evaluation
scores much more than CPT, which is expected because the samples in each IFT dataset are more similar to
the evaluation problems (e.g., for code, IFT achieves maximum HumanEval of 0.497 vs. 0.263 for CPT).
ForCode CPT (Fig. 1A and Table S1), we identify a substantial gap between full finetuning and
LoRA that grows with more data. The best LoRA model, with rank r= 256, peaks at 20B tokens with
HumanEval=0.224, roughly matching full finetuning with 4B tokens (HumanEval=0.218). Full finetuning
reaches its peak HumanEval of 0.263 at 20B tokens. A clear ordering by rank emerges after the initial 1B
CPT tokens.

Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (08/2024)
ForCode IFT (Fig. 1B and Table S5), HumanEval accuracy is clearly ordered by rank from the very first
epoch. The more common r= 16andr= 64LoRA configurations have lower accuracy than full finetuning,
with HumanEval scores of 0.358 and 0.417 at epoch 4, respectively). With a high LoRA rank ( r= 256),
full finetuning performance can be matched (LoRA=0.498 in epoch 4, full finetuning=0.497 in epoch 8).
In Appendix Sec. F we perform a more sensitive HumanEval analysis, calculating pass@ kas a function of
k= 1,..., 256with a higher temperature of 0.8 for full finetuning and the LoRA models (at epoch 4). This
analysis shows that full finetuning is superior to r= 256fork<64, after which the two are equal.
Math CPT (Fig. 1C and S3) results closely echo those of code CPT. Consistent patterns in GSM8K
emerge at 4B tokens. Full finetuning opens a gap in GSM8K which widens with more data. Similarly,
LoRA performance is ordered by rank. The best LoRA ( r= 256) peaks at 16B tokens (GSM8K=0.203),
underperforming full finetuning at 4B tokens (GSM8K=0.224) and at its peak at 20B tokens (GSM8K=0.293).
LoRA closes much of the gap with full finetuning in the Math IFT (Fig. 1D and Table S7) dataset, while
remaining less sample efficient. Both methods substantially improve upon the base model; LoRA ( r= 256)
peaks at 8 epochs (GSM8K=0.634) while full finetuning achieves GSM8K=0.641 at 2 epochs and peaks at
4 epochs, with GSM8K=0.642.10Unlike the code IFT dataset, r= 64suffices to approach full finetuning
and achieve GSM8K=0.624 at epoch 4. We suggest that lower ranks are effective here because English
mathematics problems involve a smaller domain shift from the pretraining data as compared to coding ones.
In summary, in CPT, LoRA underperforms full finetuning across all configurations. In IFT, and especially in
code, high LoRA ranks are required to close the gap with full finetuning.
4.2 LoRA forgets less than full finetuning
Here, we investigate the extent of forgetting (defined in Sec. 3.2) as a function of training data in Fig. 2.
Overall, we observe that (1) IFT induces more forgetting than than CPT, (2) programming induces more
forgetting than math, and (3) forgetting tends to worsen with training duration. Most importantly, LoRA
forgets less than full finetuning, and the extent of forgetting is controlled by rank. In code – for both CPT
and IFT – full finetuning forgets substantially more than any LoRA configuration. In code CPT (Table
S2), at 20B tokens, full finetuning scores 0.545 versus 0.617 by LoRA r= 256. In code IFT (Table S6), full
finetuning scores 0.414 versus 0.509 by LoRA r= 64. In math – for both CPT and IFT – LoRA with r= 256
forgets nearly as much as full finetuning. In CPT (Table S4), LoRA scores 0.616 (20B tokens) versus 0.613 of
full finetuning (16B tokens). In IFT (Table S8), LoRA and full finetuing respectively degrade to 0.567 and
0.559 at epoch 16.
We note that the least forgetting occurs for the OpenWebMath dataset, which is dominated by English
sentences (see 3.1 for details).
4.3 The Learning-Forgetting Tradeoff
It is trivial that models that change less when finetuned to a new target domain will forget less of the source
domain. The nontrivial question is: do LoRA and full finetuning differ in how they trade off learning and
forgetting? Can LoRA achieve similar target domain performance but with diminished forgetting?
We form learning-forgetting Pareto curves by plotting the forgetting metric versus the learning metric for
each training duration (Fig. 3). As models train on more data, they learn more and forget more, traveling up
and left in this space. As we increase LoRA ranks, we find that the curves shift up and left as well, again,
learning more and forgetting more, doing so more consistently in IFT than CPT.
Each dataset presents a unique tradeoff pattern which makes it difficult to conclude whether LoRA and full
finetuning offer fundamentally different learning-forgetting tradeoffs. We will review each dataset next.
10We note that the original MetaMath paper reports a maximum accuracy of 0.665 when (fully) finetuning Llama-2-7B on the
MetaMathQA dataset. We attribute this to small differences in hyperparameters; they trained on 3 epochs with a batch size of
128 using the AdamW optimizer, a learning rate of 2e-5, a learning rate warmup of 3%.

Figure 2: LoRA forgets less than full finetuning. In all panels, the y-axis shows the average of
HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge and Winogrande for Llama-2-7B trained trained on: (A) StarCoder-Python (B)
Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110k (C) OpenWebMath (D) MetaMathQA.
For Code CPT, though the full finetuning curve reaches much higher values of HumanEval, it appears to
forget more for any given HumanEval value, which LoRA can reach if trained on more tokens. This pattern
does not hold for math CPT, where LoRA and full finetuning curves are roughly overlapping until full
finetuning shoots up (in 4B tokens) to achieve much higher GSM8K scores without increased forgetting. In
code IFT, LoRA r= 256offers comparable HumanEval accuracy while strictly forgetting less. Lower ranks
do not reach high values on HumanEval to compare to full finetuning. In math IFT, LoRA and full finetuning
seem to lie on adjacent learning-forgetting tradeoff curves, with full finetuning offering preferable tradeoffs.
With the caveats mentioned above, it seems that LoRA can offer preferable learning-forgetting tradeoffs for
code, while full finetuning can offer preferable tradeoffs for math. Moreover the choice of LoRA rank can
serve as a knob to navigate the learning-forgetting tradeoffs.

less (lower values on the y-axis) and forgets less (higher values on the x-axis). Each dot is a separate model,
with marker size corresponding to training duration (from 0.25-20 billion tokens for CPT, and 1-16 epochs
for IFT). Same data as Figures 1, 2.
4.4 For the Tülu-v2-mix dataset, LoRA is on par with full finetuning
So far, we analyzed how LoRA and full finetuning specialize in very specific domains. Often, code or math
problems appear as part of larger IFT data mixtures that include multi-turn conversations and a variety of
other NLP tasks, such as summarization, etc. (e.g. Wei et al. (2021)). We therefore finetuned LoRA and
full finetuning models on one such popular dataset, the Tülu-v2-mix (Ivison et al., 2023). The results are
presented in the Appendix (Sec. C and Table S9). In summary, we find that both LoRA and full finetuning
meaningfully improve upon the base model, and that LoRA, even with lower ranks, can match full finetuning
in chat quality as measured by Multi-Turn Benchmark (MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2024)), GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021), and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU; Hendrycks et al. (2020)). At longer
training durations (6 epochs), LoRA also forgets less.

Right panel: forgetting as measured by the average of HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge and WinoGrande scores.
The solid slateblue line shows that LoRA (r=256) learns as much as full finetuning, weight decay, and
attention dropout, while forgetting much less.
4.5 How strongly does LoRA constrain the finetuning process?
In this section, we analyze Llama-2-7B models trained on the Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110K dataset. We
first compare the learning-forgetting tradeoffs between LoRA and classic regularization techniques, and then
analyze the diversity of the generated text.
LoRA forgets less than attention dropout and weight decay We compare LoRA ( r= 16,256,
training all modules) to weight decay (Goodfellow et al., 2016) with values 5e−5,1e−4and attention dropout
(Srivastava et al., 2014) with values 0.05,0.1. Both regularization techniques appear to learn and forget as
much as full finetuning, except that weight decay starts to generally deteriorate at longer training durations
(epochs 8 and 16). LoRA, with the common r= 16, learns less and forgets less than all other models. LoRA
r= 256, on the other hand, learns as much as the other methods while forgetting less.
LoRA helps maintain diversity of token generations. We scrutinize the generated solution strings
for HumanEval problems. We calculate the unique number of output strings out of 50 generations (for base
model, full finetuning, and LoRA) serving as a coarse proxy for predictive diversity. In Figure 5 we separately
show the results for correct and incorrect answers. As in the reinforcement learning from human feedback
literature (Du et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023), we find that full finetuning results in fewer unique generations
(“distribution collapse”) compared to the base model, for both pass and fail generations, with LoRA in
between the two. The above works also suggest that LoRA could even substitute a common Kullback-Leibler
divergence term that keeps the probabilities of the generated text similar between the finetuned and base
model. We reiterate that exact string matching between generations is not a sensitive metric of predictive
diversity, as generations can slightly vary in format and remain functionally identical.
4.6 Full finetuning on code and math does not learn low-rank perturbations
In this section, we seek to study whether we should expect low-rank training to be a good approximation
to full finetuning, and if so, what is the necessary rank. Recall that full finetuning can be written as
Wfinetuned =Wpretrained + ∆; here we compute the Singular Value Decomposition of all three terms in the
equation. We focus on continued pretraining for code, where there are drastic differences between LoRA and
full finetuning. We analyze checkpoints obtained at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 billion training tokens.

Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (08/2024)
Figure 5: LoRA maintains output token diversity relative to full finetuning.
First, in Figure S7 we present results for the Wqprojection at layer 26 of Llama-2-7B (with dimensions
d×d,d= 4096). We show that the spectrum of the finetuned weight matrix is very similar to that of the
base weight matrix, both decaying slowly and requiring keeping ≈50%of singular vectors ( ≈2000/4096) to
explain 90% of the variance in the weight matrix. Critically, the difference ∆also has a similar spectrum to
the finetuned and base weight matrices (up to a multiplicative scaling). These results are in line with the
analysis in Zeng & Lee (2024) showing that any transformer model can be well approximated with r=d/2.
Additionally, we suggest that there is nothing extraordinary about the full finetuning spectra; similar spectra
can be achieved by adding low-magnitude Gaussian i.i.d noise to a weight matrix (Fig. S8).
Next, we ask when during training does the perturbation become high rank, and whether it meaningfully
varies between module types and layers. We estimate the rank needed to explain 90% of the variance in the
matrix. The results appear in Figure 6. We find that: (1) The earliest checkpoint at 0.25B CPT tokens
exhibits ∆matrices with a rank that is 10−100×larger than typical LoRA ranks; (2) the rank of ∆increases
when trained on more data; (3) MLP modules have higher ranks compared to attention modules; (4) first
and last layers seem to be lower rank compared to middle layers.
4.7 Hyperparameter sensitivity analyses for LoRA
Our goal in this work was to optimally configure LoRA so that it has the best chances of matching full
finetuning. This is nontrivial, as LoRA has a large number of hyperparameters to choose from: target
modules, rank, scaling factors, and learning rates. We turn to analyze the importance of each, and provide
some practical recommendations.
First, we found that the choice α= 2ris crucial for high ranks. Most common packages, e.g. HuggingFace’s
peft,11scale the LoRA matrices by α/r, effectively scaling down higher ranks (see also Kalajdzievski (2023)).
One might think that high learning rate values may compensate for fixed low α’s, but doing so creates

Abstract
We present an outcome-driven fine-tuning framework that enhances the forecasting capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) without relying on human-curated reasoning samples. Our method leverages
model self-play to generate pairs of diverse reasoning trajectories and probabilistic forecasts for a set
of diverse questions that resolve after the models’ knowledge cutoff date. We then rank pairs of these
reasoning traces by their distance to the actual outcomes before fine-tuning the model via Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). On a separate test set, our approach increases prediction accuracy of Phi-4 14B
and DeepSeek-R1 14B by between 7–10% over a base model and a DPO fine-tuned control model with
randomized labels, bringing them on par with forecasting capabilities of much larger frontier models like
GPT-4o.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of areas, often
approaching or exceeding human performance. One area where human performance has not yet been surpassed
is judgemental forecasting [ 1], where probabilistic forecasts are assigned to future events. Successful forecasts
by top-performing human forecasters include substantial reasoning about facts of the world, various trends,
and competing pieces of evidence [ 2], making it a great place to study model reasoning capabilities in a messy
real-world environment.
Moreover, forecasting is a central task in decision-making across sectors as diverse as finance, policy, and
law. It is central to inform resource allocation, manage risks, and plan organizational decisions. Modern
LLMs have already been shown to conduct financial analysis [ 3], evaluate the impact of events on time
series [4], and improve climate policy decision-making [ 5]. This makes improving LLMs’ forecasting abilities
potentially impactful and wide-ranging.

Notes:This chart outlines the stages of our method.
There has been some work explicitly looking to apply and boost the forecasting capabilities of LLMs.
Such work has relied on aggregation [ 6], retrieval of news as well as fine-tuning [ 7], and ranked-based context
retrieval [ 8], among other approaches [ 9]. While most of these systems improve performance to varying
degrees, many share a common methodological limitation: They are frequently reliant on human-curated data
such as up-to-date crowd forecasts or output curation, and often fail to have the models learn from resolved
outcomes. Human outputs are slow and costly to procure, making it difficult to have models continually learn
from them and improve.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to improving LLM forecasting performance that sidesteps the
use of human inputs above and beyond real-world resolutions and enables the model to directly learn from
1arXiv:2502.05253v1  [cs.CL]  7 Feb 2025
actual outcomes and self-play. Self-play, where models compete against themselves, has previously been used
in AlphaGo Zero to achieve superhuman performance [ 10], as well as more recent fine-tuning approaches like
Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN) [ 11]. By allowing the model to produce reasonings and forecasts by itself on a
large number of forecasting questions, this provides us with a large data set that we can then use for further
training. As such, we do not rely on human-written forecasting rationales or predictions and instead only use
model-generated reasoning, making this straightforwardly scalable.

Mean Brier Scores with SEM
Notes:The bar graph shows mean Brier scores with standard error of the mean (SEM) error bars. The
y-axis starts at 0.15. Lower Brier scores indicate higher accuracy.
Further, our approach uses Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) [ 12], a reward-free method entirely
bypassing the need for a separate reward model, to instead learn a reward signal from sets of ranked
reasoning pairs [ 13] drawn from the self-play outputs. This allows DPO to capitalize on relative rankings
between forecasts, enabling the model to learn from the entire set of generated samples without the need for
manual curation. Even when forecasts are individually suboptimal, DPO trains the model to discern subtle
differences in quality and systematically correct biases through pairwise comparisons. By contrast, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on human-curated examples and treats selected forecasts as fully correct, which can
lead to the discarding of potentially valuable information; DPO overcomes this limitation by learning from
all samples, thereby enhancing the robustness and efficiency of the fine-tuning process.
Our work follows up on recent advances made by DeepSeek’s release of R1 [ 14], which demonstrated the
power of reinforcement learning in deterministic contexts like mathematics and coding. We move the focus
to real-world forecasting, which is inherently noisy and relies on calibrated predictions rather than simple
binary correctness. This requires our models to learn from noisy probabilistic outcomes, which, if successful,
promises widespread applicability.
To achieve this, we draw on a large dataset of resolved prediction market questions from Polymarket,
where the model—restricted to a historical cutoff date—generates multiple reasoning traces and probabilistic
forecasts through self-play. We then rank these pairs of rationales based on their proximity to the resolved
outcome (for instance, ranking a 5% prediction higher than a 10% prediction if the event resolved to ""No"")
before fine-tuning our model on them and testing the model on a separate test set. This ensures that the
model does not simply learn whether a forecast predicted that an event would or would not occur, but instead
enables it to draw directly from the full set of forecasts needed for a well-calibrated forecasting model (see
Figure 1).
Our results on a temporally held-out test set of questions resolving after December 25, 2024 show that
2
for both of the models that we employed our method on, Phi-4 14B [ 15] and DeepSeek-R1 14B [ 14], we
find accuracy improvements of between 7–10% over the base versions of these models as well as the same
models fine-tuned with randomized outcome labels as a control, see Figure 2. Comparing not only to the
base model but also to randomized-label fine-tuned controls allows us to more rigorously tease out the effect
of outcome-based learning versus exposure to additional information. This shows that our method improves
model forecasting performance, underscoring the potential of drawing on self-play reasoning data in improving
probabilistic reasoning and prediction accuracy. Strikingly, our fine-tune of both models are also on par with
the performance of the much larger GPT-4o [16].
2 Method
Our approach consists of six main steps: 2.1) Collection and preprocessing of forecasting data, 2.2) News
collection, 2.3) Synthetic training data generation through base model self-play, 2.4) Resolution-driven
re-ranking, 2.5) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning, and 2.6) Forecasting test-set questions.
For this pipeline, we used two models for self-play and for the final forecasting process: Phi-4 [ 15] and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B [ 14]. Both models are small (at 14B parameters) but have shown strong
performance on general science and coding benchmarks, sometimes rivalling GPT-4o [ 17,18,14]. DeepSeek-
R1-Distill-Qwen-14B is a distilled model derived from Gwen2.5-14B [ 19] fine-tuned with the reasoning patterns
from DeepSeek-R1 [ 14]. Throughout this paper, we refer to these models as Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B
respectively.
2.1 Data
We collected a total of 12,100 binary outcome forecasting questions from the prediction market Polymarket.
We excluded all outcomes with ambiguous resolutions and partitioned the data as follows: our training set
included 9,800 questions that all resolved between July 1 and December 15, 2024, and our test set included
2,300 questions that all resolved between December 25, 2024 and January 23, 2025. We also collected the
final outcomes for all questions, recording as ‘0’ all outcomes that did not happen and as ‘1’ all outcomes
that did happen. See Table 1 for example questions.
Table 1: Example Questions with Outcomes
Question Outcome
Will Sam Altman attend presidential inauguration? 1
FTX doesn’t start payouts in 2024? 1
Will Modi win reelection? 1
Will Sebastian Korda reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open? 0
Pershing Square IPO in 2024? 0
Notes:Table 1 shows a set of questions in the test set as well as their outcomes, with 0 indicating a
negative resolution and 1 a positive resolution.
To evaluate the accuracy of our probabilistic forecasts in this paper, we calculate Brier scores. For each
forecasting question with a predicted probability piand an actual outcome oi∈{0,1}, the Brier score is
defined as
BS=1
N/summationdisplay
(pi−oi)2,
where Nis the total number of forecasting questions. A lower Brier score indicates higher forecasting
accuracy.

2.2 News Collection
We collected news via the NewsCatcher API 14 days prior to question resolution. Our approach was drawn
from [7] in that we generated search queries via GPT-4o and then integrated external news retrieval services
like Newscatcher to aggregate and process the output. These news articles were then used as further input in
Sections 2.3 and 2.6.
2.3 Model Self-Play Data Generation
We then instructed the base models to provide reasoning and a final probabilistic forecast for each question.
For Phi-4 14B, we employed a scratchpad prompt [ 20], while we used a zero-shot prompt for DeepSeek-R1
14B as <think> tags are already present in the model output generation. The prompt included a summary
of news from Section 2.2 along with the appropriate scratchpad or zero-shot prompt depending on the
model. We ran all queries with a temperature of 1. In total, we generated a pair of reasoning traces for
each question [ 21]. We first generated a single reasoning and then re-ran this process up to four times to
arrive at a second, non-identical forecast. If all subsequent predictions were identical, we removed the full
set of forecasts. Overall, we obtained 18,854 reasoning traces for the 9,427 forecasting questions that had
non-constant forecasts.
2.4 Resolution-Driven Re-Ranking
For each question, we paired up reasoning–outcome pairs and ranked them based on the proximity of the
probabilistic forecast (ranging from 0% to 100%) to the ground truth (0 or 1). Formally, for each question
with ground truth o∈{0,1}, let the probabilistic forecasts from two reasoning traces be denoted by p1and
p2(with pi∈[0,1]). We then define a ranking metric as
r(p, o) =|p−o|,
which measures the absolute difference between the forecast and the actual outcome. For example, if a
pair consists of reasonings with 4% and 8% predictions respectively — i.e. p1= 0.04andp2= 0.08— with a
ground truth of 0, then
r(0.04,0) = 0 .04and r(0.08,0) = 0 .08.
Since 0.04<0.08, the reasoning trace resulting in the 4% prediction is ranked above that of the reasoning
resulting in the 8% forecast. Notably, the squared error metric of the Brier score naturally mitigates
overconfidence by penalizing large deviations more heavily. Pairs that resulted in identical forecasts (i.e.
p1=p2) were removed prior to this stage. In total, we used the full set of 18,854 reasoning traces for the
9,427 forecasting questions for our re-ranking.
Moreover, to control for the possibility that information provided via the news aggregation at this step
might influence the rankings, we also fine-tuned a second set of models via the same process, but with the
ranking of labels randomised. These control models allow us to test whether the learning is attributable to
the models learning from the higher-accuracy forecasting rationales.
2.5 Direct Preference Optimization Fine-Tuning
We then fine-tuned Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B using the preference pairs from Section 2.3. We use Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to optimise model outputs against self-play derived and outcome-driven
preferences without the need to train a separate reward model. The DPO loss was minimised using a LoRA
adapter (rank=16, alpha=32, dropout=0.05, target_modules=""all-linear"", no bias) on top of the base model,
which was held in 4-bit quantisation, using a batch size of 2 (with 4 gradient accumulation steps) and gradient
checkpointing enabled. Training leveraged the AdamW optimiser with a linear learning rate scheduler (5e-5
base rate), beta=0.1, and BF16 mixed precision. We used 8 H100 GPUs for training. For Phi-4 14B, we found
a plateau at the fifth epoch, while this occurred at the fourth epoch for DeepSeek-R1 14B (see Figure 3).

2.6 Forecasting Test Set Questions
Finally, we test every model against a held-out test set of 2300 questions. Importantly, this test set begins 10
days after the final outcome in the training set, so our fine-tuned models have not been exposed to any news
that might inform outcomes in the test set.
We do this with three versions of each model: the original base model, the fine-tuned model with correct
outcomes for DPO ranking, and a control fine-tuned model with randomized outcomes for DPO ranking. This
allows us to distinguish between learning that happened due to exposure to new information (for example,
the news articles shared in prompts) versus learning by optimising for reasoning processes that lead to more
accurate forecasts.
To generate our final forecasts, we used the following prompts shown in Figure 4, derived from Halawi et
al. [7]. Our prompts drew on expert persona prompting [ 22], based on structured analytic techniques [ 23]
and Tetlock-style superforecasting [ 2], as well as more structured instructions, aiming to improve forecasting
accuracy over a naïve assistant prompt.

questions.
3 Results
For all results below, we call the fine-tuned model ‘Fine-Tune’, the base model ‘Base’, and the fine-tuned
model with randomized labels the ‘Control’. We find substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy for
both Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B fine-tunes, heavily outperforming the ignorance benchmark of a Brier
score of 0.25 (arrived at by predicting 50% on every question) and improving upon the base and control
models (see Figure 5).

For Phi-4 14B, the fine -tuned model achieved a mean Brier score of 0.200 (SD = 0.218; 95% CI [0.191,
0.209]), outperforming both the randomized -label control model (M = 0.214, SD = 0.186; 95% CI [0.206,
0.221]) and the base model (M = 0.221, SD = 0.189; 95% CI [0.214, 0.229]). Similarly, DeepSeek -R1 14B
attained a mean Brier score of 0.197 (SD = 0.218; 95% CI [0.188, 0.206]) after fine -tuning, surpassing both
its randomized -label control (M = 0.212, SD = 0.202; 95% CI [0.204, 0.220]) and base counterparts (M =
0.211, SD = 0.201; 95% CI [0.204, 0.220]).1
We conduct independent samples t-tests between the fine-tuned versions of the models and both the base and
control models, as well as the frontier model benchmark set by GPT-4o. We find that for both Phi-4 14B
and DeepSeek-R1 14B, the fine-tuned model is statistically significantly more accurate than both the base
and control models at p <0.05. This also holds after adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons via
1We hypothesise that one reason why the Phi-4 14B control model improves over the base, whereas there is no such effect for
DeepSeek-R1 14B, is that it is likely to learn significantly more from the news articles—even with randomised labels—because it
has a much earlier knowledge cut-off than DeepSeek-R1 14B.

the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [24]. This suggests that our method is able to robustly and consistently
improve forecasting performance, and that this performance increase is not due to the additional information
that fine-tuning on the reasoning traces brings.
However, we fail to observe statistically significant differences between the fine-tuned models and the frontier
model benchmark set by GPT-4o, p >0.7for both after adjustment. The fact that GPT-4o does not
outperform our small fine-tuning models shows that our method was effective in producing forecasting
performance on par with much larger frontier models. Our usage of 4-bit quantization, which typically leads
to small-to-medium performance reductions [ 25,26], further shows that our results are competitive even
under these constraints.

Comparing the distributions of accuracy scores across the questions for DeepSeek -R1 14B, we find that the
fine-tuned model had a Brier score above 0.5 (very low accuracy) on 8.52% of questions, slightly higher
than the base (7.48%) and control (7.61%) models. However, it also had a Brier score below 0.05 (very high
accuracy) on 32.78% of questions, compared to only 23.22% and 23.13% for the base and control models.
This indicates that while the fine-tuned model occasionally makes slightly more highly inaccurate forecasts,
it produces far more extremely accurate ones, more than compensating for the small uptick in large errors.
We replicate this pattern at a similar magnitude for Phi -4 14B, where the fine -tuned model has 8.87% of
forecasts above 0.5 but 35.7% below 0.05, compared to 7.26% and 21% for the base model and 6.43% and
20.39% for the control model, respectively.

4 Conclusion
Large language models can enhance their forecasting capabilities through self-play, generating reasoning
traces that enable outcome-based fine-tuning without relying on human-curated data. By pairing these
traces and ranking them by their proximity to actual outcomes, the models learn to refine their probabilistic
forecasts, outperforming base models and matching the performance of larger frontier models.

","Language models are getting better at predicting future events, but they usually need humans to teach them how to reason. This research shows a clever way around that limitation. Think of it like having two AI systems discuss different ways to predict something, like who might win an election. The AIs come up with various reasoning approaches and make their predictions. Later, when we know the actual result, we can see which AI's thinking process worked better. The winning approach gets used to teach the AI, similar to how we might learn from studying successful predictions in the past. The neat part is this all happens without human input guiding the reasoning process."

ABSTRACT
Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due
to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial
cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises
primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear
projections. When architectural modifications ( e.g., channel dimensions) are intro-
duced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes
continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs
and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce Tokenformer,
a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only
for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens
and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating
model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers
with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and
model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive
and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model
scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value
parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from
scratch while greatly reducing training costs. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/Haiyang-W/TokenFormer.git .
1 I NTRODUCTION
Designing a powerful neural network architecture is a long-standing goal in machine learning. Recent
developments in foundation models (FMs) have shown the potential of Transformers (Vaswani
et al., 2017) as a universal computational architecture. Thanks to their flexibility and scalability,
Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including natural
language processing (NLP) (Radford et al., 2018; Alec et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), visual
modeling (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), vision-language (Liu et al., 2023; Wang et al.,
2024), graph representation (Ying et al., 2021), and 3D vision (Wang et al., 2023a;b).
Transformers typically divide the computation required to process a single token into two distinct
parts: interactions with other input tokens ( token-token interaction) and computations involving
the model’s parameters ( token-parameter interaction). The attention mechanism (Vaswani et al.,
2017) facilitates token-token interactions, allowing modern general-purpose foundation models to
encode multi-modal data into a unified token sequence and effectively capture complex dependencies
among them (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023d). Conversely, token-parameter
computations rely heavily on linear projections (Dunford & Schwartz, 1988), where input tokens are
multiplied by a fixed set of parameters. This prescribed design limits scalability because increasing
the model size requires altering core architectural components, often necessitating retraining the
entire model from scratch. As models grow larger, this results in excessive resource consumption,
making it increasingly impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that enhances the
flexibility of token-parameter interactions, allowing for incremental scaling of model parameters and
effectively reusing previously trained models, thus significantly reducing the training burden.

previous smaller-scale models (represented by blue dots on the left). In this paper, we propose a novel
fully attention-based architecture that allows scaling model incrementally, thus greatly reducing the
overall cost of training large transformer architectures (depicted by red dots on the left). The right
panel delineates a comparison between conventional Transformer and our Tokenformer.
To achieve this objective, we introduce Tokenformer, a novel architecture that unifies the computations
of token-token and token-parameter interactions by entirely employing the attention mechanism. The
flexibility of our token-parameter attention layer, along with its ability to handle a variable number of
parameters, inherently enhances the model’s scalability, facilitating progressively efficient scaling.
As shown in Figure 1, we extend the Transformer architecture by preserving the computational
patterns between input tokens while reformulating all the linear projections using a cross-attention
mechanism. Specifically, to project features with input and output dimensions D1andD2, we employ
two sets of parameters, each comprising Nlearnable tokens with channel dimensions of D1andD2,
respectively. In this formulation, input tokens serve as queries, and model parameters as keys and
values. This flexibility renders our model’s parameters inherently scalable with variable N, allowing
for efficient expansion by continuously adding new key-value parameter pairs. Figure 1 shows that
our model can be scaled incrementally from 124M to 1.4B parameters, achieving performance similar
to training from scratch while saving more than half of the training cost.
The key contributions of this work are summarized as 1) As shown in Figure 1, we propose Token-
former, a fully attention-driven neural network that treats model parameters as tokens, maximizing
the flexibility of token-parameter computations while achieving competitive performance on standard
benchmarks across both language and vision domains. 2) Thanks to this design, our model can
be naturally scaled by progressively adding new key-value parameter pairs. Compared with the
train-from-scratch approach (Biderman et al., 2023; Kaplan et al., 2020), our method achieves nearly
the same performance while greatly reducing training costs.
We hope that the idea of tokenizing everything-whether it be data, parameter, or memory-and utilizing
attention mechanisms to build connections between them will introduce a unique perspective on
model architecture, inspiring innovative designs for future networks.
2 R ELATED WORK
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has emerged as a foundational architecture in deep learning
due to its versatile attention mechanism, enabling it to process any tokenized data and adapt to
numerous domains, including language modeling (Radford et al., 2018; Touvron et al., 2023), image
processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), multi-modal understanding (Liu et al., 2023; Wang et al.,
2024; 2023b; 2022), decision making (Chen et al., 2021b), graph learning (Yun et al., 2019), among
others. While the Transformer effectively handles interactions among input tokens with flexibility,
this property does not extend to computations involving model parameters, which are conducted
via prescribed linear projections. In this work, we seek to restructure token-parameter interactions
by developing a fully attention-based network that unifies both token-token and token-parameter
computations through attention mechanisms, thus further extending the network’s flexibility.
2
Large Scale Training has proven to be an effective approach for developing powerful foundation
models. As demonstrated by models like the GPT series (Radford et al., 2018; Alec et al., 2019;
Brown et al., 2020), simple architectures—when supported by larger training datasets and increased
model sizes (measured in parameters)—often outperform more complex algorithms. Scaling up data
is generally more cost-effective because it is independent of the model’s architecture and allows for
the continuous integration of new data through fine-tuning existing models (Kaplan et al., 2020). In
contrast, increasing the model size often incurs extremely high costs, as it alters architectural details
and usually requires retraining the entire dataset from scratch at each scaling step (Biderman et al.,
2023). This significantly raises the expenses for building progressively larger models in the industry.
Model Reusing. Previous methods for reusing models have typically involved initializing larger
models with pre-trained smaller models by duplicating (Chen et al., 2015; 2021a), stacking (Gong
et al., 2019), or combining (Wang et al., 2023c) model weights. While these approaches can be
effective, they often disturb the pre-established distribution of the smaller model, increasing the
risk of losing pre-trained knowledge and slowing convergence. In contrast, our model allows for
parameter scaling in a natural and seamless manner and preserves the integrity of the existing model.
3 M ETHODOLOGY
In this section, we first revisits the conventional attention mechanism in Section 3.1. Then, Section 3.2
introduces Tokenformer, a natively scalable architecture centered around a flexible token-parameter
attention layer. Finally, incremental model scaling of Tokenformer is detailed in Section 3.3.
3.1 P RELIMINARIES
Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) have established themselves as fundamental architectures
in deep learning, demonstrating outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks. The corner-
stone of their success is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to dynamically assess
the importance of each token, efficiently modeling complex dependencies among them.
Given a set of Tinput tokens X∈RT×dwith channel dimension d, the self-attention block first
derives input-dependent query Q, keyK, and value V, with three distinct linear projections as
Q=X·WQ, K =X·WK, V =X·WV, (1)
where the WQ, WK∈Rd×dkandWV∈Rd×dvare learnable weight matrices. The attention scores
are calculated by measuring the similarity between query and key vectors, followed by a softmax
function to obtain normalized weights. These scores are subsequently used to compute the output of
the scaled dot-product attention as,
Attention (Q, K, V ) =softmax [Q·K⊤
√
d]·V, (2)
where√
dis a scale factor for alleviating small gradients caused by softmax. Finally, the output is,
O=Xatt·WO, (3)
withXattbeing the attention output and WO∈Rdv×das the output projection matrix.
The above architectural design enables the model to flexibly manage interactions between tokens
of varying lengths, thereby allowing modern general models to concurrently process any form and
quantity of tokenized multi-modal data. This capability markedly enhances the development of
current AI domain and is fundamental to the success of transformer-based systems.
3.2 T OKENFORMER
Although transformers excel across various domains, their scalability is limited by high computational
overheads resulting from prescribed token-parameter interactions ( i.e., linear projections). As a result,
scaling strategies that adjust architectural components ( e.g., channel dimensions) typically require
retraining the entire model from the beginning, leading to inefficient use of computational resources.
To overcome this challenge, we propose Tokenformer, an architecture entirely based on attention
mechanisms. The central innovation of Tokenformer is token- Parameter attention (Pattention) layer,

cross-attention to manage interactions between input tokens and these parameter tokens. In this way,
the Pattention layer introduces an additional dimension—the number of parameter tokens—which
operates independently of the input and output channel dimensions. This decoupling enables input
data to dynamically interact with a variable number of parameters, providing the flexibility required
for incremental model scaling by reusing pre-trained models. Consequently, training larger models is
greatly accelerated while achieving performance on par with transformers trained from scratch.

Abstract
We propose a new long-context financial bench-
mark, FailSafeQA, designed to test the robust-
ness and context-awareness of LLMs against
six variations in human-interface interactions
in LLM-based query-answer systems within
finance. We concentrate on two case stud-
ies: Query Failure and Context Failure. In the
Query Failure scenario, we perturb the origi-
nal query to vary in domain expertise, complete-
ness, and linguistic accuracy. In the Context
Failure case, we simulate the uploads of de-
graded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We
employ the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained rat-
ing criteria to define and calculate Robustness,
Context Grounding, and Compliance scores for
24off-the-shelf models. The results suggest
that although some models excel at mitigating
input perturbations, they must balance robust
answering with the ability to refrain from hallu-
cinating. Notably, Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct,
recognized as the most compliant model, main-
tained strong baseline performance but encoun-
tered challenges in sustaining robust predic-
tions in 17% of test cases. On the other hand,
the most robust model, OpenAI o3-mini, fabri-
cated information in 41% of tested cases. The
results demonstrate that even high-performing
models have significant room for improvement
and highlight the role of FailSafeQA as a tool
for developing LLMs optimized for depend-
ability in financial applications. The dataset

1 Introduction
As the domains of financial services and Large
Language Models (LLMs) evolve at a rapid pace, it
comes as no surprise that finance, with its growing
need for new tools to uncover insights from data,
is increasingly adopting newly emerged LLMs for

Maple et al., 2023). These tools are later used with
significant impact in critical areas such as risk anal-
ysis, customer service, and operational decisions.
Despite warnings against over-reliance on LLM-
based systems in financial domains, people increas-
ingly depend on fully automated processes, driven
by trust in automation and the complexity of man-
aging vast amounts of data, such as long context
window financial reports (The Alan Turing Insti-
tute, 2023; Lee and See, 2004). Adding to these
concerns, recent research has shown, that models
are very sensitive to subtle changes in prompt for-
matting (Lu et al., 2022; Sclar et al., 2024). These
findings highlight the need for robust measures to
evaluate the risks associated with LLM dependence
and establish criteria for differentiating between
safe and unsafe models. Our approach extends be-
yond traditional financial benchmarks that focus
solely on LLMs performance under ideal condi-
tions (Xie et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Islam
et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023). We
have developed testing scenarios that more accu-
rately mirror real-world interactions between users
and query-answer systems (QA systems), ensuring
the tool maintains reliability even when queries de-
viate from typical patterns or involve topics beyond
the scope of the document. This approach is par-
ticularly crucial when the user has limited domain
expertise or knowledge of the document contents.
In response to these identified issues, we intro-
duce a new long context benchmark, FailSafeQA ,
which evaluates LLM resilience against varia-
tions in human input within the financial sector
caused by varying domain expertise, query incom-
pleteness, source irrelevance, and linguistic inac-
curacies. Research has demonstrated that LLMs
tend to overlook details or fabricate responses when
processing long-context texts (Hsieh et al., 2024;
Liu et al., 2024a). Consequently, we have cho-
sen long 10-K annual reports as our primary text

G roun d in gFigure 1: FailSafeQA: Robustness and Context Grounding Evaluation We evaluate the resilience of an LLM-
based QA system in two case studies: Query Failure andContext Failure . In the Query Failure scenario, we
perturb the original query into three variants: containing spelling errors (Misspelled Query), query-term form
(Incomplete Query), rephrased to exclude in-domain terminology (Out-of-Domain Query). In the Context Failure
case, we assume users can either fail to upload the document (Missing Context) , use degraged quality documents
due to OCR (OCRed Context) or upload a document irrelevant to the query (Irrelevant Context). Robustness
involves maintaining consistent model performance across perturbations (A)-(C) and (E), which preserve the

it on the ground truth and supporting citations, en-
suring that all answers can be sourced from a short,
relevant citation from the document. This approach
reduces the context length required during the judg-
ing phase, leading to quicker and more precise
evaluations of accuracy and comprehensiveness.
2 FailSafeQA Dataset
We have used publicly available annual reports of
U.S. publicly traded companies that filed with the
SEC’s EDGAR system during the years 1998, 1999,
2017, and 20182. We utilized 10-K filings, which
have been truncated to maintain complete para-
graphs while adhering to a context window that
does not exceed 25ktokens.
We employed the Meta Llama 3.1 405B model
(Dubey et al., 2024) for synthetic task genera-
tion and postprocessing steps ( generate ,rewrite ,
filter ) and LongCite-llama3.1-8b (Zhang et al.,
2024) for citation extraction ( extract ). Our semi-
automated data generation pipeline consisted of
2https://github.com/fengbinzhu/fintech-nlpthree phases: query generation, query perturbation
and context perturbation.
2.1 Query Generation
This phase focuses on producing and refining
queries generated from historical financial docu-
ments.
•(generate ) Generate multi-turn query and an-
swer pairs based on the truncated 10-K filings.
•(filter ) Identify the best standalone query
from each interaction.
•(rewrite ) Standardize the queries to make
each a clear, standalone question, intentionally
removing courteous expressions which have
been shown to affect results (Yin et al., 2024).
•(extract ) Extract and sanitize supporting ci-
tations from the full context for each query-
answer pair (refer to: Appendix A).
•(filter ) Retain only those data points for
which the provided citations adequately sup-
port the query response.

Figure 2: The Dataset Analysis of root verbs and their
direct objects from the first sentence of each normal-
ized query shows the top 20 verbs and their top five
direct objects1. This distribution can be used as a proxy
measure for the diversity of tasks in the dataset, with
83.0% related to question answering (QA) and 17.0%
involving text generation (TG).
Prompts used for generating and filtering
question-answer pairs can be found in Appendix C.
2.2 Query Perturbation
We used the Meta Llama 3.1 405B model to gener-
ate three types of query perturbations: Misspelled,
Incomplete, and Out-of-Domain. These cases rep-
resent three key failure factors: language accuracy,
search engine-style query phrasing, and lack of
domain expertise.
Misspellings We introduced controlled spelling
errors into financial queries using a rule-based ap-
proach. We generated four types of spelling errors:
Split Errors where combined words were separated
(e.g., ""newspaper"" to ""news paper""), Segment Er-
rors involving incorrect splitting or merging of
words (e.g., ""cat"" to ""c at"" or ""a cat"" to ""acat""),
Realword Errors substituting words with similar-
looking ones from a confusable list, and Com-
mon Typos sourced from Wikipedia’s List of Com-
mon Misspellings3by reversing correct to incorrect
spellings. These errors were distributed across the
dataset with split errors making up 31.7%, segment
errors 25.5%, realword substitutions 23.2%, and
common typos 19.6%.
3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:
Lists_of_common_misspellingsIncomplete Queries In this perturbation type,
our focus is on query incompleteness, drawing in-
spiration from the key-term-based queries typical
of search engines. Some of these queries resemble
the original by appearing as if words have been in-
tentionally omitted or rearranged. For instance, the
query ""What are the details of the capital conserva-
tion buffer mentioned in the K-10 filings?"" is trans-
formed into ""Details on the capital conservation
buffer mentioned?"" We created these incomplete
queries using Meta Llama 3.1 405B and manually
chose the most effective transformations.
Out-of-Domain The last category of query per-
turbation is inspired by the varying levels of ex-
pertise that users bring to a QA system. Ideally,
whether a query is created by an in-domain ex-
pert or someone out-of-domain, it should lead to
the same answer if the query is clear and targets
the same information. The specific wording used
should not impact the LLMs’ performance, as the
model should possess the necessary expertise to in-
terpret user intent accurately. For example, ""What
is the primary reason for the revenue increase in
2017?"" should be equivalent to ""Why did the com-
pany make more money in 2017?""
2.3 Context Perturbation
After exploring query perturbations, we now shift
our focus to transforming another part of the input
- the context, which in this case is the 10-K filing.
Missing Context We have simply omitted the
context from the final prompt while maintaining the
original prompt structure intended to introduce the
context. The expected LLM response is to refrain
from addressing the query directly and to notify the
user that the context is unavailable, possibly due to
reasons such as a file upload failure.
OCR Errors Simulation We have simulated Op-
tical Character Recognition (OCR) errors to re-
flect the typical contract execution process where a
clean, digital version of a contract is converted into
a paper document for signatures. This paper-based
version, necessitated by the legal requirement for
wet ink signatures (United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida, 2020), must
then be converted back into digital form through
scanning and OCR processing. This process intro-
duces various inaccuracies into the text.
For OCR error generation, we used Mathieu Tim-
merman (2023), which manipulates characters

based on probabilities derived from a normal distri-
bution and a customizable character set. We have
capped the upper limit on the character error prob-
ability at 10%. This value was empirically chosen
to reflect a balance between preserving readabil-
ity and mimicking realistic error occurrences. An
example of OCR-corrupted text is shown in Ap-
pendix B.
Irrelevant Context We have randomly paired
queries with irrelevant contexts and manually ver-
ified that these pairs were irrelevant to each other.
An ideal LLM should acknowledge when the con-
text is insufficient to answer the query, avoid fabri-
cating responses or using general knowledge, and
inform the user of the mismatch while suggesting
the need for relevant documentation.
See Figure 1 for a visual summary of the differ-
ent query and context perturbation scenarios dis-
cussed above.
2.4 Dataset Statistics
The final dataset consists of 220examples, each
originally containing between 4.1kand27ktokens
as processed by the GPT-4 tiktoken tokenizer4. No-
tably, a large proportion ( 93.64%) of examples fea-
ture a long context window, exceeding 16ktokens.
This count is based on the original context before
the injection of OCR errors, which can affect tok-
enization and increase the token count by approxi-
mately 1.3times.
Each data point includes a context paired with
five questions (the original query, three perturbed
variants, and an irrelevant query), an OCRed con-
text, the ground truth answer, and supporting cita-
tions from the full context.
Figure 2 shows the root verb and direct object of
the normalized query sentence for each data point,
which we interpret as a proxy for the variety of
instructions in the dataset5. The data generation
prompt specified an 80/20split between question
answering (QA) and text generation (TG) tasks.
After filtering and postprocessing, the final distri-
bution showed proportions of 83.0% and 17.0%,
respectively, indicating the influence of the initial
data generation requirements.

5We utilized SpaCy 3.7.6 with en_core_web_sm 3.7.1
model for verb-dobj analysis.3 Metrics
Answer Relevance Following Xu et al. (2024b),
we assign each answer a label from the set
{1,2,3,4,5,6}. We have designed the relevance
labeling criteria such that the values {4,5,6}de-
note answers that are relevant to the ground truth
and free from hallucinations, varying only in their
comprehensiveness. Answers with ratings {1,2,3}
either fail in terms of information accuracy or con-
tain irrelevant content. We will use the cutoff prop-
erty of the rating to define an auxiliary binary map-
ping that will determine a compliant answer in the
next section. Detailed rating criteria are presented
in subsection C.3.
Answer Compliance In our approach, a fail-safe
QA system should never mislead a user by provid-
ing fabricated or irrelevant information. We will
say that the answer is compliant if the relevance
score is at least 4. We define an auxiliary metric
c≥4that maps the relevance score into its binary
compliance score:
c≥4=(
1r≥4
0otherwise(1)
where r∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6}is the original relevance
label.
We note that the mapping has another useful
mathematical property: the Answer Relevance is
a categorical value, so one cannot directly take an
average of relevances. The Answer Compliance
maps categorical data into a binary classification,
where the average is well-defined. In subsequent
sections, whenever aggregate scores are mentioned
without specifying the metric, we will always refer
to an average of Answer Compliances, i.e., the ratio
of cases when the rating was at least 4.
3.1 LLM Robustness
Following HELM (Liang et al., 2023) we define
LLM’s Robustness (R) as:
R=1
nnX
i=1min
jc≥4(model (Tj(xi)), yi) (2)
where c≥4is the compliance mapping. In our
case input transformations T1, ...T kinclude identity
(our baseline), query perturbations producing Mis-
spelled, Incomplete and Out-of-Domain Queries,
and OCR context perturbation. Robust QA systems
are those that can provide a good answer despite
perturbations of query and context.
4
Figure 3: Answer Relevance Classes We evaluate two scenarios in our benchmark: when models should provide an answer
(ANSWER QUERY) and when they must decline to answer (REFUSE QUERY) due to lack of relevant context. Our findings
reveal that all the tested models are more adept at offering suitable answers than providing a justified refusal in situations where
the context lacks sufficient information. Among all models evaluated, Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct demonstrates the most effective
balance between these capabilities.
3.2 LLM Context Grounding
We define LLM’s Context Grounding (G) as an
average:
G=1
nj2X
j=1nX
i=1c≥4(model (Tj(xi), Y)) (3)
where c≥4is defined as above, and two input trans-
formations Tjare Missing Context and Irrelevant
Context. Intuitively, the QA system with a high
G score is able to detect cases where the problem
is unanswerable and refrain from producing poten-
tially misleading hallucinations.
In subsection C.3, we present the criteria used
for rating queries affected by Missing Context and
Irrelevant Context. We applied the same rules as for
other input perturbations: a rating of 4−6indicates
that the model met fail-safe requirements, mean-ing it refuses to answer while providing varying
degrees of feedback.
3.2.1 The Trade-off: LLM Compliance Score
Based on the observations detailed in our results,
we decided to introduce a new metric, LLM Com-
pliance Score ( LLMC β), that quantifies the trade-
off we identified between Robustness and Context
Grounding. This metric is inspired by the classic
precision-recall trade-off.
LLMC β= (1 + β2)·RG
(β2×G+R)(4)
where βis a positive real factor. Intuitively, Con-
text Grounding and Robustness measure the ability
of an LLM to refuse and answer the query, respec-
tively. For β <1, the compliance metric prioritizes
refusal to reduce the hallucination ratio.

Figure 4: Robustness and Compliance (Left) All models lose with respect to the baseline when input perturbations are applied.
The biggest drop is observed for Out-Of-Domain and OCR context perturbations. Among the 24tested models, OpenAI o3-mini
is the most robust. (Right) Reasoning models like OpenAI-o1/o3-mini and the DeepSeek-R1 series reach scores up to 0.59, while
Qwen models consistently surpass 0.60. Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct excels with the highest Context Grounding score of 0.80.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Models
We have evaluated a range of both open-source
LLMs and proprietary solutions that support con-
text length minimum 128k.
For open-sourced models we have chosen:
DeepSeek-R1 and its four distilled models (8B,
14B, 32B, 70B) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), three
Llama instruct models 3.x from Meta (3.1 8B, 3.1
70B, 3.3-70B) (Dubey et al., 2024), six Qwen 2.5
models including two 1M context window vari-
ants (7B, 14B, 32B, 72B, 7B-1M, 14B-1M) (Yang
et al., 2024), Nvidia’s Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF
(Wang et al., 2024), three Phi 3 series models (mini,
small, medium) (Abdin et al., 2024) and Writer’s
Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct.
For proprietary APIs we have selected five: GPT-
4o, OpenAI o1, OpenAI o3-mini (OpenAI, 2024;
OpenAI et al., 2024) Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp and
Gemini 1.5 Pro 002 (Team et al., 2024).
Whenever possible we used the same tempera-
ture0and max new tokens (or max completion
tokens) 2048 . All models ran locally used half-
precision inference with 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
4.2 Judging
We used the LLM-as-a-Judge method (Zheng et al.,
2023) with the generalist LLM, Qwen2.5-72B-
Instruct. In the evaluation stage, we provided the
judge LLM with the rating criteria, reference so-lution, relevant context citations, and the candi-
date answer. We used a temperature setting of 0,
a maximum of 256new tokens, and half-precision
inference.
We note that due to the positive correlation be-
tween increasing task context length and perfor-
mance drop (Hsieh et al., 2024), the judging task is
seen as much simpler than the predictions made dur-
ing the evaluation phase. We can think of citation-
based judging as an escape from the performance
degradation associated with long contexts and a
justification for utilizing a potentially weaker LLM
judge than the LLM being tested. Judging prompts
are shown in subsection C.4.
5 Results
In FailSafe QA benchmark, we assessed models in
two scenarios: providing a robust answer (Baseline
Query, Misspelled Query, Incomplete Query, Out-
of-Domain Query, OCRed Context) and declining
to answer when justifiable (Missing Context, Irrele-
vant Context). Figure 3 shows normalized Answer
Relevance classes for both cases. It appears all
models are better at delivering appropriate answers
than at justifiably refusing to answer when the con-
text is insufficient. Among the models, Palmyra-
Fin-128k-Instruct strikes the best balance in these
scenarios.
Robustness All models exhibited decreased per-
formance when measuring Robustness, which as-

(TG) than in question-answering (QA) tasks. (Right) Similar statement also holds true for Context Grounding - when a model is
asked to generate text (e.g., a blog post), it is more likely to ignore the lack of relevant information and fabricate details. For
almost all models, it is easier to refuse to answer based on a wrong document (irrelevant context) than to deal with empty context
(e.g., due to a failed document upload).

sesses the minimum effectiveness under both the
original query (baseline) and perturbed conditions
(a0.07to0.28decrease). Average Answer Com-
pliance for all perturbations is presented in Fig-
ure 4. The most notable declines were observed in
OCR and Out-of-Domain Query scenarios, with the
smallest tested model, Phi-3-mini-128k-Instruct,
experiencing declines reaching up to 0.17. The
most robust model is OpenAI-o3-mini, with a score
of0.90compared to the baseline score of 0.98.
Context Grounding Models showed consider-
able variation in Context Grounding, a key metric
for assessing how well responses align with pro-
vided information or its absence. Missing context
posed the biggest challenge for almost all testedmodels ( 0.21–0.68), whereas irrelevant context ap-
peared to be easier, showing consistent improve-
ment by up to 0.30across all models. Notably, rea-
soning models (OpenAI-o1/o3-mini and DeepSeek-
R1 series), which lead the robustness race, achieve
at most a 0.59score, whereas Qwen models eas-
ily achieve scores above 0.60, with the best one
scoring 0.79. The best Context Grounding score of
0.80is achieved by Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct.
Figure 6 shows how Compliance and Robust-
ness varied across query types—question answer-
ing (QA) and text generation (TG). Content genera-
tion tasks (e.g., writing a blog post) were especially
vulnerable to context alterations. When tasked with
these queries, models showed a greater tendency to

drop in performance, reaching up to 0.17for Phi-3-mini-128k-Instruct and Phi-3-medium-128k-Instruct, is observed in cases
involving OCRed queries. While the baseline performance appears relatively straightforward for all models, with scores
ranging from 0.98to0.81, the point-wise minimum across all perturbations—indicative of robustness—reveals that models face
challenges in consistently adapting to various input types. Even the most robust model, OpenAI o3-mini, experiences a decrease

Compliance The trade-off between Context
Grounding and Robustness is captured by the
LLM Compliance score: while some models, like
Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct, managed moderate Ro-
bustness ( 0.83) and satisfactory Context Ground-
ing (0.80), achieving an optimal balance in Com-
pliance scores ( 0.81), the biggest imbalance be-
tween Robustness and Context Grounding is seen
in the second-best model in the Robustness cat-
egory, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B ( 0.89vs.
0.38). In our calculation of LLM Compliance, we
usedβ= 0.5.

6.1 LLMs Robustness Evaluation
A significant line of research examines the robust-
ness of LLMs when challenged to directly handle
and interpret raw user inputs. A crucial study in
this area is the Holistic Evaluation of Language
Models (HELM) by Liang et al. (2023). HELM
investigates how LLMs manage both invariance
and equivariance under varying conditions. The
robustness of LLMs to invariance is assessed byevaluating the consistency of their outputs under
minor, semantics-preserving transformations, such
as typographical errors or changes in capitalization.
Regarding equivariance, the study examined the
models’ responses to semantically altering mod-
ifications, to see if LLMs can appropriately ad-
just their outputs when the meaning of the input
changes. This aspect was evaluated using Contrast
Sets, which provide counterfactually augmented
data for a limited set of datasets, like the BoolQ
question answering dataset and the IMDB senti-
ment analysis scenario.

This research created a special testing system called FailSafeQA to see how well AI systems handle these tricky situations. Think of it like stress-testing a car - not just on perfect highways, but on bumpy roads, in bad weather, and with unexpected obstacles. The researchers took real financial documents, generated thousands of questions about them, and then twisted these questions in various ways to make them more challenging. The system tests AI models on three key abilities: finding specific information in long documents, handling questions asked in unusual ways, and knowing when to admit they don't have enough information to answer."

use torchtune (Meta, 2024c) as the model training frame-
work with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) for both Heima Encoder
and Heima Decoder. During the progressive encoding pro-
cess, we freeze the image encoder component and fine-tune
both the decoder and fusion components of the LLaV A-CoT
model. This fine-tuning includes the entire attention and
MLP modules across all layers, as well as the output pro-
jection layer, using a rank of 16, and an alpha of 32. As
for training Heima Decoder, we apply the same lora setting
to the model. Detailed hyperparameters are included in
Appendix A. The training is conducted on 8 ×H100 GPUs.Evaluation. We adopt several challenging zero-shot
benchmarks to verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method, including MMStar (Chen et al., 2024), MMBench
V1.1 (Liu et al., 2025), MMVet (Yu et al., 2024), Math-
Vista (Lu et al., 2024), AI2D (Hiippala et al., 2021), and
HallusionBench (Guan et al., 2024). MMStar, MMBench,
and MMVet evaluate general visual question-answering ca-
pabilities, while MathVista and AI2D assess mathematical
and scientific reasoning. HallusionBench, in contrast, tar-
gets language hallucinations and visual illusions. We use the
VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024) as the evaluation pipeline
to ensure a fair comparison. We use GPT-4o (Achiam
et al., 2023) for evaluation on the MMVet and MathVista
datasets, while exact match evaluation is applied to other
datasets using VLMEvalKit. For Heima Decoder, we split
theLLaVA-CoT-100k dataset for train and test separately.
We evaluate the fine-tuned Heima Decoder on test set which
contain 4300 samples with metrics including BLEU-4 (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005),
ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019).
Additionally, we adopt GPT-4o for the similarity analysis.
4.2. Main Results
We first provide the main results for Heima Encoder in
Table 1. We compare our method to the original Llama3.1-
11B-Vision-Instruct model and the LLaV A-CoT on 6
datasets for the evaluation of zero-shot performance. Heima
outperforms the Llama3.1-11B-Vision-Instruct model in
both accuracy and performance while utilizing significantly
fewer tokens, particularly on benchmarks such as MM-
Bench, AI2D, and Hallusion. Compared to the baseline
model LLaV A-CoT, Heima retains most of the model’s per-
formance while requiring as little as 6% of the tokens on
certain datasets. Notably, on MMBench, Heima achieves
better accuracy than the baseline LLaV A-CoT. Furthermore,
to evaluate the effectiveness of progressive encoding, we in-
clude accuracy results using one-shot encoding to encode all
CoT stages through the whole training (i.e., non-progressive

encoding). The results indicate that the non-progressive
Heima Encoder performs worse, confirming the advantage
and effectiveness of the progressive encoding approach. Ad-
ditionally, the accuracy results without the recovering stage
highlight its necessity, as they demonstrate a noticeable de-
cline in performance compared to that with the recovering
stage after completing the encoding of all CoT stages.
To further investigate the model’s performance across dif-
ferent types of reasoning problems, we present detailed ac-
curacy results for various classifications of reasoning tasks
in MathVista and MMStar, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3,
respectively. In MathVista, the model retains most of its
accuracy across geometry reasoning (GR), algebraic rea-
soning (AR), geometry problem solving (GPS), and math
word problems (MWP), demonstrating that both progressive
encoding and recovering enhance the preservation of rea-
soning capabilities for mathematical problems. Meanwhile,
in MMStar, Heima outperforms Llama3.2-11B on both in-
stance reasoning (IR) and logical reasoning (LR) tasks while
using less than 10% of the tokens, and it preserves the major-
ity of its reasoning capabilities for mathematical problems
through progressive encoding.

4.3. Interpretability Analysis
To verify the effectiveness of hidden representation encod-
ing and improve interpretability of the framework, we eval-
uate the performance of Heima Decoder by assessing the
similarity between the reconstructed reasoning process and
the ground-truth CoT. We provide the results of 4 evaluation
metrics in Figure 4, and the detailed results are included in
Table A2 of Appendix B. The reconstruction is most suc-
cessful for the summary stage, followed by the caption stage,
and then the reasoning stage. This is primarily because the
summary stage relies mainly on the input question, while
both the caption and reasoning stages require detailed and
comprehensive visual information for accurate reasoning.

Figure 6. Ablation study of zero-shot performance on 6 datasets
for different number of thinking tokens for each CoT.
Notably, as shown in Figure 1, Heima Decoder uses LLMs
without visual inputs, yet it reconstructs reasoning processes
with key visual features, validating that the thinking tokens
encode visual features in hidden representations.
Furthermore, we adopt GPT-4o to evaluate the similarity be-
tween the reconstructed reasoning process and the original
CoTs, with the results presented in Figure 5. We treat the
evaluation as a ranking process to classify the performance
of reconstructed reasoning process into 5 ranks, from 1 to
5. Rank 1 represents the reconstructed reasoning process
and ground-truth CoT describes different themes and has
little overlapping in between, while Rank 5 represents the
reconstruction well aligned with the ground truth. We re-
move special tokens in both sides and input them to GPT-4o
to rank the similarity for each stage. We also include corre-
sponding image-question pairs in the prompt as additional
reference for more accurate context support. The detailed
prompts provided for GPT-4o are included in Appendix C.
We average the rank of all samples in one stage to estimate
the similarity score of the stage. The results demonstrate
that all three stages are effectively reconstructed by our
Heima Decoder, with particularly strong performance in the
summary stage, which primarily relies on textual informa-
tion. Notably, the score of the reasoning stage excels that of
the caption stage. The reasoning stage requires the integra-
tion of both textual and visual information, showcasing the
robustness and versatility of our proposed framework.
4.4. Ablation Study
We explore the performance with different number of think-
ing tokens for each CoT. We provide this ablation study on 6
datasets in Figure 6 with details in Table A3 of Appendix B.
The results show that one single token for encoding the
corresponding CoT achieves the best performance.
Additionally, we investigate adaptive encoding by regulating
the retention ratio of thinking tokens, where the number of
thinking tokens is determined as a percentage of the original
CoT token length. We provide the results in Figure 7 with
details in Table A4 of Appendix B. As observed, from 10%

to 90% retention ratio, accuracy fluctuates irregularly. There
is no consistent pattern emerging, highlighting the unpre-
dictable relationship between retention ratio and accuracy.
Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 8, the number of generated
token is continuously increasing as the retention ratio be-
comes large. Notably, when the retention ratio reaches 70%,
the number of generated tokens exceeds that of the baseline
model (i.e., LLaV A-CoT), further indicating that adaptive
encoding is not an effective method for generally capturing
the features of the reasoning process.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose Heima for efficient reasoning with
hidden thinking. We fine-tune Heima Encoder by encod-
ing each CoT into a single token, and Heima Decoder is
fine-tuned by incorporating explanatory prompts to decode
the hidden representations encapsulated within the thinking
tokens. By effectively reconstructing the reasoning process
through Heima Decoder, we demonstrate the robustness
and interpretability of our method. Experimental results
show that our method achieves comparable or even better
accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks with significantly fewer
tokens, highlighting the efficiency and reliability. In future
research, we plan to extend our method to larger models
for Heima Encoder and explore the use of smaller LLMs as
Heima Decoder to support diverse scale designs.

Algorithm 1 GPT-4o Prompt for CoT Decoding Evaluation
Input: Image I, question Q, decoded CoT ˆCoT , ground turth CoT ,
type of CoT stage T∈[caption ,summary ,reasoning ]
Output: A integer represents the rank of similarity between ˆCoT and CoT in [1, 5].
User: When responding to questions about an image, a deep analysis is crucial for providing accurate answers. The
analysis of an image-question pair could be one of the following components:
Summary – A brief restatement or paraphrasing of the question.
Caption – A description or summary of the content of the image.
Reasoning – A logical explanation of how the answer is derived from the image and the question.
You will be provided with one of them along with the ground truth. Your task is to evaluate whether the analysis is closely
aligns with the ground truth according to given image and question pair.
User: In this conversation, you will be given a generated Tand its ground truth.
TheTis:ˆCoT .
The ground truth is: CoT
User: Following is the given image: I
The corresponding question is: Q
User: Please rank the similarity with a integer between 1 and 5, where the larger number mean the generated Tis more
close to the ground truth. Please rate the similarity on a scale from 1 to 5, where:
1: Completely unrelated.
The generated Tand ground truth discuss entirely different theme, and there is no overlap in content, or subject matter.
Example: Ground Truth: ...; Generated T: ...
2: Minimally related.
The generated Tand ground truth are tangentially connected. Only minimum fraction of the theme or content in ground
truth is mentioned in the generated T.
Example: Ground Truth: ...; Generated T: ...
3: Somewhat related but with notable discrepancies.
The generated Tand ground truth share key elements in theme or content but exhibit clear differences in focus,
description, or details. While the overall themes or settings may overlap (e.g., animals, fences, grassy area), the generated
Tintroduces significant factual errors or omits important details.
Example: Ground Truth: ...; Generated T: ...
4: Closely related with small differences.
The generated Tand ground truth align on the main theme and share most of the key details. However, there are minor
differences in phrasing, specific details, or focus.
Example: Ground Truth: ...; Generated T: ...
5: Nearly identical.
The generated Tand ground truth are highly similar, sharing nearly all content, details, and key descriptions, with only
minor or negligible phrasing differences.
Example: Ground Truth: ...; Generated T: ...
The output should be in a json format:
{”T”: (Rank), ”reason”: ... }
(Rank) is the integer of the similarity rank.
“reason” storages the reason of ranking a given Tand ground truth.

14","The research introduces a way to make AI reasoning more efficient, similar to how humans often reach conclusions without explaining every step. Instead of writing out every detail of their thinking process, the AI models learn to do more ""mental math"" internally. Think of it like solving a math problem - rather than writing down every small calculation, an experienced person might skip straight to key steps. This approach, called efficient reasoning with hidden thinking , helps AI systems work faster while staying just as accurate. The method builds on existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning , which is like showing your work in math class. But this new approach lets the AI skip writing out obvious or repetitive steps, making the whole process more streamlined."

ABSTRACT
Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2 ,GPT-3(.5) andGPT-4
demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such
language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to
stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this
paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n}once LLMs contribute
much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes
irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear.
We refer to this effect as model collapse1and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders,
Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and
portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken
seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web.
Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly
valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.
1 Introduction
A lot of human communication happens online. Billions of emails are exchanged daily, along with billions of social-
media messages and millions of news articles. Almost all of this material was produced and curated only by humans in
the early years of the worldwide web, yet since the turn of the century search engines have come to determine what
people can find, and in the past decade smart text editors with spelling and grammar correction have helped tweak what
we produce. Now, text can not only be groomed and analysed efficiently; it can also be generated – by large language
models (LLMs). These models now (arguably) pass a weaker form of the Turing test in the sense that their output
cannot be reliably distinguished from text written by humans [Solaiman et al., 2019].
The development of LLMs is quite involved and requires masses of training data. Anecdotally, some powerful recent
models are trained using scrapes of much of the Internet, then further fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) [Griffith et al., 2013, OpenAI, 2023]. This further boosts the effective dataset size. Yet while
current LLMs [Devlin et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2022], including GPT-4 , were
trained on predominantly human-generated text, this may change in the future. If most future models’ training data
is also scraped from the web, then they will inevitably come to train on data produced by their predecessors. In this
paper, we investigate what happens when text produced, e.g.by a version of GPT, forms most of the training dataset of
following models. What happens to GPTversions GPT-{ n}as generation nincreases?2
1The name is inspired by the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) literature on mode collapse, where GANs start producing
a limited set of outputs that all trick the discriminator. Model Collapse is a process whereby models eventually converge to a state
similar to that of a GAN Mode Collapse. The original version of this paper referred to this effect as ‘model dementia’, but we decided
to change this following feedback that it trivialised the medical notion of ‘dementia’ and could cause offence.
2This is not limited to text models; one can also consider what happens when music created by human composers and played by
human musicians trains models whose output trains other models.arXiv:2305.17493v3 [cs.LG] 14 Apr 2024
Model Collapse
We discover that learning from data produced by other models causes model collapse – a degenerative process whereby,
over time, models forget the true underlying data distribution, even in the absence of a shift in the distribution over time.
We give examples of model collapse for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Variational Autoencoders (V AE) and
Large Language models (LLMs). We show that over time we start losing information about the true distribution, which
first starts with tails disappearing, and over the generations learned behaviours start converging to a point estimate with
very small variance. Furthermore, we show that this process is inevitable, even for cases with almost ideal conditions
for long-term learning i.e.no function estimation error.
Figure 1: Model Collapse refers to a degenerative learning
process where models start forgetting improbable events
over time, as the model becomes poisoned with its own
projection of reality.Finally, we discuss the broader implications of model
collapse . We note that access to the original data dis-
tribution is crucial: in learning where the tails of the
underlying distribution matter, one needs access to real
human-produced data. In other words, the use of LLMs
at scale to publish content on the Internet will pollute
the collection of data to train them: data about human
interactions with LLMs will be increasingly valuable.
This paper is structured as follows. First, in Sections 3
and 4 we describe the reasons why model collapse hap-
pens. To best describe the intuition, we present a simple
example of a single-dimensional Gaussian where errors
due to sampling inevitably cause model collapse , which
are then extended to a multidimensional generative model
under some assumptions. Under both models, similar
lower bounds are derived on the risk, defined in terms of
the Wasserstein distance from the true distribution. Next,
we turn to GMMs and V AEs to show that additional
functional approximation errors further exacerbate model
collapse . Finally, we discuss the most commonly used
setting of fine-tuned language models, where we report
that only early signs of model collapse can be detected, if models are fine-tuned as opposed to trained from scratch.
In this paper we make the following contributions:
• We demonstrate the existence of a degenerative process in learning and name it model collapse ;
• We demonstrate that model collapse exists in a variety of different model types and datasets;
• We show that, to avoid model collapse , access to genuine human-generated content is essential.
2 Related work
In this section we are going to cover two closest concepts to model collapse from existing literature: catastrophic
forgetting and data poisoning. Neither is able to explain the phenomenon of model collapse fully, as the setting is
fundamentally different, but they provide another perspective on the observed phenomenon.
2.1 Continual learning and catastrophic forgetting
Unlike traditional machine learning which seeks to learn from a static data distribution, continual learning attempts
to learn from a dynamic one, where data are supplied in a sequential fashion [Van de Ven and Tolias, 2019]. This
tends to be task-based, where data are provided with delineated task boundaries; e.g., classifying dogs from cats and
recognising handwritten digits. Our work is more similar to task-free continual learning [Aljundi et al., 2019] where
data distributions gradually change without the notion of separate tasks. Our work examines a particular scenario in
which the changed data distributions arise from the model itself, as a result of training in the previous iteration.

itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other
authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers
based on early examples of Perpendicular

Perpendicular Revival architecture is found in the 18th @-@ century Church of Our Lady of Guernsey,
which dates from the late 19th century. There are two types of perpendicular churches : those

that they may have been built during the reign of his successor, Pope Innocent

A typical challenge in continual learning is that the model forgets previous samples when learning new information; this
is known as catastrophic forgetting [Kirkpatrick et al., 2017]. A typical way of preventing it is to use regularisations
(Memory Aware Synpass [Aljundi et al., 2018]) or just rely on data ( e.g.Learning without Forgetting [Li and Hoiem,
2017]). This has an indirect connection to our work, yet differs since the data in the process of model collapse are
generated by different generations of models.
2.2 Data poisoning
Poisoning attacks are crafted and inserted during training in order to degrade the model’s performance when de-
ployed [Biggio et al., 2012]. Malicious data can be inserted into training data to induce unintended behaviors that can
be activated by special triggers [Gu et al., 2017]. The early literature on data poisoning focused mainly on supervised
learning, where classifiers are trained with labeled samples. But with the emergence of contrastive learning [Radford
et al., 2021] and LLMs [Brown et al., 2020], more recent models are trained with large-scale web crawls, making data
poisoning attacks more feasible on these untrustworthy web sources. Recent studies have demonstrated that web-scale
datasets can be poisoned by introducing malicious data into a small percentage of samples [Carlini and Terzis, 2021,
Carlini et al., 2023].
3 What is Model Collapse ?
Definition 3.1 (Model Collapse ).Model Collapse is a degenerative process affecting generations of learned generative
models, where generated data end up polluting the training set of the next generation of models; being trained on
polluted data, they then mis-perceive reality. We separate two special cases: early model collapse andlatemodel
collapse . In early model collapse the model begins losing information about the tails of the distribution; in the late model
collapse model entangles different modes of the original distributions and converges to a distribution that carries little
resemblance to the original one, often with very small variance.
Note that this process is different from the process of catastrophic forgetting in that we are considering multiple models
over time, in which our models do not forget previously learned data, but rather start misinterpreting what they believe
to be real, by reinforcing their own beliefs.
This process occurs due to two specific sources of error compounding over generations and causing deviation from the
original model. Of these, one source of error plays a primary role, and in the absence of it, the process would not occur
beyond the first generation.

Model Collapse
Figure 2: The high-level description of the feedback mechanism in the learning process. Here, data are assumed to be
human-curated and start off clean; then model 0is trained and data are sampled from it; at step n, data are added to the
overall data from step n−1, and this ensemble is used to train model n. Data obtained with Monte Carlo sampling
should ideally be statistically close to the original, provided fitting andsampling procedures are perfect. This process
depicts what happens in real life with the Internet – model-generated data become pervasive.
3.1 Causes of model collapse
There are two main causes for model collapse , one primary and one secondary, which we describe now. Further
mathematical intuition is provided in Section 4 to explain how these give rise to the errors observed, how different
sources can compound and how we can quantify the average model divergence rate.
•Statistical approximation error – this is the primary type of error, which arises due to the number of samples
being finite, and disappears as the number of samples tends to infinity. This occurs due to a non-zero probability
that information can get lost at every step of re-sampling. Figure 12 shows an example of an approximation
error. Here, a single-dimensional Gaussian is being approximated from a finite number of samples. Despite
using a very large number of points, the errors remain significant; with 107samples we estimate the mean to
be0.00024899 ±1.89382984 e−4, when the true value is 0.
•Functional approximation error – this is a secondary type of error, which stems from our function approx-
imators being insufficiently expressive (or sometimes too expressive outside of the original distribution
support [Nguyen et al., 2015]). It is well known that neural networks are universal functional approximators
in the limit, but in practice this is not always true. In particular, a neural network can introduce non-zero
likelihood outside of the support of the original distribution. A simple example of this error is if we were to try
fitting a mixture of two Gaussians with a single Gaussian. Even if we have perfect information about the data
distribution, model errors will be inevitable. It is important to also note that in the absence of statistical error,
functional approximation error only occurs at the first generation. Once the new distribution belongs to the
image of functional approximator, it remains exactly the same over the generations.
Each of the above can cause model collapse to get worse or better. Better approximation power can even be a double-
edged sword – better expressiveness may counteract statistical noise, resulting in a good approximation of the true
distribution, but it can equally compound this noise. More often then not, we get a cascading effect where combined
individual inaccuracy causes the overall error to grow. Overfitting the density model will cause the model to extrapolate
incorrectly and might give high density to low-density regions not covered in the training set support; these will then be
sampled with arbitrary frequency.
It is worth mentioning that modern computers also have a further computational error coming from the way floating
point numbers are represented. This error is not evenly spread across different floating point ranges, making it hard to
estimate the precise value of a given number. Such errors are smaller in magnitude and are fixable with more precise
hardware, making them less influential on model collapse .

Model Collapse
4 Theoretical intuition
In this section we aim to provide a theoretical intuition for the phenomenon of model collapse . We argue that the process
ofmodel collapse is universal among generative models that recursively train on data generated by previous generations.
We construct toy mathematical models, which prove to be simple enough to provide analytical expressions for quantities
of interest, but also portray the phenomenon of model collapse . We aim to quantify how different sources of error can
affect the overall end approximation of the original distribution. As discussed in Section 3.1, there are two main sources
we are interested in – statistical error and functional error. Since in the real world one rarely has infinite samples,
quantifying the functional approximation error alone is of little interest for discussion of model collapse . Therefore, we
will examine two simple cases: a discrete distribution in the absence of functional approximation error and a single
dimensional Gaussian case, which portrays how functional approximation error can compound with statistical error.
The overall stochastic process we are going to be considering (which we call Learning with Generational Data ) is
the following. Assume that at generation iwe have a dataset Dicomprising of i.i.d. random variables Xi
j, where
j∈ {1, . . . , M i}denotes the sample number at generation iandMi≥2. We will denote the distribution of Xiaspi.
Here we assume that p0denotes the original distribution, from which the data comes from. Going from generation i
to generation i+ 1, we aim to estimate the distribution of samples in Di, with an approximation pθi+1. This step is
what we refer to as functional approximation Fθ:pi→pθi+1. We then resample the dataset Di+1from the distribution
pi+1=αipθi+1+βipi+γip0, with non-negative parameters αi, βi, γisumming up to 1,i.e.they represent proportions
of data used from different generations. This corresponds to a mixing of data coming from the original distribution ( γi),
data used by the previous generation ( βi) and data generated by the new model ( αi). We refer to this as the sampling
step. For the mathematical models to come, we consider αi=γi= 0i.e.data only from a single step is used, while
numerical experiments are performed on more realistic choices of parameters.
4.1 Discrete distributions with exact approximation
In this subsection we consider a discrete probability distribution, which is represented by a histogram, e.g.as shown on
Figure 3. In what follows we consider the stochastic process in absence of functional approximation error, i.e.F(p) =p.
In this case, model collapse arises only due to statistical errors from the sampling step. At first, the tails (low probability
events) begin to disappear due to low probability of sampling them, and over time the distribution becomes a delta
function. Denoting the sample size as M, if we consider state iwith probability q≤1
M, the expected number of
samples with value icoming from those events will be less than 1, which means that in practice we will lose information
about them. This is portrayed on Figure 3, where infrequent events get cut off. Considering more generally some state
iwith probability q, using standard conditional probability one can show that the probability of losing information
(i.e.sampling no data at some generation) is equal to 1−q. But this in turn means that we must converge to a delta
function positioned at some state, and the probability of ending up at a certain state is equal to the probability of
sampling said state from the original distribution.
But how do we show directly that this process is going to turn our distribution into a delta function? By considering the
process as going from Xi→ F θ→pi+1→Xi+1, we see that this forms a Markov Chain, as Xi+1only depends on
Xi. Furthermore, if all the Xi
jhave the same value, then at the next generation the approximated distribution will be
exactly a delta function, and therefore all of Xi+1
jwill also have the same value. This implies that the Markov chain
contains at least one absorbing state, and therefore with probability 1 it will converge to one of the absorbing states.
This is a well-known fact, of which a proof is provided in Appendix A.1. For this chain, the only absorbing states are
those corresponding to delta functions. As a result, as we follow the progress of model collapse , we are guaranteed
to end up in a constant state, having lost all the information of the original distribution when the chain is absorbed.3
Based on the discussion above we see how both early and late stage model collapse must arise in the case of discrete
distributions with perfect functional approximation.
4.2 Single dimensional Gaussian
Following the discussion about discrete distributions, we now move on to considering how both functional approximation
error and sampling error can compound (or cancel out) the process of model collapse .
To demonstrate this, consider a single dimensional Gaussian X0∼ N(µ, σ2). If we have full faith in the data we
observe, the functional approximation involves estimating sample mean and variance and fitting a single dimensional
3This argument also works in general due to floating point representations being discrete, making the Markov Chain over the
parameters of the model discrete. Thus as long as the model parameterisation allows for delta functions, we willget to it, as due to
sampling errors the only possible absorbing states are delta functions.

Note here, that if we were to use maximum likelihood estimation, we would instead arrive at a biased variance estimator.

these parameters, which we can sample from:
Xi+1
j|µi+1, σi+1∼ N(µi+1, σ2

This provides us with the conditional distribution of Xi
j, which allows us to calculate the full distribution of Xi
j. From
Equation (3), we see that even after the first approximation, the distribution of Xi
jis no longer normal, it follows a
variance-gamma distribution [Fischer et al., 2023]. However, instead of writing the probability density function at each
generation, we can explicitly construct them in terms of independent random variables. In particular, it is well known
[Cochran, 1934] that µ1andσ1are independent, with µ1∼ N(µ,σ2

The first thing we may try calculating is the variance. It is possible to find its exact value, but the mean and variance of
the square root of gamma distribution are expressed in terms of gamma functions, making the result quite clunky. In
what follows, we will expand everything to second order in each of (1/Mi)as we assume each sample size to be large

Model Collapse
This means that as n→ ∞ , the variance diverges linearly. This is the same scaling as for a single dimensional Gaussian
random walk. We can further see the similarities in numerical experiments shown on Figure 4 for a range of different
sample sizes, confirming these theoretical intuitions.
Even though the variance of Xn
jdiverges, it does not provide us with any information of what the corresponding
estimates of µn+1andσ2
n+1are, or how far they are from the original µandσ. In particular, we may want to consider
what the distance would be between the true distribution and the approximated distribution at step n+ 1. To measure
this we can consider the Wasserstein-2 distance between two normals:

Abstract
The quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation of Transformers limits
their ability to scale to long sequences, and while sub-quadratic solutions like linear
attention and state space models exist, they empirically underperform Transformers
in pretraining efficiency and downstream task accuracy. We introduce MEGA-
LODON , an neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited
context length. MEGALODON inherits the architecture of MEGA (exponential
moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical
components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponen-
tial moving average (CEMA) ,timestep normalization layer, normalized attention
mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled
head-to-head comparison with LLAMA 2,MEGALODON achieves better efficiency
than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.
MEGALODON reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between LLAMA 2-
7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67). The improvements of MEGALODON over Transformers
are robust throughout a range of benchmarks across different tasks and modalities.

1 Introduction
In many real-world applications, such as multi-turn conversation, long-document comprehension,
and video generation, large language models (LLMs) must efficiently process long sequential data,
understand internal long-range dynamics, and generate coherent output. The Transformer archi-
tecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), despite its remarkable capabilities, faces challenges with quadratic
computational complexity and limited inductive bias for length generalization, making it inefficient
for long sequence modeling (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Even with recently proposed
distributed attention solutions (Li et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2024), computing a single training step of a
7B parameter model over a 1M-token sequence is more than 100 times slower than performing the
equivalent computation using 256 separate sequences of 4K tokens each.
Techniques like efficient attention mechanisms (Tay et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021) and structured state
space models (Gu et al., 2022a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu and Dao, 2023) have been introduced to overcome
these limitations, aiming to enhance scalability and performance. However, the practical application
of these methods still falls short of Transformers (Tay et al., 2022; Gu and Dao, 2023). This work
introduces an unlimited context model that outperforms the canonical Transformer architecture on
real-world language modeling.

We introduce MEGALODON , an improved MEGA architecture (Ma et al., 2023), which harnesses
the gated attention mechanism with the classical exponential moving average (EMA) (Hunter, 1986)
approach ( §2). To further improve the capability and efficiency of MEGALODON on large-scale long-
context pretraining, we propose multiple novel technical components. First, MEGALODON introduces
thecomplex exponential moving average (CEMA) component, which extends the multi-dimensional
damped EMA in MEGA to the complex domain ( §3.1). Then, MEGALODON proposes the timestep
normalization layer, which generalizes the group normalization layer (Wu and He, 2018) to auto-
regressive sequence modeling tasks to allow normalization along the sequential dimension ( §3.2). To
improve large-scale pretraining stability, MEGALODON further proposes normalized attention (§3.3),
together with pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration by modifying the widely-adopted pre-
and post-normalization methods ( §3.4). By simply chunking input sequences into fixed blocks, as is
done in MEGA-chunk (Ma et al., 2023), MEGALODON achieves linear computational and memory
complexity in both model training and inference.
Empirically, we demonstrate the potential of MEGALODON as a general architecture for modeling
long sequences, by evaluating its performance across multiple scales of language modeling, as well
as downstream domain-specific tasks. Through a direct comparison with LLAMA 2, while controlling
for data and compute, MEGALODON -7B significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art variant of
Transformer used to train L LAMA 2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) on both training perplexity (Figure 1)
and across downstream benchmarks (Table 1). Evaluation on long-context modeling, including
perplexity in various context lengths up to 2M and long-context QA tasks in Scrolls (Parisotto et al.,
2020) prove MEGALODON ’s ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experimental
results on small/medium-scale benchmarks, including LRA (Tay et al., 2021), ImageNet (Deng et al.,
2009), Speech Commands (Warden, 2018), WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2017) and PG19 (Rae et al.,
2019), demonstrate the robust improvements of M EGALODON across scales and modalities.

2 Background: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention (M EGA)
In this section, we setup notations, briefly review the key components in the MEGA architecture (Ma
et al., 2023), and discuss the existing problems in M EGA.
Following the notations in MEGA, we use X={x1,x2, . . . , xn} ∈ Rn×dandY=
{y1,y2, . . . , yn} ∈Rn×dto denote the input and output sequences with length n, and assume
the representations of the input and output sequences have the same dimension d.
2.1 Multi-dimensional Damped EMA
MEGA embeds an EMA component into the calculation of the attention matrix to incorporate
inductive biases across the timestep dimension. Concretely, the multi-dimensional damped EMA first
expands each dimension of the input sequence Xindividually into hdimensions via an expansion
matrix β∈Rd×h, then applies damped EMA to the h-dimensional hidden space. Formally, for each
dimension j∈ {1,2, . . . , d }:
u(j)
t=βjxt,j
h(j)
t=αj⊙u(j)
t+ (1−αj⊙δj)⊙h(j)
t−1 (1)
yt,j=ηT
jh(j)
t
where u(j)
t∈Rhis the expanded h-dimensional vector for the j-th dimension at timestep t.α∈
(0,1)d×h,δ∈(0,1)d×hare the decaying and damping factors, respectively. h(j)
t∈Rhis the EMA
hidden state for the j-th dimension at timestep t.η∈Rd×his the projection matrix to map the
h-dimensional hidden state back to 1-dimensional output yt,j∈R.
2.2 Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention
In the gated attention mechanism in MEGA, the output from EMA (1)is used to compute the
shared representation (Hua et al., 2022), because it encodes contextual information through EMA.
Subsequently, MEGA introduces the reset gate, the update gate , and computes the candidate activation
with the update gate and the residual connection. The technical details are provided in Appendix A.
2.3 Existing Problems in M EGA
To reduce the quadratic complexity in the full attention mechanism, MEGA simply split the sequences
of queries, keys and values in (14-16) into chunks of length c. The attention in (17) is individually
applied to each chunk, yielding linear complexity O(kc2) =O(nc). Technically, the EMA sub-layer
inMEGA helps capture local contextual information near each token, mitigating the problem of losing
contextual information beyond chunk boundaries in the chunk-wise attention.
Despite the impressive successes of MEGA, it still suffers its own problems: i) the performance of
MEGA with chunk-wise attention still fails behind the one with full attention, due to the limited
expressiveness of the EMA sub-layer in MEGA. ii) for different tasks and/or data types, there are
architectural divergences in the final MEGA architectures. For example, different normalization
layers, normalization patterns (pre-norm vs. post-norm) and attention functions ( f(·)in(17)) are
applied to different data types (see Ma et al. (2023) for details). iii) There are no empirical evidences
showing that M EGA is scalable for large-scale pretraining.
3 M EGALODON
To address the aforementioned problems of MEGA, in this section we describe the novel technical
advancements of M EGALODON .
3.1 CEMA: Extending Multi-dimensional Damped EMA to Complex Domain
As discussed in Ma et al. (2023), the EMA component can be regarded as a simplified state space
model with diagonal state matrix. Directly inspired from Gu et al. (2022b), as almost all matrices

and variances. We omit the batch dimension for simplicity.
diagonalize over the complex plane, a straight-forward idea to improve EMA capability is to extend
to work over the complex number system C. We propose the complex exponential moving average
(CEMA) , which re-writes Eq. (1):
h(j)
t=αj(cosθj+isinθj)⊙u(j)
t+ (1−αj⊙δj)(cos θj+isinθj)⊙h(j)
t−1
yt,j= Re(ηT
jh(j)
t) (2)
whereα,δ∈Rd×hare the real number parameters same as in EMA. Different from EMA, η∈Cd×h
in CEMA are complex numbers. θj∈Rh, j∈ {1,2, . . . , d }are the harguments. To uniformly
space the harguments over the period 2π, we parameterize θjas:
θj,k=2πk
hωj,∀k∈ {1,2, . . . , h } (3)
where the learnable parameter ω∈Rddepicts the dbase angles. By decaying the absolute value of
eachht, CEMA preserves the decaying structure in kernel weights, which is a key principle to the
success of convolutional models on long sequence modeling (Li et al., 2023c).
3.2 Timestep Normalization
Despite the impressive performance of Layer Normalization combined with Transformer, it is obvious
that layer normalization cannot directly reduce the internal covariate shift along the spatial dimension
(a.k.a timestep or sequential dimension) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). Group Normalization (Wu and
He, 2018) normalizes hidden representations both along the timestep dimension and a subset of
the feature dimension, which has obtained improvements over Layer Normalization on a range of
computer vision tasks. However, it cannot be directly applied to Transformer on auto-regressive
sequence modeling, due to the leakage of future information via the mean and variance across the
timestep dimension.
InMEGALODON , we extend Group Normalization to the auto-regressive case by computing the
cumulative mean and variance. Formally, suppose an input sequence X={x1,x2, . . . , xn} ∈Rn×d,
andkgroups along the feature dimension with dg=d/kelements per group. Then, the mean and
variance of the first group at timestep t∈ {1,2, . . . , n }are:
µt=1
t∗dgtX
i=1dgX
j=1xi,j, σ2
t=1
t∗dgtX
i=1dgX
j=1(xi,j−µt)2(4)
Figure 2 illustrates Layer Normalization and Timestep Normalization. To efficiently and precisely
calculate the cumulative mean and variance in each timestep, we provide hardware-friendly imple-
mentation on modern hardware (GPU) (see Appendix B.1).
3.3 Normalized Attention in M EGALODON
Previous studies have investigated the saturation and instability issues in the original scaled dot-
product attention (17). A number of novel techniques have emerged to modify the scaled dot-product
attention, among which normalized attention mechanisms, such as (scaled-) cosine attention (Luo
et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022) and QK-normalization (Henry et al., 2020), have stood out for the
simplicity and effectiveness.

is a new type of large language model (LLM) that can handle very long input texts, unlike traditional LLMs that struggle with long contexts. LLMs are AI systems that are trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like language. The key innovation in Megalodon is its use of a technique called Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention (Mega) . This allows the model to efficiently process long input texts without losing important information. By using Mega, Megalodon can perform better on tasks that require understanding of long-form content, such as summarizing lengthy documents or answering questions about complex topics. Traditional LLMs often have difficulty maintaining context and coherence over long stretches of text. The authors show that Megalodon outperforms other state-of-the-art models on various long-context benchmarks, while also being more efficient in terms of computational resources. This means Megalodon can be deployed on a wider range of devices and applications, including those with limited processing power."

","The researchers were interested in understanding how the use of ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, is affecting the way students write for academic purposes. They focused on analyzing the use of uncommon and advanced vocabulary words in student writing, as this can be an indicator of how language models are shaping academic writing styles. To provide context, the researchers also looked at other studies that have explored related topics, such as how large language models can influence citation patterns in research papers, how students are using these models, and how the public views the impact of these technologies on academia."

Abstract
Recentworksuggeststhatlargelanguagemodelsmayimplicitlylearnworldmodels.
How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case
where theunderlying realityis governedby adeterministic finiteautomaton. This
includesproblemsasdiverseassimplelogicalreasoning,geographicnavigation,
game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model
recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We
illustratetheirutilityinthreedomains: gameplaying,logicpuzzles,andnavigation.
In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics
forassessingworldmodels,butourevaluationmetricsrevealtheirworldmodels
to be farless coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using
a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures.

1 Introduction
Largelanguagemodels(LLMs)appeartohavecapacitiesthatfarexceedthenext-tokenprediction
task they were trained to perform [ 17,39,35]. Recent work suggests a reason: they are implicitly
recovering high-fidelity representations of the underlying domains they are trained on [1, 20].
Analgorithmthatrecovers a“worldmodel”fromsequence datawould beextremelyvaluable. As
an example, consider how one might build a navigation tool today: meticulously map each street and
intersection, and then use a search algorithm to provide directions. The success of language models
suggests an alternative approach: collect turn-by-turn sequences from trips in a city (e.g. “ East
North...”) and then train a sequence model on them. If the sequence model successfully recovers
the world model, we would obtain a map of the city without ever mapping it and a routing algorithm
simply by predicting the next turn. This example is not far-fetched: it is the reason language models
are used in scientific domains such as protein generation, genetics and chemistry [7, 21, 3, 14, 6].
All of this relies on the presumption that the sequence model has recovered the true world model;
but how can we test whether it actually has? Answering this question requires first defining what
we mean by the true world model. Toshniwal et al. [36]and Li et al. [20]proposed a concrete and
influentialapproach: studywhethersequencemodelstrainedonboardgametranscripts(e.g. chess

We show the difficulty in evaluating implicit world models. Consider an existing approach: for a
givensequence,comparethenexttokensoutputtedbythegenerativemodeltothesetofvalidnext
tokens for the state implied by that sequence [ 36,20]. Though intuitive, this approach can fail to
diagnose severe problems, and we illustrate this concretely. The classic Myhill-Nerode theorem
[26,27] provides intuition: every pair of distinct states can be distinguished by some sequence
(admittedbyonestatebutnottheother). Unlessthoseminimaldistinguishingsequencesareoflength
one, looking at the next singletoken outputted will not reliably assess whether the generative model
has an accurate model of the underlying state.
ThelogicofMyhill-Nerodesuggeststwometricsformeasuringwhetheragenerativemodeleffectively
captures underlying states and transitions. The first metric summarizes sequence compression : under
the DFA, sequences that lead to the same state must have the same continuations; so one can test
whether the generative model has similar sequences of outputs when started on these two sequences.
The second metric summarizes sequence distinction : under the DFA, two sequences that lead to
distinctstatesshouldhavedistinctcontinuations;soonecantestwhetherthegenerativemodelmatches
these distinct outputs when started at these two sequences. We formally define these metrics and
provide model-agnostic procedures for calculating them when given query access to the true DFA.
To illustrate these ideas, we first take the stylized mapping example literally. We construct a turn-by-
turn sequence dataset of taxi rides in New York City. We then assess to what extent transformers
successfully recover the true street map of Manhattan. By the usual metrics, the transformers do
very well: their predicted next-direction is a valid turn nearly 100% of the time and their state
representations even appear to encode the current location of the ride. Our evaluation methods
reveal they are very far from recovering the true street map of New York City. As a visualization,
we use graph reconstruction techniques to recover each model’s implicit street map of New York
City. The resulting map bears little resemblance to the actual streets of Manhattan, containing streets
withimpossiblephysicalorientationsandflyoversaboveotherstreets(seeFigure3). Becausethese
transformers fail to recover the true street map of New York City, they are fragile for downstream
tasks. Whiletheysometimeshaveamazingrouteplanningabilities,their performancebreaksdown
when detours are introduced.
These results are not unique to maps and navigation. For both Othello and logic puzzles, we use our
evaluation metrics to show language models can perform remarkably well on some tasks despite

2 Framework
Inthissection,welayoutaframeworktointerfacebetweengenerativesequencemodelsandworld
models represented by deterministic finite automata. Both of these are built on the shared scaffolding
of tokens, sequences (a.k.a. strings), and languages.
Tokens and sequences. We consider a finite alphabet Σwith tokens 𝑎∈Σ, and sequences
𝑠=(𝑎1,𝑎2,...). LetΣ∗denote the collection of sequences on the alphabet.
Generative models. Agenerative model 𝑚(·):Σ∗→Δ(Σ)is a probability distribution over
next-tokens given an input sequence. That is, 𝑚(𝑠)∈Δ(Σ), and𝑚(𝑎|𝑠)is the probability assigned
totoken𝑎∈Σgivenaninputsequence 𝑠. Startingatasequence 𝑠,thesetofnon-emptysequences
the model can generate with positive probability is:
𝐿𝑚(𝑠)={𝑎1𝑎2...𝑎𝑘:∀𝑗 < 𝑘, 𝑚(𝑎𝑗+1|𝑠𝑎1...𝑎𝑗)>0}.
For simplicity, we write the equation above for next-tokens with nonzero probability, but in practice
we set a minimum probability 𝜖 >0corresponding to next-tokens with non-negligible probability.
Deterministic finite automata (DFA). We use standard notation for a deterministic finite state
automaton𝑊=(𝑄,Σ,𝛿,𝑞 0,𝐹)(see Appendix C for a complete definition). As a simplifying
assumption,weconsiderthecasewherethereisaspecialstate 𝑞rejectwithnooutgoingtransitionsand
𝐹=𝑄\{𝑞reject}(i.e., the DFA accepts all valid states). An extended transition function ˆ𝛿takes a
stateandasequence,anditinductivelyapplies 𝛿toeachtokenofthesequence. Atokenorasequence
isvalidif and only if the output of 𝛿orˆ𝛿respectively starting from 𝑞0is not𝑞reject.
Wedefine𝐿𝑊(𝑞)tobethesetofvalid,non-emptysequencesthatareacceptedbytheDFAstartingat
state𝑞. We also define 𝑞(𝑠)∈𝐹to bethe state thatsequence 𝑠leads toin the DFAstarting from 𝑞0
and𝑆(𝑞)⊆Σ∗to be the collection of all sequences that lead from state 𝑞0to state𝑞in the DFA.
2.1 Recovering world models
Throughout this paper we assume that the ground-truth sequences used to train and test a generative
model belong to the language of a deterministic finite state automaton 𝑊. This generalizes past work
(e.g.,onassumingsequencescomefromlegalmovesinagame[ 36,20])andallowsustoformally
define world recovery.
Definition 2.1. A generative model 𝑚(·)recovers the DFA 𝑊if
∀𝑞∈𝐹,∀𝑠∈𝑆(𝑞):𝐿𝑊(𝑞)=𝐿𝑚(𝑠).
That is, recovery requires that a sequence can be generated with positive probability by the model
𝑚(·)if and only if the sequence is valid in the DFA 𝑊.
Recoveryisdefinedatthelanguagelevel. However,generativemodelsareoftenbuiltandevaluated
token-by-token. It turns out that exact next-token prediction is enough for recovery of the language of
the world model.
Definition2.2. Agenerative model 𝑚(·)satisfiesexactnext-token prediction underthe DFA 𝑊if
∀𝑞∈𝐹,∀𝑠∈𝑆(𝑞),∀𝑎∈Σ:𝑚(𝑎|𝑠)>0⇐⇒𝛿(𝑞,𝑎)≠𝑞reject.
Proposition 2.3. A generative model 𝑚(·)recovers the DFA 𝑊if and only if it satisfies exact
next-token prediction under the DFA 𝑊.
Proposition 2.3 (proof given in Appendix A) suggests a way to evaluate whether a generative model
recoversthetrueDFA:assessthevalidityofnext-tokenpredictions. Existingworldmodeldiagnostics
are motivated by this intuition; for example, one way that Toshniwal et al. [36]and Li et al. [20]
assess world model recovery is by measuring the percent of top next-token predictions that are valid.

contains approximately 8.8×1027sequences of length 29 that do not distinguish the two boards.
2.2 Next-token prediction is a fragile metric for recovering structure
Next-token prediction, however, is a limited evaluation metric. While exact next-token prediction
impliesperfectworldmodelrecovery,beingverynearlycorrectonnext-tokenpredictiondoesnot
mean having very nearly recovered the world model. This can be illustrated by a simple example.
Example: CumulativeConnect-4. Consideraverticalgridwith 𝑛rowsand7columns. Twoplayers

Whenadiskisdroppedinacolumn,itoccupiesthebottom-mostpositionthatisn’toccupiedbyanother

7 indicating the column the disk is placed in. Here, Σ={1,..., 7}denotes the columns and the state
correspondstothecountineachcolumn. Acolumnisavalidmoveifthatcolumnisnotalreadyfilled.
Consider a generative model that outputs {1,..., 7}with uniform probability given any sequence, i.e.

2.3 The Myhill-Nerode interior and boundary
CumulativeConnect-4pointstoageneralfragilityinnext-tokenpredictionasanevaluationmetric
that can be understood in the context of the Myhill-Nerode theorem [ 26,27], a classic result from
language theory. The Myhill-Nerode theorem states that the sets of sequences accepted by a minimal
DFA starting at two distinct states are distinct (see Appendix C for a full statement). More formally,
forstates𝑞1≠𝑞2,wehave𝐿𝑊(𝑞1)≠𝐿𝑊(𝑞2). However,whiledistinct,thetwosetsmayexhibita
greatdealofoverlap. CumulativeConnect-4exhibitsthisbehavior;anyboardforwhichthereareless
than𝑘disks in each column will have the same set of valid moves for the next 𝑛−𝑘moves. This
intuition motivates a pair of definitions:
Definition 2.4. Given a DFA 𝑊, theMyhill-Nerode interior for the pair𝑞1,𝑞2∈𝐹is the set of
sequences accepted when starting at both states:
MNI𝑊(𝑞1,𝑞2)={𝑠∈Σ∗|𝑠∈𝐿𝑊(𝑞1)∩𝐿𝑊(𝑞2)}.
TheMyhill-Nerode boundary is the set of minimal suffixes accepted by a DFA at 𝑞1but not𝑞2:
MNB𝑊(𝑞1,𝑞2)={𝑠=𝑎1𝑎2...𝑎𝑘|𝑠∈𝐿𝑊(𝑞1)\𝐿𝑊(𝑞2)and∀𝑗 < 𝑘 :𝑎1...𝑎𝑗∈MNI𝑊(𝑞1,𝑞2)}.
Figure 1 depicts an example Myhill-Nerode interior and boundary for cumulative Connect 4.

perform well on next-token prediction tests; this is why the simple generative model succeeds in
the cumulative Connect-4 example. To properly differentiate states, we must consider sequences
that are long enough to be differentiated. In the remainder of the paper, we (i) use the Myhill-Nerode
logic to develop new evaluation metrics and (ii) apply these to several applications.
2.4 Compression and distinction metrics for evaluating world models
We propose metrics to evaluate a model’s implicit world model by comparing the true Myhill-Nerode
boundary to the one implied by the model.
Definition 2.5. For two sequences 𝑠1,𝑠2, theMyhill-Nerode boundary implied by model 𝑚(·)is
MNB𝑚(𝑠1,𝑠2)={𝑥=𝑥1...𝑥𝑘|𝑥∈𝐿𝑚(𝑠1)\𝐿𝑚(𝑠2)and∀𝑗 < 𝑘 :𝑥1...𝑥𝑗∈𝐿𝑚(𝑠1)∩𝐿𝑚(𝑠2)}.(1)
This is the set of minimal suffixes that are accepted by the model conditioned on 𝑠1but not𝑠2. Since
we now focus on the generative model rather than the DFA, the definition refers to pairs of sequences
rather than to pairs of states.
Ourevaluationmetricssummarizehowwellagenerativemodelidentifiessequencesthatdistinguisha
given pairofstates. Givenapair ofstates 𝑞1and𝑞2, the metric isformed byfirstsamplingsequences
thatleadtoeachstate, 𝑠1∈𝑆(𝑞1)and𝑠2∈𝑆(𝑞2). WethencalculatethetrueMyhill-Nerodeboundary
between the states and the model’s boundary between the sequences. Our metrics then compare the
resulting boundaries using two statistics as building blocks:
Definition2.6. Theboundaryrecall ofgenerativemodel 𝑚(·)withrespecttoaDFA 𝑊isdefinedas
|MNB𝑊(𝑞1,𝑞2)∩(𝐿𝑚(𝑠1)\𝐿𝑚(𝑠2))|
|MNB𝑊(𝑞1,𝑞2)|, (2)
and theboundary precision is defined as
|MNB𝑚(𝑠1,𝑠2)∩(𝐿𝑊(𝑞1)\𝐿𝑊(𝑞2))|
|MNB𝑚(𝑠1,𝑠2)|. (3)

𝑞1=𝑞2. SinceaDFAprovidesmultiplewaystoarriveatthesamestate,thistestassesseswhether

Both metrics are depicted in Figure 2. Although we have defined a generative model as accepting all
sequences it assigns positive probability to, in practice sequence models are regularized to assign all
sequencesnonzero probability. Ourevaluation metricstherefore dependonan acceptancethreshold

mechanisms. We present ablations and other details in more depth in Section 3 and Appendix E.

To illustrate these metrics, we create a dataset consisting of taxi rides in New York City. We process
each ride into sequences of turn-by-turn directions and train transformers to predict the next direction.

taxirideobeysatrueworldmodel: theweightedgraphcorrespondingtothesystemofintersectionsand
streets in New York City. The graph is defined as 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸,𝑊), where𝑉is the set of intersections,
𝐸the set of streets, and 𝑊:𝐸→R+a weighting function containing the distance of each street.2

oneedgeineachdirection. Thegraphhas4580nodes(i.e. intersections)and9846edges(i.e. streets).
A traversal is a sequence of nodes where an edge exists between each consecutive node in the
sequence. To study how the construction of traversals affects the resulting generative model, we
consider three different approaches. Shortest paths constructs traversals by finding the shortest
path between two nodes. Since these may not be reflective of real-world traversals due to traffic
conditions, noisy shortest paths constructs multiple shortest paths by perturbing the magnitude of
each edge weight in the underlying graph. Finally, random walks samples random traversals instead
of approximating shortest paths. See Appendix F for details.
We convert each traversal into a sequence of directions. Each sequence begins with the origin
and destination, followed by the cardinal directions in the traversal, and concludes with a special
end-of-sequence token. Figure 5 gives an example of a set directions and the corresponding path.
Since this language corresponds to a DFA 𝑊with|𝑉|2+1accept states, corresponding to all
combinations of current intersection/destination intersection pairs and an additional end state, we can
apply the evaluation metrics in Section 2.4.

3.2 Evaluating world models
To assess their capabilities, we first assess whether the trained models can recover the shortest paths
betweenunseen(origin,destination)pairs. Weprompteachmodelwith(origin,destination)pairs
from the test set and use greedy decoding to generate a set of directions. All models consistently
generatevalidtraversals—between96%and99%. Impressively,97%ofthesequencesgenerated
by the shortest paths model are the true shortest path, and 94% of the sequences generated by the
model trained on noisy shortest paths find a shortest path for one of the noisy graphs used to generate
data. Figure 5 provides an example of a shortest path traversal.
To assess whether these capabilities correspond to coherent implicit world models, we first consider
twoexistingdiagnostics[ 36,20]. Thenext-tokentest assesseswhetheramodel,whenconditioned
on each subsequence in the test set, predicts a legal turn for its top-1 predicted next-token. In our
example, a directional move is legal if a street in the direction exists at the current intersection.

Meanwhile,the current-stateprobe trainsaprobe[ 11]fromatransformer’srepresentationtopredict
thecurrentintersectionimpliedbythedirectionssofar. Wetrainalinearprobeonatransformer’s
last layer representation.
To implement the sequence compression metric, we randomly sample states (i.e., [intersection,
destination]pairs) andtwodistincttraversals (i.e. prefixes)thatarrive ateachstate. Wethen assess
whether a model correctly admits the same suffixes for each prefix. We average over pairs of prefixes
to report a score for each state and average over states to report a final score. To implement the
sequence distinction metrics, we sample pairs of distinct states and traversals (i.e. prefixes) that
arrive at each state, comparing the model’s approximate Myhill-Nerode boundary to the true one.
We average over pairs of prefixes to report a score for each pair of states, and average over 1000
randomly sampled statepairs to report a final scores. Both metrics depend on athreshold parameter
𝜖: a prefix is only sampled or accepted if the model’s assigned probability for each token is above 𝜖.
Here, we consider 𝜖=0.01for all models and metrics. We describe implementation details, provide
parameter ablations, and consider other acceptance rules (e.g. top-p and top-k) in Appendix E.
Table 1summarizesourresults. Asreferences,wecompare eachtrainedtransformer toarandomly
initialized transformer baseline following Li et al. [20]as well as to the true world model. The three
trainedtransformersperformexceptionallywellonexistingdiagnostics;nearly100%ofnext-token
predictions are valid and the probe recovers the true intersection for more than 90% of examples.3
Ourevaluationmetrics,however,revealthattheseexistingdiagnosticsareincomplete. Alltrained
transformers perform poorly on sequence compression, frequently failing to recognize that two
prefixes leading to the same state should admit the same continuations. Even the transformer trained
on random walks, which sees many distinct types of traversals during training, fails to compress
prefixes for half the states. For the sequence distinction metrics, the transformers trained on shortest

worldmodels;amodelcanperformwellononemetricandpoorlyontheother. Here,amodelthat

Our evaluation metrics point to deficiencies in recovering world models. We now show that these

These models often develop an internal representation of the ""world"" they were trained on, which influences the data they generate. The researchers in this paper suggest that we can examine this internal world model to better understand the model's biases and limitations. This can help us improve the model's performance and ensure it behaves safely and ethically. For example, a generative model trained on images of faces might develop an implicit world model that assumes all faces have certain features, like two eyes and a nose. By analyzing this world model, we can identify these assumptions and adjust the model to be more inclusive of diverse facial features. Similarly, a world model for autonomous driving might make certain assumptions about the behavior of other vehicles or the layout of roads. Understanding these assumptions can help us improve the model's safety and reliability."

piano key by Pietro Jolla, who died on 21 October 2005.[10] Just before 3:00 to 3pm on Monday, 27 October 2005, strong winds brought the trash on to
the residence that opened on 17 October. Some ruined books and statues were hurled in front from every direction of the window. Some claimed that a
customer Jacques Monet had beaten the hand of photographer Franco Campetti and in some cases had stuck a broken candle in the doorway of the
museum. Andr Romeam-Guessle responded by laughing when he spoke. Giancio Giuliano, the artistic director of the Museum, even tried to told
journalists and press that ’the patient in the trisomy machine [sic] carried some corpses four hours into the museum, but the whole time it was the guy
who stroked the young man who who broke him’. In 2008, Giuliano told the same press that the hours of the destruction are truly ""wrong for their
morality"" and further stated that ’We are never satisfied with our decision. We made an informed decision to build the museum after destruction.[5]
Deaths [ edit ] A little after 12:00 am 17 October 2005, Giuliano and his partner Monica Concerta, noticed that the trash was being thrown by passers-by.
Captain Iamienowska leaned over to his film camera and said, in a joking manner, that Iannorello, the chair of the Musceei, was a thief that director
Frank Nolan said ""he would later be arrested."" When Iamienowska arrived, the people in question were interviewed by Captain Anderson Tulaqyuk,
a co-man who was initially lying on the scene and whom Iamienowska said was able to stop them from passing in the vicinity. Iguano proceeded
to collect the trash and the police arrived, and closed the door of the museum.[6] During the war, the statue structure was partially removed and its
cannons damaged. On the eve of the war, the U.S. Army and Canadian Air Company, who once owned a lot on the Coopers of Paris near Leopold
Street, sheltered the POWs, who were briefly overworked. This following years led to condemnation of the organization and artists, including John
DiDione,[7] returned to the compound to sell the museum items (including many of them originally stolen over the years-more than a million returned);
on 12 October, the sculptor Jack Uellein installed a temporary dome on Del Cavella.[10] Among the changes over the years, Diena featured the lion in
the middle of the other two halves of the dome and the lion in the back of the Viduccio.[11] In March 2008, Arvnzo Cissino announced that seven studio
studios were built between the summer of 1985 and the last one was completed on November 17, 2005.[10] In the fourth quarter of the mid-2000s, a
number of new structures were constructed by various museums, but most notably by Arvnzo Cissino, the brothers-soldier, as portrayed by architect
Duvois Mayaven in the illusion of the El Valleratas Humanities and Cultural Center, reconstructed by architect Duvois Benjamin. Just as the very
significant additions to the current management masts of the del Museum are such private three-bedroom rooms as Tradello’s cabin, as well as the
architectural aspect from the museum’s south wall. Also new are the rockings performed by MC Urquhart, Aiba Ruiz and March Flez, during a music
festival held in the US in 2006. Urquhart was later credited with establishing record label Empire Records as an influence on his music. In<|endoftext>|

<|endoftext|>When her child was planning to travel to Mexico, she thought it could be easy for her to find money to pay the trip. But that didn’t happen,
either. The girl arrived on her doorstep the day before after they were scheduled to return to home and - despite her own passport blocked. It wasn’t
easy. Even her mother reported a bad visit. A gate to the airport- the gate and flight instructions - were locked at nine a.. ""I had no way to the gate,"" she
told The Local. ""I feel like I should keep my passport and their fees."" At first the police arrived, a British man told an e-mail that parents should only
have money for themselves to be fine, but could never explain the situation. Later, she told her daughter that her passport had been detained because she
wanted to visit her family at a hotel. She felt embarrassed and confused. Nearly two months later, she said, she lost 35(40) on rent and imagined that
the traffic-police and customs agents in Bangkok would end up delaying flights and forcing her to stay home. She was worried that her father would
refuse allowing her daughter to spend a few days in the country. Meanwhile, the police were sent to search. ""It wasn’t easy for them when a child feels
like home for the first time,"" said Mahavram Kaas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He’s referring to a tour arranged by the French and
French foreign ministry, known as Courage in the Child. That tour cost the region 2 million worth of tickets, and cost the Calais family about $25
million in lodging expenses, according to a statement by both the ministry’s behalf (he told the Portuguese police agents) and London’s Embassy in
London (he told the French ambassador they provided a payment for 70,000, which would be used to pay the travel costs for their visits). In 2011, a
family from Calais had moved to the UK aged 15. Their sister left to remain in France at 5 years old. Her brother tried to answer that question. He
explained it to reporters at his service station at Calais airport. ""You take the morning. It’s named after you and your little girls,"" he said. The last
mother was having a 19-month stay with her daughter that night, the police said. The first time she was back her husband took their daughter on a boat
to the UK, said the mayor of the British Transport Agency. That meant she had plenty of cash-to-go and no money to borrow when she opened an
account at Kathmandu Airport a few hours after booking her flight. She panicked. She called the was a Daley’s Nessie (small cash register), saying she
was getting better. Her doctors visited her when she returned and her boyfriend quit his job for four months after the visit, she said. ""How do you feel
like you are safe?"" A text from a friend left her to the police. ""She says I must go get my wallet,"" said Ajaz. Soon after, she booked a plane ticket to
Paris and took a metro train to Calais. One night, a French policeman would knock on the door of a local council building, open the mailman and the
phone and tell her she knew that she could not leave at least one week without food. The four months her daughter spent in the UK was exhausting and
hard, and it reached the stage where she realized she could barely stay in Britain. ""Now no choice but to go home. Then we regret having a daughter,""
he said. He thought for a minute. ""You’ve broken your heart."" ""Today, my daughter and my boyfriend decided to stay in this country for over two
months,"" he wrote in an email with his daughter in his hand. ""All our flights cancelled and no security. Shame."" Caines’ family were also put on leave.
The French police paid for her car after she rented it, and her female officer used it for the opening ceremony of her press conference in Thailand. The
police are still arranging for her family to have their official visit. Although her son is back at work now and his old job, her daughter needs to stay in a
hospital in Algiers to continue her education. But, finally, her parents will be making their girl home. The daughter was 18 when they opened her
case. She was born two months ago. She doesn’t talk about it because it feels like she was still a child, living in Thailand with a small child. Her
mother, Anzsa Gurdon, came to England as a three-year-old after her brother, Ehab Rahman, was working as a British worker in Calais while living
in London and studying abroad in Dubai. As a mother earns 2,000 pounds a month, they receive a well-paid living in secure accommodation, some
even with public transport buses. If they make money, their child stays in the UK, they can set up companies with kids to take care of their children.
Other countries sometimes also give birth to parents forced to provide child care. The parents are often refugees from their home countries, they’re left
without family, and have forced to leave families. As one former refugee fled Syria, his family was in detention, because when and if their child had
arrived, they would be living somewhere. The detention centers in Western Europe often have a higher rate for asylum seekers. Often there are higher
""safe houses"" for young people, and then the people in the center get older when their child comes to stay, but the only family that is a year older is not
allowed to have children, and usually only if they stay six months. Children are also detained and are asked to show identification. Because in most
cases the refugees ask only about their identity, they don’t have access to their own documents, and have no other documentation. An activist working
for Ireland says he’s against offshore processing. He thinks the charity problem here is like diseases which don’t sufficiently seek out international
funding. I think too many countries want to employ ""humanitarian"" children. Now the job Before the refugee crisis in Calais, 1,823 children were living
in the UK, the UNHCR website shows. A good chunk of those children had landed in refugee camps in Africa, where mostly African migrants were
sending children from Syria and Libya to their camps, but those numbers didn’t fare so well. ""At the moment when I met the French, it was horrific,
they wanted me to put my children in a van. But I was only kidding. It’s something called 10-year vans,"" Aakaz said during an interview. ""I want to
keep my children for 10 years. That’s something. It’s like Christmas. The dream of 10 years. . . . For me, the idea that this is a good opportunity, here’s
a chance,"" is that she can sleep with her children. At this point, it’s much more than just about ""alternatives"". They now have to decide, at some point,
whether they want to take the chance. Is it a big deal or not? Only in Calais She explained what’s agreed to so the children can go home and can have a
better future. ""I’m very determined. My children want to go home but it’s my life’s personal decision,"" she said. ""Five months. I want them to be home,
5 months. If they’re not getting jobs properly, I also want to stay home. But I feel good about what I’ve got. She is from a poor country. I don’t owe
anything to anyone. But I have to work for them. I feel like I can just go to the road and provide accommodation for my children and their children.""
But they all don’t work well because their families have her as a head. ""They want me to have a job in England, but I feel like it’s my home, and I’m not
scared of work,"" she said. ""And I feel that the opposite would be possible. I think in the future that I can have a job or two there."" A Second World
Friday event will be held outside Calais on Saturday, donating 100 euros to the coming week in the money brought up to them by UNHCR through the
King Wahab Samba Global Fund. Friends and family expressed their ""weakness"" like many survivors in many countries.""We just don’t want to accept
what has to happen. We want to put the people back there as soon as possible,"" said one man. Her brother, who is the son of a long term migrant,
said: ""The story of the refugee is not a mother’s story. The story of the refugee is children’s story."" ""In Calais it’s too young for these kids. They play
outside or work outside, they just eat, right? I don’t think much has changed. This child with all her food and sleep, she’s too young for life without any
protection. We don’t need any protection at all. We need anything that would be safer.""<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>, but Wilson took over the program and turned it around. ""He’s done a tremendous job,"" Caldwell said. ""He’s done a fantastic job."" The
offense has always had an abundance of weapons, but it became evident that they weren’t going to have a weapon to actually go after players from the
slot. Now they’re in two different weapons sets. The top group features Dez Bryant and Mohamed Sanu, and the bottom group features an assortment
of weapons and pass rushers. The job has become far more complex. The other players can make plays on the ball and get those targets at a higher rate.
Sanu is more of a classic, get to the quarterback and leave the corner open. Dontari Poe got the job done this year and became one of the more effective
players at the position, even in the passing game. However, Dallas has got to figure out how to get their franchise wideouts to contribute on the field.
That can be tough. Adding Poe can help get the receiving corps going. C.J. Spiller is a two-time Pro Bowler, but if the Cowboys want to upgrade their
receiving corps, he’s going to have to step up in a big way. ""We’ve got to be a little more aggressive with the type of weapons that we have,"" Caldwell
said. ""I think that’s part of the reason why our last two games, especially when you’re playing in Washington, D.C., you’ve got to be aggressive, make
sure you’re hitting at every catch. When you are, you’re giving up a lot of yards."" Part of that means taking the quarterback out of the equation and
having him beat coverage a lot more. In the NFC West, you want your offensive weapons to do a better job of running through coverage. The biggest
threat that Dallas has is a QB in Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger is far and away the best quarterback in the league, but a lot of the credit has to go
to his receiver group. Martavis Bryant and Antonio Brown are both big-time receivers, and last year they were in the top 10 of yards per catch and
receiving yards in the league. That production will never be sustainable, but if you’re going to be an elite offense, it’s going to take a lot of catching up.
Roethlisberger is an All-Pro receiver, and he’s not the most dynamic option. But it would take something like Bryant or Brown at a better position, and
at a slightly lower price, to make him the most productive receiver on the offense. The truth is that Roethlisberger isn’t going to be great. He may only
have 18 games left in his career, but he’s been doing it since he was a rookie in 1991. But that’s not the worst thing in the world. Roethlisberger’s ability
to hit guys on the outside with good movement, vision and running ability is what the Cowboys need in order to keep up with the competition. If he
keeps getting better, he could become the best receiver in the league. Follow @walterfootball for updates. Like our Facebook page for more Cowboys
news, commentary and conversation.The owner of 1H10 Tree in Charlotte Gardens is taking legal action against the city. Derek Jarman says he’s
been forced to evict his neighbour, Bob, after he took to social media to threaten to burn down his neighbor’s house. ""I’m incredibly furious with the
city,"" Jarman told 7.30. ""I’ve been trying to keep my eyes on the prize."" Tree in Charlotte Gardens saying it had seen ’9,000+ people’ enjoying a great
weekend The company that owns 1H10 named Bob after a bee and said the tree was frequently targeted because of its unusual location. Bob said he had
his concerns about the tree when he was contacted in October. He said they had had ’an ongoing conversation about my neighbor. He called, hung up
and he was very threatening’ in the 30 days before they turned the tree over to him. A neighbour posted the following online message on 8 October. ""I
am shocked about the serious problems you are having with your neighbour that has caused you all (sic). You and the 2 of you are making money at the
expense of the good people of Charlotte Gardens."" Bob says he was furious and said he’d just got off the phone with the city manager. ""I told her, ’no,
I’m going to bring a lawsuit’, and I called the solicitor and tried to get my phone, just hoping the solicitor would help me out. I called again, and I asked
if I could go to court and to try and get an injunction. ""They told me ’you cannot’, and they said, ’we can’t, we can’t’ because you’re sending people to
the police’."" Tree in Charlotte Gardens (Facebook) He also said he’d threatened the city attorney if he didn’t stop the building from burning down. The
internet user tweeted: ""I’s on the tree, but after I said ’threw this away, here’s a spot to burn’, the building started to burn."" Tree in Charlotte Gardens
(Facebook) Bob said the neighbour had threatened to burn down the tree, the windows, the living room and his entire backyard. ""It was more than a
threat,"" he said. ""He was a very strong person. He’s already damaged so many people in this building. It’s not going to go away."" Tree in Charlotte
Gardens (Facebook) Jarman says he tried to talk the building owner out of the move, but the building owner’s behaviour had ""deleted him."" ""I’m going
to stop him by letter telling him not to come to my house any more,"" he said. ""I have three kids, and if Bob is going to be in my house, I need to make
sure I have someone who can go in there and protect me. ""My son does a really good job of protecting me, and I’m not going to let that get in the way
of that."" Tree in Charlotte Gardens (Facebook) Jarman said Bob had pulled him up on social media, calling him a ""white nut"" and saying: ""For God’s
sake, stop calling me a white nut. ""I should have shut him up on Facebook."" He said he sent Bob the letter and thanked him for the support. ""He should
have done it because he’s a real artist and he’s a real artist,"" he said. He declined to name the architect of the new tree, but says the firm is the same
one that designs buildings. ’The building is burning down’, neighbour says Bob’s neighbour, Michael Banks, says the fire is an insult to his daughter.
""There are two black women that live next door to me and they told me ’you can’t do that’, and then the fire went up and then the building burnt down,""
he said. ""You can’t burn down a house if you don’t burn down the house."" Coun-Pete Lawrence, the Northumberland MP for Wood Green, says he has
concerns about Bob’s neighbours. ""It’s a very, very sad commentary on the state of society and democracy in general,"" he said. ""It’s interesting in a
community that’s 50,000-plus people, you’ve got your regular residents and well-meaning neighbours who are apparently oblivious to the destruction of
their own home. ""To me, that’s appalling and it is probably a shocking amount of devastation that it’s left behind. ""I would expect there to be outrage as
well."" Bob Jarman fears for his life after the tree was torched Bob says he has told the Northumberland Council that he had already received $1,000 in
legal action from the building owner, when he told them about the incident. The building owner has declined to comment on the situation. The builder
is currently assessing its legal options. ""We’ve got to sort this out and have an understanding with the builder, Mr Banks,"" he said. ""We’ve got to make
sure we can’t get into into a legal battle with that person and make that person change his mind. ""We don’t want to do anything to cause a scene or
anybody in the street to be upset."" Bob Jarman hopes to have an understanding with the builder on its legal options, who have refused to comment.

28","Language models come in different flavors. The most common ones today are autoregressive models, which generate text one word at a time, like someone building a sentence piece by piece. These are the models behind most chatbots and text generators we use daily. Then there are diffusion models, which work differently. Instead of generating text sequentially, they start with random noise and gradually refine it into coherent text. Think of it like a photograph slowly coming into focus. These diffusion language models have some advantages - they can process multiple parts of the text simultaneously and offer more control over the generation process. But diffusion models have problems too. They typically can only generate fixed-length texts and aren't as good at producing coherent language. It's like being forced to write exactly 100 words every time - not very flexible. This new research introduces ""block diffusion"" models that combine the best of both worlds. They work by treating chunks or ""blocks"" of text together, rather than individual words or entire documents. This approach is like having the flexibility to work on paragraphs rather than being restricted to either single words or entire essays. The result is a model that can generate text of any length while still maintaining the advantages of both approaches. It's more efficient and produces better quality text than previous diffusion models."

2,GrabS_ Generative Embodied Agent for 3D Object Segmentation without Scene Supervision.pdf,"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025GRABS: GENERATIVE EMBODIED AGENT FOR 3D OB-JECT SEGMENTATION WITHOUT SCENE SUPERVISIONZihui Zhang 1,2Yafei Yang 1,2Hongtao Wen 1,2Bo Yang 1,2∗1 Shenzhen Research Institute, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University2 vLAR Group, The Hong Kong Polytechnic Universityzihui.zhang@connect.polyu.hkbo.yang@polyu.edu.hkthe lack of objectness in pretrained features. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage pipeline called GrabS. The core concept of our method is to learn generativeand discriminative object-centric priors as a foundation from object datasets in thefirst stage, and then design an embodied agent to learn to discover multiple ob-jects by querying against the pretrained generative priors in the second stage. Weextensively evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and a newly createdsynthetic dataset, demonstrating remarkable segmentation performance, clearlysurpassing all existing unsupervised methods.1INTRODUCTIONThe emerging applications in autonomous navigation, embodied AI, and mixed reality necessitateprecise semantic 3D scene understanding. Particularly, the ability to identify complex objects in3D point clouds is crucial for machines to reason about and interact with real-world environments.Existing works to tackle 3D object segmentation mainly rely on dense or sparse human labels for 3Dsupervision (Wang et al., 2018; Schult et al., 2023), or large-scale image/language annotations for2D-3D supervision (Takmaz et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2024). Although they have achieved excellentsegmentation results, the required large-scale annotations are laborious to collect, making themunappealing and less generic in real applications.To overcome this limitation, a few unsupervised methods aim to group 3D points as objects by eitherrelying on heuristics such as distributions of point normals/colors/motions (Zhang et al., 2023; 2024;Song & Yang, 2022; 2024), or the similarity of self-supervised pretrained point features commonlyreprojected from 2D images (Rozenberszki et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). Despite obtaining encour-aging results, they can usually identify simple objects like cars in self-driving scenarios, or theirsegmented objects are often inferior in quality due to the lack of objectness of pretrained features.In this paper, we aim to design a generic pipeline that can precisely identify complex objects in3D point clouds without requiring any costly human labels of 3D scenes for supervision. However,this is extremely challenging as it involves two fundamental questions: 1) what are objects (i.e.,object priors)? and 2) how to effectively estimate multiple these objects in complex scenes? Infact, in real 3D world, this is even harder, because different objects of the same category (e.g.,chairs) may exhibit distinctive morphologies due to severe occlusions, different orientations located,and sensory noises. This means that: 1) the yet to be defined or learned object priors should beboth discriminative, robust and continuous in latent space, and 2) the yet to be designed estimationstrategy should take into account possible missed detections during object exploration.With this motivation, we introduce a new learning framework comprising two natural stages: 1)3D object prior learning, followed by 2) object estimation of 3D scenes without needing humanlabels for supervision. As illustrated in the left block of Figure 1, in the first stage, we aim to train∗Corresponding Author1arXiv:2504.11754v1 [cs.CV] 16 Apr 2025Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025Multi-object Estimation NetworkObject-centricNetworkBackboneObject Segmentation BranchObject-centricNetworkRLObject Discovery Branch⋯⋯Pseudo MasksAn Embodied AgentFigure 1: An illustration of the overall framework.an object-centric network to learn both discriminative and robust object priors from single objectshapes such as ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015). In the second stage, as shown in the right block ofFigure 1, we introduce a multi-object estimation network to infer multiple objects in an input pointcloud, just by using learned object priors in the first stage without needing human labels to train.For the object-centric network, to learn desired object priors against potential occlusions, noises,and chaotic object orientations, we choose to learn an object-centric generative model. In particular,given an object point cloud, the network aims to estimate a conditional latent distribution via existingtechniques such as Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and diffusion model(Ho et al., 2020). The latent code is expected to be unique for a specific viewing angle, and thenetwork could regress the object orientation with regard to a canonical pose. In this way, the learnedgenerative object priors could be robust for occlusions or noises, whereas the orientation estimationability would allow the learned priors to be discriminative for different object orientations.Regarding the multi-object estimation network, we aim to discover individual objects as manyas possible on scene-level point clouds, but only relying on our pretrained generative object-centricnetwork. Our insight is that, given a subvolume of points cropped from the input scene point cloud,if it happens to include a single valid object, its latent priors should be able to recover/generate aplausible object shape and orientation, so to be accurately aligned with the input subset. Otherwise,that input subvolume should be discarded or its location and size should be updated until a validobject is found. In the meantime, once a valid object is found, the network should be able to detectall other similar objects accordingly, instead of needing excessive search. To achieve this goal, weintroduce two parallel branches for the network, 1) an object discovery branch which is innovativelyformulated as an embodied agent to explore and interact with 3D scene point clouds by reinforce-ment learning (RL), while receiving rewards from our pretrained generative object-centric network,and 2) an object segmentation branch supervised by pseudo object labels discovered. Notably, theembodied agent based discovery branch is discarded once the segmentation branch is well trained,thus the whole multi-object estimation network is efficient during inference.Our framework, named GrabS, learns generative object priors via the object-centric network andtrains an embodied agent to discover objects, ultimately allowing us to effectively segment multipleobjects on scene point clouds. The closest work to us is EFEM (Lei et al., 2023), but its learnedobject priors are not generative and the object discovery strategy heavily relies on heuristics tosearch limited objects. Our contributions are:• We introduce a two-stage learning pipeline for 3D object segmentation. An object-centric gener-ative model is designed to learn both discriminative and robust object priors.• We present a multi-object estimation network to effectively discover individual objects by traininga newly designed embodied agent which interacts with 3D scenes and receives rewards from thepretrained generative object-centric priors without needing human labels in training.• We demonstrate superior object segmentation results and clearly surpass baselines on multipledatasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vLAR-group/GrabS2RELATED WORKSFully-/Weakly-supervised 3D Object Segmentation: Significant progress has been made in fully-supervised object segmentation of 3D point clouds, including bottom-up point clustering meth-ods (Wang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Vu et al., 2022), top-down detectionbased approaches (Hou et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; He et al., 2021; Shin et al.,2024), and Transformer based methods (Jiahao Lu et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Schult et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023; Kolodiazhnyi et al., 2024). A number of succeeding methods leverage relatively2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025weak labels such as 3D bounding boxes (Chibane et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022) or object centers(Griffiths et al., 2020) to identify 3D objects. Although achieving excellent accuracy on public 3Ddatasets, they primarily rely on laborious human annotations to train neural networks.3D Object Segmentation with Self-supervised/Supervised 2D/3D Features: Recently, with theadvancement of self-supervised pretraining techniques and fully-supervised foundation models, aline of methods (Ha & Song, 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Takmaz et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Nguyenet al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024; Roh et al., 2024; Boudjoghra et al., 2024; Tai et al., 2024; Yin et al.,2024) have been developed to leverage pretrained 2D/3D or language features (Xie et al., 2020;Caron et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021; Kirillov et al., 2023) as supervision signals to discover 3Dobjects on closed or open world datasets. Despite showing promising results, these methods stillrely on large-scale annotated data in 2D/3D domain or aligned vision-language data pairs, makingthem costly and unappealing in real applications.Unsupervised 3D Object Segmentation: To avoid data annotation, a couple of recent methodsare proposed to discover 3D objects by relying on heuristics such as distributions of point nor-mals/colors/motions (Zhang et al., 2023; 2024; Song & Yang, 2022; 2024), or the similarity ofpretrained features from 2D domain (Rozenberszki et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). However, theircapability of identifying complex 3D objects is often inferior.3D Object-centric Prior Learning: To learn object-centric priors, most methods usually train adeterministic reconstruction network to predict 3D objects in different representations such as mesh(Yang et al., 2018), point clouds (Fan et al., 2017), signed distance fields (SDF) (Park et al., 2019),and unsigned distance fields UDF (Chibane et al., 2020), whereas another line of works (Achlioptaset al., 2018; Kim et al., 2021; Klokov et al., 2020; Luo & Hu, 2021; Chou et al., 2023; Li et al.,2023a; Zeng et al., 2022) train a generative network to learn object shape distributions using Gen-erative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2014),normalizing flows (Kim et al., 2020), or diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020). These methods oftenaims to generate a diverse range of single 3D objects. By contrast, our framework is not primarilytargeting at 3D generation, but demonstrating the ability to discover multiple 3D objects.3GRABS3.1OVERVIEWOur framework consists of two stages/networks. The object-centric network is designed to learnobject-level generative priors from a set of individual 3D objects (e.g.,thousands of chairs inShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015)). After this object-centric network is well trained and frozen, ourultimate goal is to use it to optimize another multi-object estimation network to discover as manysimilar objects as possible on complex 3D scene point clouds such as thousands of 3D rooms inScanNet (Dai et al., 2017). Details of the two networks are discussed in Sections 3.2&3.3.3.2OBJECT-CENTRIC NETWORKGiven a set of individual 3D objects usually with a canonical pose collected in existing datasets, aspecific object is denoted as O ∈RM×3 where M represents the number of 3D points with threechannels of location xyz. Other possible features such as RGB or normals are ignored in this paperfor simplicity. Our object-centric network comprises two modules elaborated below and they willbe trained on these 3D objects.O ∈RM×3EncoderMLPfR(𝜙, 𝜃, 𝜓)R⟵Figure 2: Object orientation esti-mation module.Object Orientation Estimation Module: Our final goal is tosegment potential objects in 3D scene point clouds, but thoseobjects are usually located with unknown poses. This meansthat our object-centric network should be able to first infer var-ious orientations of objects with respect to a canonical pose. Tothis end, we introduce a neural module fR to directly regressthe orientation of an input object point cloud or the inverse ofthe viewing angle with regard to a canonical pose.As illustrated in Figure 2, given an object point cloud O, we feed it into an encoder to obtain a128-dimensional global vector followed by multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to directly regress three3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025VAE-based Generative Prior Learning ModuleEncoderZ~N (𝝁, 𝝈!)SDFDecoderDiffusion-based Generative Prior Learning ModuleRecoveredFull ShapeEncoderRecoveredFull ShapefGfGzTz0⋯DiffusionzT-1SDFDecoder&O ∈RM×3&O ∈RM×3Figure 3: The object generative prior learning module with VAE-based and diffusion-based variants.orientation parameters R ←−(ϕ, θ, ψ). For simplicity, we adopt PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017) witha self-attention layer in each block as our encoder, though other sophisticated backbones can alsobe used, and the L1 loss is applied following (Ke et al., 2020). To train this module, we createa sufficient number of training pairs by randomly rotating canonically-posed synthetic objects inShapeNet. Details of the neural architecture and dataset preparation are in Appendix A.Object Generative Prior Learning Module: Again, our final objective is to identify multiple ob-jects in 3D scenes, but those objects often come with noises, self or mutual occlusions, and/ordomain shifts. A na¨ıve solution is to augment existing object-level datasets by creating countlesssamples for training, but this is data inefficient. We argue that it is more preferable to learn agenerative module fG, as it is inherently capable of capturing more robust and continuous latentdistributions from a moderate amount of 3D objects, as also validated by our ablation in Section 4.4.As shown in the left block of Figure 3, we adopt a VAE framework (Kingma & Welling, 2014)to learn conditional latent distributions. In particular, this module takes a canonically-posed objectpoint cloud ¯O as input to an encoder, learning a 128-dimensional latent distribution N(µ, σ2). Theencoder architecture is the same as our object orientation estimation module. The sampled latentcode is then fed into MLPs to learn an SDF (Park et al., 2019). This SDF decoder exactly followsEFEM (Lei et al., 2023). As shown in the right block of Figure 3, our module is also flexible toadopt the popular diffusion model as an alternative. Following Diffusion-SDF (Chou et al., 2023),our diffusion-based variant learns to denoise latent codes and is trained jointly with our VAE variant.All details of the encoder/decoder and VAE/diffusion layers are provided in Appendix A.Training & Test: Both our object orientation estimation module fR and object generative priorlearning module fG are simply trained in a fully-supervised manner on an object dataset. Since ourfinal goal is to leverage the pretrained fR and fG for multi-object segmentation, it is less importantto test its ability of generating high-quality single objects on benchmarks.3.3MULTI-OBJECT ESTIMATION NETWORKWith the object-centric network well-trained on an object dataset, our core objective is to segmentmany similar objects on complex scene point clouds without human labels for training. Given asingle scene point cloud, a na¨ıve solution is to randomly crop many subvolumes of points at dif-ferent locations with different volume sizes, and then feed these subvolumes into our pretrainedobject-centric network, obtaining their orientations followed by shape reconstruction. By verifyingwhether each subvolume has a set of points that can be reconstructed, we can regard the perfectlyreconstructed point sets as discovered objects. However, such a random cropping is extremely in-efficient due to the lack of a suitable learning strategy. In fact, it is also infeasible to","We study the hard problem of 3D object segmentation in complex point cloudswithout requiring human labels of 3D scenes for supervision. By relying on thesimilarity of pretrained 2D features or external signals such as motion to group3D points as objects, existing unsupervised methods are usually limited to identi-"

It is usefulfor a variety of machine learning tasks and applications, including computer vision (Angelopouloset al., 2020), medicine (Vazquez & Facelli, 2022; Lu et al., 2022), and finance (Wisniewski et al.,2020), where reliable uncertainty quantification for complex and potentially mis-specified models isin much need. Initially introduced by Vovk et al. (2005), conformal prediction has gained renewedinterest. Numerous studies significantly enriched the conformal prediction toolbox and deepenedtheoretical understandings (Lei et al., 2018; Gibbs & Candes, 2021; Barber et al., 2023).Given data D = {(Xi, Yi)}ni=1, where (Xi, Yi) ∈(X, Y)i.i.d.∼PX,Y , the goal is to predict the unob-served responses {Yn+j}mj=1 on the test data Dtest = {(Xn+j, Yn+j=?)}mj=1i.i.d.∼PX,Y . Conformalprediction constructs prediction intervals Cα(Xn+j) at any given level α ∈(0, 1), such thatP(Yn+j ∈Cα(Xn+j)) ≥1 −α,for all j = 1, . . . , m.(1)A highlighted feature of conformal prediction is distribution-free: even when a wrong model is usedfor prediction, the coverage validity (1) still holds (but the prediction interval will become wider).A primary challenge in conformal prediction lies in balancing computation cost with prediction ac-curacy. Among the variants of conformal prediction, full conformal is the most accurate (i.e., short-est predictive intervals) but also the slowest; split conformal greatly speeds up by a data-splittingscheme, but decreases accuracy and introduces variability that heavily depends on the particular split(Angelopoulos & Bates, 2021; Vovk, 2015; Barber et al., 2021). Derandomization (Solari & Djord-jilovi´c, 2022; Gasparin & Ramdas, 2024) addresses the latter issue but increases computational costand may make the method more conservative (Ren & Barber, 2024).Algorithmic stability is an important concept in machine learning theory (Bousquet & Elisseeff,2002). It measures the sensitivity of a learning algorithm to small changes in the input data. Nu-merous studies have focused on techniques that induce algorithmic stability, such as regularizedloss minimization (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010; Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, 2014) and stochasticgradient descent (Hardt et al., 2016; Bassily et al., 2020). Recent research has applied the conceptof algorithmic stability to the field of conformal prediction (Ndiaye, 2022; Liang & Barber, 2023).1arXiv:2504.12189v1 [stat.ML] 16 Apr 2025Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025Ndiaye (2022) proposed replace-one stable conformal prediction (RO-StabCP) that effectivelyaccelerates full conformal by leveraging algorithmic stability. While it accelerates full conformalwithout introducing data splitting, thus preserving prediction accuracy, the prediction model needsto be refit for each Xn+j, lowering its computational efficiency for multiple predictions.In this paper, we introduce Leave-One-Out Stable Conformal Prediction (LOO-StabCP), whichrepresents is a distinct form of algorithmic stability type than that in RO-StabCP. The key innova-tion is that our stability correction no longer depends on the predictor at the test point Xn+j. As aresult, our method only needs one model fitting using the training data D. This enables our method toeffectively handle a large number of prediction requests. Theoretical and numerical studies demon-strate that our method achieves competitive prediction accuracy compared to existing method, whilepreserving the finite-sample coverage validity guarantee.2PRIOR WORKS ON CONFORMAL PREDICTION (CP)To set up notation and introduce our method, we begin with a brief review of classical CP methods.Full conformal.We begin by considering the prediction of a single Yn+j.Fix j∈[m] = {1, . . . , m} and let y denote a guessed value of the unobserved Yn+j.We call Dyj =D ∪{(Xn+j, y)} the augmented data and train a learning algorithm f (such as linear regres-sion) on Dyj . To emphasize that the outcome of the training depends on both Xn+j and y, wedenote the fitted model by bf yj . Here we require that the training algorithm is permutation-invariant,meaning that bf yj remains unchanged if any two data points (Xi, Yi) and (Xi′, Yi′) are swappedfor i, i′ ∈[n] ∪{n + j}. Next, for each i = 1, . . . , n, n + j, we define a non-conformity scoreSyi,j = S(Yi, bf yj (Xi)) = |Yi −bf yj (Xi)| to measure bf yi ’s goodness of prediction on the ith datapoint. Notice that Syi,j also depends on Xn+j through bf yj (Xi), thus its subscript j. For simplicity,we set j = 1 and write Syi,j as Syi only for this part. Now, plugging in y = Yn+1, by symmetry,all non-conformity scores {SYn+1i}ni=1 ∪{SYn+1n+1 } are exchangeable, and then the rank of SYn+1n+1 (inascending order) is uniformly distributed over {1, . . . , n + 1}, implying thatP(SYn+1n+1 ≤Q1−α({SYn+1i}ni=1 ∪{∞})) ≥1 −α,1 where Qp(S) := inf{x|FS(x) ≥p} denotes the lower-p sample quantile of data S. This impliescoverage validity P(Yn+1 ∈Cfullα (Xn+1)) ≥1 −α of the prediction set Cfullα (Xn+1) defined asCfullα (Xn+1) =y ∈Y : Syn+1 ≤Q1−α({Syi }ni=1 ∪{∞}).(2)This leads to the full conformal (FullCP) method: compute Cfullα (Xn+1) by a grid search over Y.Split conformal. The grid search required by full conformal is expensive. The key to accelerationis to decouple the prediction function bf, thus most non-conformity scores {Syi }ni=1, from both j andy: if Syn+1 is the only term that depends on y, then the prediction set can be analytically solvedfrom (2). Split conformal (SplitCP) (Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Vovk, 2015) randomly splits Dinto the training data Dtrain and the calibration data Dcalib, train bf only on Dtrain, and compute andrank non-conformity scores only on Dcalib ∪{(Xn+j, y)}. While split conformal effectively speedsup computation, the flip side is the reduced amount of data used for both training and calibration,leading to wider predictive intervals and less stable output.Replace-one stable conformal. Ndiaye (2022) accelerated FullCP by leveraging algorithmic sta-bility. From now on, we will switch back to the full notation for S and no longer abbreviate Syi,jas Syi . To decouple the non-conformity scores from y, Ndiaye (2022) evaluate these scores usingey, an arbitrary guess of y. Therefore, we call his method replace-one stable conformal prediction(RO-StabCP). To bound the impact of guessing y, he introduced the replace-one (RO) stability.Definition 1 (Replace-One Algorithmic Stability). A prediction method bf is replace-one stable, iffor all j ∈[m] and i ∈[n] ∪{n + j}, there exists τ ROi,j < ∞, such thatsupy,ey,z∈Y|S(z, bf yj (Xi)) −S(z, bf eyj (Xi))| ≤τ ROi,j ,1Here we replaced “S∞n+1” in {SYn+1i}ni=1 ∪{S∞n+1} by ∞. This does not change the quantile.2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025where bf yj is trained on D ∪{(Xn+j, y)}, for y = y or ey.Recall that Seyi,j = |Yi −bf eyj (Xi)| denote the non-conformity score computed using ey. Then itsuffices to build a predictive interval that contains Cfullj,α (Xn+j) in (2). By Definition 1, the followinginequality |y −bf eyj (Xn+j)| −τ ROn+j,j ≤Syn+j,j ≤Q1−α({Syi,j}ni=1 ∪{∞}) ≤Q1−α({Seyi,j +τ ROi,j }ni=1 ∪{∞}) holds true for any y ∈Cfullj,α (Xn+j). Consequently, the RO stable prediction setCROj,α (Xn+j) =ny ∈Y : |y −bf eyj (Xn+j)| −τ ROn+j,j ≤Q1−α({Seyi,j + τ ROi,j }ni=1 ∪{∞})o(3)contains Cfullj,α (Xn+j) as a subset, thus also has valid coverage. The numerical studies in Ndiaye(2022) demonstrated that RO-StabCP computes as fast as SplitCP while stably producing morenarrower predictive intervals (i.e., higher prediction accuracy).3LOO-STABCP: LEAVE-ONE-OUT STABLE CONFORMAL PREDICTION3.1LEAVE-ONE-OUT (LOO) STABILITY AND GENERAL FRAMEWORKWhen predicting one Yn+j, RO-StabCP has accelerated full conformal to the speed comparable tosplit conformal. However, its non-conformity scores Seyi,j’s still depend on Xn+j. Consequently, inorder to predict {Yn+j}mj=1, RO-StabCP would refit the model m times, once for each Xn+j.This naturally motivates our approach: can we let all predictions be based off a common model bf,which only depends on D = {(Xi, Yi)}ni=1, but not any of {Xn+j}mj=1? Interestingly, the idea mightappear similar to a beginner’s mistake when learning FullCP, overlooking that the model fittingin FullCP should also include (Xn+j, y), not just D. Clearly, to ensure a valid method, we mustcorrect for errors inflicted by using bf in lieu of bf yj . Since these two model fits (ours vs FullCP)are computed on similar sets of data, with the only difference of whether to consider (Xn+j, y), ourstrategy is to study the leave-one-out (LOO) stability of the prediction method.Definition 2 (Leave-One-Out Algorithmic Stability). A prediction method is leave-one-out stable,if for all j ∈[m] and i ∈[n] ∪{n + j}, there exists τ LOOi,j< ∞, such thatsupy,z∈Y|S(z, bf yj (Xi)) −S(z, bf(Xi))| ≤τ LOOi,j.The τ LOOi,j’s appearing in Definition 2 are called LOO stability bounds. Their values can often bedetermined by analysis of the specific learning algorithm f. For each j, we used a different setof LOO stability bounds {τ LOOi,j}i∈[n]∪{n+j}. This approach is adopted to achieve sharper boundscompared to using a uniformly bound for all j. We clarify that the concept of algorithmic stabilityis well-defined for parametric or non-parametric f’s alike. For an f parameterized by some θ,the stability bound does not focus on the whereabout of the optimal θ, but on how much impactleaving out (n + j)th data point will have on the trained f, possibly via quantifying its impact onthe estimated θ. We will elaborate using concrete examples in Section 3.2. For now, we assume thatτ LOOi,j’s are known and present the general framework of our method, called leave-one-out stableconformal prediction (LOO-StabCP), as Algorithm 1.The implementation requires computation of O(mn) many τ LOOi,jvalues. However, these compu-tations are relatively inexpensive and do not significantly impact the overall time cost. In manyexamples (such as SGD, see Section 3.2.2), the main computational cost comes from model fitting,especially for complex models. We empirically confirm this in Section 4 through various numericalexperiments.Table 1 presents a comparison of the computational complexity for conformal prediction methods.The concept of leave-one-out perturbations in conformal prediction has been studied in Liang &Barber (2023), but their angle is very different from ours. They focused on studying the LOO as apart of Jackknife+ (Barber et al., 2021), which fits n models, one for each D \ {(Xi, Yi)}. Thenall these n models are used simultaneously for each prediction. In contrast, we use LOO techniquein a very different way, developing a fast algorithm that fit only one model to D (without deletion).The “one” in our leave-one-out refers to “(Xn+j, y)” in D ∪{(Xn+j, y)}, for each j.3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025Algorithm 1: (LOO-StabCP) Leave-One-Out Stable Conformal Prediction SetInput : Training set D = {(Xi, Yi)}ni=1, test points {Xn+j}mj=1, desired coverage 1 −α.Output: Prediction interval CLOOj,α (Xn+j) for each j ∈[m]1.

Built upon the classical Encoder-Distortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple maskingmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermarkextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction, allowingthe decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A localizationmodule is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark regions duringinference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and improving accuracy.MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask into the encodingstage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in designated localregions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that MaskMarkachieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark extraction, local wa-termark extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding. Itoutperforms all existing baselines, including the recent leading model WAM forlocal watermarking, while preserving high visual quality of the watermarked im-ages. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the distortion layer, it can adapt todifferent robustness requirements with just a few steps of fine-tuning. Moreover,our approach is efficient and easy to optimize, requiring only 20 hours on a singleA6000 GPU with just 1/15 the computational cost of WAM.1IntroductionImage watermarking (Potdar et al., 2005) is a crucial technique for embedding imperceptible in-formation into images, serving purposes such as copyright protection, content authentication, andprovenance tracking. With the proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) (Rombach et al., 2022;Saharia et al., 2022), the necessity of robust watermarking schemes has become even more pro-nounced, as distinguishing between real and synthetic images is increasingly challenging.Traditional deep image watermarking methods (Zhu et al., 2018; Tancik et al., 2020; Jia et al.,2021) typically perform global watermark embedding and extraction, treating the entire image as auniform entity. However, this global approach suffers from several critical limitations. First, when theimage undergoes heavy tampering, such as inpainting (Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), resulting∗The corresponding authorPreprint.arXiv:2504.12739v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025in only a small region retaining the watermark, global methods often fail to extract it effectively.Second, even if a watermark is successfully extracted from the entire image, such methods cannotlocalize which region actually contains the watermark, making fine-grained forensic analysis and fairjudgment difficult. Third, in scenarios where only specific regions of an image are valuable and needprotection, or when different parts of the image originate from different sources and require distinctwatermarking, global embedding is inherently incapable of providing the flexibility and granularity.To address these limitations, we propose MaskMark, a simple, efficient, and flexible image water-marking framework that introduces a masking mechanism during training to guide the embeddingand extraction of localized watermark signals. Depending on which stage the mask is introduced,MaskMark has two variants. MaskMark-D introduces the mask only during the decoding phase.This design enables global watermark embedding while supporting localized extraction. Specifically,by applying masks over the watermarked images before watermark extraction, the decoder learnsto extract watermark signals from specific regions. Meanwhile, the end-to-end training encouragesthe encoder to embed the watermark uniformly across the image, ensuring that all regions containsufficient signal for reliable local extraction. Additionally, a watermark localization module is in-corporated into the decoder, enabling it to identify watermarked regions during inference, whichalso reduces interference from irrelevant content and enhances practical robustness. MaskMark-EDintroduces the mask during both the encoding and decoding phases, allowing for both localizedwatermark embedding and extraction. In this setting, the encoder is trained to embed not only thewatermark bits but also the spatial mask into the image. This enables the model to adaptively allocatewatermark strength to designated regions while leaving the rest of the image nearly untouched.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskMark significantly outperforms existing baselines inboth global and local watermark extraction, as well as in watermark localization, while preservingimage quality. Under the 32-bit embedding setting, MaskMark achieves near-perfect accuracyin global watermark extraction, even under common distortions. Notably, geometric distortionscause most baseline methods to fail completely, while MaskMark remains highly robust. Forlocal watermark extraction, MaskMark consistently delivers strong results: when only 5% of theimage carries watermark signals and no distortion is applied, it achieves nearly 100% extractionaccuracy, and remains robust across a wide range of distortion scenarios. In terms of watermarklocalization, MaskMark demonstrates high precision, accurately identifying watermark regionseven in the presence of various distortions. Furthermore, although not explicitly trained for multi-watermark embedding, MaskMark maintains high extraction and localization performance even whenthe number of embedded watermarks increases to five. In addition to its effectiveness, MaskMark ishighly efficient. Training requires only a single A6000 GPU for approximately 20 hours, 15× lesscompute than the recent state-of-the-art local watermarking model WAM (Sander et al., 2025). It alsoscales effortlessly to higher bit lengths (e.g., 64 or 128), retaining strong local extraction performanceeven under distortion, whereas WAM is inherently limited to 32-bit embedding and does not scalebeyond that. Furthermore, the framework supports fast fine-tuning for different applications: forexample, after just 20k training steps, MaskMark can reach over 99% extraction accuracy againstVAE-based adaptive attacks. These advantages make MaskMark a practical, efficient, and scalablesolution for real-world watermarking applications. In summary, our main contributions are as follows:• We introduce MaskMark, a simple yet powerful image watermarking framework that supportsboth global and local embedding and extraction, along with watermark localization via a flexiblemasking mechanism.• Extensive experiments demonstrate MaskMark excels in global and local extraction, as well asmulti-watermark embedding, while maintaining high visual quality of the watermarked images.• MaskMark is highly efficient, requiring 15× less compute than WAM, seamlessly scales to higherwatermark bit lengths (e.g., 64 or 128), and supports fast fine-tuning for quick adaptation to differentattack scenarios, enhancing its practicality.2Background2.1Image WatermarkingImage watermarking techniques can generally be categorized into two types: global watermarkingand local watermarking methods. Global watermarking methods aim to extract watermark2information from the entire image. Most traditional deep learning-based approaches fall intothis category. These methods focus on achieving robustness against various types of distortions,ensuring that the embedded watermark can still be reliably recovered even when the image undergoesdegradation. For example, MBRS (Jia et al., 2021) specifically targets robustness against JPEGcompression. Methods like StegaStamp (Tancik et al., 2020) and PIMoG (Fang & et al., 2022) aredesigned to handle real-world physical distortions such as screen-shooting and print-shooting. Morerecent approaches like ZoDiac (Zhang et al., 2024a) and SuperMark (Hu et al., 2024a) tackle adaptiveattacks, while Robust-Wide (Hu et al., 2024b) and VINE (Lu et al., 2024) focus on robustness againstinstruction-driven image editing.In contrast, local watermarking methods focus on extracting watermark information from aspecific region of the image. Recent methods, such as WAM (Sander et al., 2025) and our proposedMaskMark, belong to this category. WAM treats watermark extraction as a segmentation task (Kirillovet al., 2023), predicting watermark bits at the pixel level. This fine-grained approach enables preciselocal extraction but also introduces challenges. As the predicted bit length per pixel increases (e.g.,beyond 32 bits), the task becomes more difficult, causing training instability and reduced performance.Additionally, WAM’s training is computationally expensive, requiring eight V100 GPUs for nearlya week, making it impractical for widespread use. Moreover, WAM does not support native localwatermark embedding; instead, it globally embeds a watermark and then crops the image to focus onthe local region, introducing inherent losses during embedding that weaken the robustness of finalextraction.2.2Watermark LocalizationWatermark localization (Zhang et al., 2024b; Hu et al., 2025; Sander et al., 2025) refers to theability to determine which regions of a watermarked image still contain watermark information aftermodifications. This capability enables the identification of unaltered content, serving as an activedetection mechanism for tamper localization. Currently, image watermarking techniques primarilyadopt two paradigms for watermark localization. The first paradigm embeds a one-dimensionalcopyright watermark alongside a two-dimensional localization watermark in the original image.During extraction, localization is based on the fragility of the localization watermark, which cannotbe fully recovered from a modified image. Key methods in this category include EditGuard (Zhanget al., 2024b) and OmniGuard (Zhang et al., 2024c). EditGuard embeds a solid-color templatewithin the host image and attempts to recover it from a modified version. The difference betweenthe recovered and original templates is calculated at each pixel, and a threshold-based decisionidentifies watermark-preserved regions. OmniGuard improves upon EditGuard by embedding anatural image as the template, enhancing fidelity. It also introduces a Degradation-aware TamperExtractor, improving robustness in detecting tampered regions under distortion. This paradigmrequires parallel extraction of both copyright and localization watermarks, which may affect imagequality. Moreover, both watermarks need independent robustness, and the presence of the templatewatermark does not guarantee the presence of the copyright watermark.The second paradigm, in contrast, embeds only a one-dimensional copyright bitstream anddirectly determines the presence or absence of watermark information at each pixel to achievelocalization. Methods such as WAM (Sander et al., 2025) and our proposed MaskMark fall underthis category. WAM employs a decoder that simultaneously performs pixel-wise watermark presencedetection and copyright bit extraction. In contrast, our MaskMark incorporates a dedicated localizationmodule within the decoder, focusing solely on watermark presence detection at each pixel. Thisapproach is more lightweight and easier to optimize. Compared to the first paradigm, this methodensures that the localized watermark regions strictly correspond to the areas containing copyrightwatermark information, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, it guarantees both the robustness ofcopyright watermark extraction and the robustness of localization.3Methodology3.1Design PrinciplesIn general, our objective is to enable the watermark model to effectively extract watermarks fromimages where only local regions are watermarked. We identify three primary reasons why traditionalwatermark models fail in this scenario. First, the decoder is trained exclusively on globally water-3𝑓𝑓!1010EncoderDecoderValuemetricGeometric𝐼""#$%!𝐼&'Fuse𝑊()U-NetU2NetCNN𝐼'*$+JNDWatermark EmbeddingWatermark MaskingWatermark Extraction𝐼""#$%𝐼%,-Mask Generation𝑀()Distortion Pool1010𝐼./01𝑊12Full.Rec.Irr.Seg.Candidate MasksRandom𝑀Figure 1: The overall end-to-end training pipeline of MaskMark.

(2) In the Watermark Embedding stage, the encoder E embeds the watermarkbits Wgt into the original image Iorig, optionally using the mask M (for MaskMark-ED), to producethe watermarked image Iwm. (3) In the Watermark Masking stage, the mask M is used to fuseIorig and Iwm, resulting in the fused image Ifuse, which is then subjected to a randomly selecteddistortion from a predefined distortion pool, yielding the distorted image I′fuse. The masked regionis then cropped using M to obtain Imask. (4) In the Watermark Extraction stage, the decoder Dextracts the predicted watermark bits Wpd from Imask and the predicted mask Mpd from I′fuse.marked images and has never encountered cases where only a local region contains a watermark.Consequently, it is unable to perform zero-shot extraction when presented with such images. Second,the non-watermarked portions of an image interfere with the decoder’s extraction process, especiallywhen the watermark occupies a small area, leading to extraction failure. Third, because the decoderis optimized for global watermark extraction, the encoder tends to dilute the watermark’s intensityover the entire image. This results in local regions having either insufficient or fragmented watermarkstrength, thereby exacerbating the extraction challenge.To address these challenges, we find that simply incorporating a basic mask mechanism during thedecoding stage to manipulate the watermarked image generated by the encoder is sufficient. To solvethe first issue, we retain only the watermark in the regions selected by the mask while setting thepixel values of the remaining regions to zero, thereby training the decoder to extract watermarksfrom partially watermarked images. To overcome the second issue, we replace the non-maskedregions with the original clean image and incorporate a watermark localization module in the decoder.This module learns to differentiate between watermarked and non-watermarked regions, effectivelymitigating the interference from irrelevant image content. These two strategies directly address thefirst and second challenges and indirectly resolve the third challenge. By ensuring that the decoder canextract the watermark from local regions and accurately distinguish it from non-watermarked areas,the encoder is encouraged to distribute the watermark strength uniformly across all local regionsrather than diluting it over the entire image, thereby preserving both extractability and distinctiveness.The strategies above form the basis of our MaskMark-D. To further enhance the encoder’s abilityto address the third challenge directly, we propose MaskMark-ED, which also introduces the maskmechanism during the encoding stage. In MaskMark-ED, the mask is embedded into the image alongwith the watermark bits during training. This enables the encoder to learn to actively concentrate thewatermark within the selected regions based on the embedded mask, thereby further improving therobustness of local watermarking.3.2OverviewThe overall end-to-end training pipeline is shown in Figure 1.

All of our model-free algorithm implementations are self-contained, with every object necessary to set the hyperparameters, run the training loop, and evaluatethe policy included in a single file. As model-based methods typically run sequential dynamics andpolicy training phases, we implement a single-file dynamics training script, that saves trained modelcheckpoints. These can then be imported by any of the policy training scripts for the model-basedalgorithms.G.2ConsistentEven within the same library, algorithm implementations often differ in boilerplate code. We changethe minimum number of lines between implementations, to control for implementation differencesand help developers. Specifically, we first ensure the single file implementation of the base algorithmslike BC and SAC-N is clear and concise (Figure 5b) and then make minimal differences from theiralgorithmic ancestors (Figure 5c).Figure 13a shows the minimal differences between clean implementations of each algorithm andFigure 13b shows the line differences from CQL.

However, the proliferation of adversar-ial applications, such as watermark removal [13, 22] has spurredsignificant interest in developing robust techniques that ensure min-imal collateral damage to the underlying content, while effectivelydisrupting embedded watermarks. This need arises from the inad-equacy of existing embedding techniques, which lack robustnessand are vulnerable to such adversarial manipulations [4, 22]. Cur-rent watermark removal approaches often face a trade-off betweenthe effectiveness of removal and the fidelity of the restored im-age [4], making it challenging to achieve both goals simultaneously.These approaches typically rely on heuristic-based filtering [15] orhand-crafted features [14]. With the rise of deep learning methods,various data-driven methods treated the watermark removal asan image-to-image translation task [18, 22], although other meth-ods [8, 10] considered both watermark localization and removal inmulti-task learning.With the rise of deep learning techniques across domains [2, 3,6, 7], researchers have also adopted it for watermark removal [10,16], which have shown promise in recent years. However, theyare often designed for specific watermarking patterns, limitingtheir generalization to unseen watermarking schemes. Additionally,many of these methods prioritize watermark removal at the expenseof image fidelity, resulting in perceptual degradation.Figure 1: Overview of the proposed Saliency-Aware DiffusionReconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark removal.This work proposes a novel salience-aware diffusion reconstruc-tion (SADRE) framework that addresses this challenge by integrat-ing adaptive noise injection with diffusion-based reconstruction.Our method leverages latent space representation to encode thewatermark image and injects strategically designed noise to disruptthe watermark while preserving essential image features. To ensurea high-quality reconstruction of the original image, we employa reverse diffusion process that iteratively removes noise, whileWWW Companion ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaInzamamul Alam, Md Tanvir Islam, & Simon S. Woomaintaining the structural and perceptual fidelity of the image. Akey innovation of our approach lies in the adaptive noise injectionmechanism, which dynamically adjusts the noise level based on thestrength and characteristics of the watermark. By incorporating var-ious noise distributions, such as Laplace, Cauchy, and Poisson, weprovide a flexible and robust solution capable of handling variouswatermarking scenarios. Furthermore, the theoretical underpin-nings of our framework, grounded in Hölder continuity [11] andstability guarantees, ensure robust performance under non-lineardistortions introduced by watermark embedding.Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-posed SADRE across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) watermark removal, by preserving image quality.Thus, the proposed SADRE bridges the gap between theoreti-cal robustness and practical effectiveness, making it a compellingsolution for real-world applications.2Threat Model and Problem StatementTo design an effective attack balancing watermark removal andimage fidelity and usability, the following subsection defines thethreat model and our problem.2.1Threat ModelThe adversary is assumed to have access to the watermarked image𝑥𝑤, which contains an embedded watermark, potentially used forcopyright protection or traceability. The goal of the adversary is toeffectively remove or disrupt this watermark such that it becomesundetectable by automated systems or human observers, preservingthe visual fidelity of the original image 𝑥. The adversary operatesunder the following assumptions:• The adversary does not possess the clean image 𝑥, but canestimate the strength of the watermark, denoted by 𝜏(𝑥𝑤).• The adversary does not know the exact watermark embed-ding mechanism, but assumes that the watermark influencesspecific regions of the latent representation 𝑧.• The adversary aims to balance watermark removal (minimiz-ing detectability), while preserving the image quality.2.2Problem StatementGiven a watermarked image 𝑥𝑤, the objective is to disrupt thewatermark such that the reconstructed image ˆ𝑥is indistinguishablefrom the original clean image 𝑥to both perceptual metrics andautomated detection systems which is involved in three key tasks:• Mapping the watermarked image 𝑥𝑤to a latent represen-tation 𝑧using an embedding function 𝜙, which preservesthe essential features of the image while exposing regionsaffected by the watermark.• Injecting structured noise 𝜂into the latent representation𝑧to disrupt the embedded watermark. The noise injectionmust be targeted to regions influenced by the watermark, asidentified by a saliency mask 𝑀.• Reconstructing the clean image ˆ𝑥using a reverse diffusionprocess 𝐴( ˜𝑧), which refines the perturbed latent representa-tion ˜𝑧to produce a high-fidelity output.Table 1: Summary of Notations.NotationDescription𝑥𝑤Watermarked image𝑥Clean image (no watermark)𝑧Latent space representation𝜙Embedding function for latent mapping𝑀Mask for watermark regions𝜂Noise added to disrupt the watermark𝜎Adaptive noise level𝜏(𝑥𝑤)Watermark strength estimate˜𝑧Perturbed latent representation𝐴( ˜𝑧)Reverse diffusion for reconstruction𝛼𝑡Noise schedule for diffusion𝜖Gaussian noise in forward diffusion𝜖𝜃Predicted noise in reverse diffusion𝑊𝑝Wasserstein distance (distribution gap)DSSIMStructural dissimilarity index𝜆𝑤Weighting factorThe problem can be formally defined as below, where we aim tofind a noise injection mechanism 𝜂and a reconstruction process 𝐴such that the following conditions are satisfied:(1) Watermark Invisibility: The Wasserstein distance 𝑊𝑝between the distributions of clean and watermarked imagesis minimized.𝑊𝑝(P𝑥, P𝑥𝑤) ≤Δ,where Δ is the acceptable threshold of perceptual similarity.(2) Reconstruction Stability: The error between the recon-structed image ˆ𝑥and the original clean image 𝑥is bounded,as expressed by the reconstruction stability theorem:P[∥𝐴( ˜𝑧) −𝑥∥≤𝜖] ≥1 −𝛿,(3) Perceptual Fidelity: The reconstructed image ˆ𝑥satisfiesperceptual quality metrics, such as Peak Signal-to-NoiseRatio (PSNR) and Structural Dissimilarity Index (DSSIM),ensuring minimal distortion compared to 𝑥, where 𝜖dependson the noise level 𝜎and the properties of the diffusion model.To ensure clarity and consistency, all the notations used in thispaper are summarized in Table 1.3Proposed Method: SADREWe propose salience-aware diffusion reconstruction (SADRE) com-bines structured noise injection, region-specific perturbations, andadvanced reconstruction techniques to achieve effective watermarkremoval while preserving high image fidelity, offering significantimprovements over existing approaches.Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction for Effective Invisible Watermark RemovalWWW Companion ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, Australia3.1Latent Representation and Region-SpecificNoise InjectionThe watermark removal process for SADRE begins by mappingthe watermarked image 𝑥𝑤into a latent space representation 𝑧using the embedding function 𝜙. This mapping retains the essentialfeatures of the image, however exposing regions influenced bythe watermark. Then, the 𝜙satisfies a “localized Hölder continuity”condition [11] as expressed in Eq. 1.∥𝜙(𝑥𝑤) −𝜙(𝑥)∥𝑀≤𝐶∥𝑥𝑤−𝑥∥𝛼ℎ,(1)where 𝑀is a saliency mask identifying watermark-affected re-gions, 𝐶> 0 is a constant, and 0 < 𝛼ℎ≤1. This ensures stabilityin the mapping, particularly in watermark-affected regions, whileminimizing distortions in other areas of the image.After obtaining the latent representation 𝑧, noise 𝜂is injectedinto it to disrupt the embedded watermark. The perturbation latentrepresentation as expressed in Eq. 2, is localized to the regionsspecified by the saliency mask 𝑀, ensuring efficient watermarkdisruption without significantly altering unaffected regions. Then,the perturbed latent representation is expressed as follows:˜𝑧= 𝑧+ 𝑀⊙𝜂,(2)where ⊙represents element-wise multiplication and noise 𝜂isdrawn from carefully selected distributions tailored for specificproperties of the watermark. The Laplace distribution, defined as𝑝(𝜂) =12𝑏exp−|𝜂|𝑏, where 𝑏=𝜎√2, is used for sparse and lo-calized perturbations. For handling strong watermark signals, theCauchy distribution, characterized by its heavy tails, is employedand given as 𝑝(𝜂) =1𝜋𝛾(1+ 𝜂2𝛾2 ) , where 𝛾is the scale parameter. Tomaintain proportionality to the signal magnitude, the Poisson dis-tribution is utilized, defined as 𝑝(𝜂; 𝜆) = 𝜆𝜂𝑒−𝜆𝜂!, where 𝜆is a rateparameter. The noise level 𝜎is adaptively determined based onthe estimated strength of the watermark 𝜏(𝑥𝑤), ensuring a balancebetween effective watermark disruption and preserving fidelity as:𝜎(𝑥𝑤) = arg min𝜎E[Detectability + 𝜆𝑤· Distortion].(3)Hence, this adaptive strategy targets watermark-affected regionswhile minimizing unnecessary noise injection.3.2Reconstruction Using Diffusion ProcessOnce the latent representation is perturbed, the reconstructionprocess begins to recover the clean image ˆ𝑥. And, advanced latentdiffusion models are employed for this purpose, as they effectivelyhandle stochastic processes while ensuring high reconstructionquality. The reconstruction step involves two distinct phases. Dur-ing the forward diffusion phase, noise is gradually added to thelatent representation, simulating a stochastic trajectory from datato noise. This process is represented as 𝑧𝑡= √𝛼𝑡𝑧𝑡−1 + √1 −𝛼𝑡𝜖,where 𝛼𝑡is the noise schedule and 𝜖is Gaussian noise. The adaptivenoise 𝜂acts as a targeted perturbation to disrupt the watermarkbefore the diffusion model adds general noise 𝜖.In the reverse diffusion phase, the added noise is iteratively re-moved, reconstructing the data by following the learned probabilitydistribution. This phase is described as ˜𝑧𝑡−1 = 𝑧𝑡−√1−𝛼𝑡𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡)√𝛼𝑡,where 𝜖𝜃is the noise predicted by the diffusion model at eachtimestep 𝑡. The reconstruction is further refined by prioritizingregions identified by the saliency mask 𝑀, which focuses on pre-serving the image’s most critical features by mitigating distortionsintroduced during perturbation. Finally, the reconstructed cleanimage is expressed as ˆ𝑥= 𝐴( ˜𝑧), where 𝐴represents the reversediffusion process. This two-step reconstruction ensures a balancebetween high-quality restoration and watermark disruption.Theorem 1: Reconstruction Stability. For the noisy latent rep-resentation ˜𝑧, the reconstruction process 𝐴satisfies the stabilitycondition with a high probability of 1 −𝛿for noise levels 𝜎< 𝜎𝑐, acritical threshold as follows:P[∥𝐴( ˜𝑧) −𝑥∥≤𝜖] ≥1 −𝛿,(4)where 𝜖depends on 𝜎, 𝑀, and the stability of the diffusion model.3.3Verification and Theoretical GuaranteesThe proposed SADRE’s effectiveness is evaluated using theoreticalguarantees and empirical metrics, ensuring robustness in water-mark removal and high perceptual fidelity in the reconstructedimage. The invisibility of the watermark is measured by the Wasser-stein distance 𝑊𝑝between the distributions of clean and water-marked images:𝑊𝑝(P𝑥, P𝑥𝑤) ≤Δ,(5)where Δ quantifies the difference between the two distributions.This eq 5 ensures that the structural divergence between the cleanand watermarked images is minimized during the perturbation andreconstruction processes, making the watermark indistinguishablefrom the natural image distribution.The trade-off between Type I and Type II errors is described as:𝜖2 ≥Φ(Φ−1(1 −𝜖1) −Δ𝜎),(6)where 𝜖1 represents the Type I error (probability of detecting awatermark in a clean image) and 𝜖2 represents the Type II error(probability of failing to detect a watermark in a watermarkedimage). And, the noise level 𝜎plays a crucial role in balancing theseerrors. A larger 𝜎reduces Δ/𝜎, which decreases 𝜖2, making thewatermark removal more effective, but may slightly increase 𝜖1.This equation highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate𝜎to balance detectability and reconstruction fidelity.To further reliability, error bounds are derived from Theorem 1:∥𝐴( ˜𝑧) −𝑥∥≤𝐶Δ𝛼ℎ𝑀+ O(𝜎),(7)where Δ𝑀reflects the impact of the saliency mask 𝑀. Thisequation 7 emphasizes the trade-off between the divergence inwatermark-affected regions, represented by Δ𝛼ℎ𝑀, and the noise-induced error, represented by O(𝜎). The constant 𝐶is determinedby the embedding function 𝜙, and 𝛼ℎrepresents the Hölder con-tinuity parameter, ensuring that perturbations are localized andcontrolled.WWW Companion ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaInzamamul Alam, Md Tanvir Islam, & Simon S.

8,BrowseComp_ A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Browsing Agents.pdf,"Figure 5: Analyzing BrowseComp task diﬃculty with percentage distribution of model pass rates forOpenAI o1 and OpenAI Deep Research models.4.5Distribution of pass ratesAs further analysis, we examined the distribution of pass rates for Deep Research and OpenAI o1 overall 1,266 tasks in the BrowseComp benchmark, using 64 trials per question, to better understand taskdiﬃculty. As shown in the ﬁgure below, Deep Research perfectly solved 16% of the tasks (100% passrate) but failed entirely on 14% (0% pass rate), indicating a wide gap in task diﬃculty. Additionally,many tasks fall in-between the two extremes, suggesting varying levels of challenge and that the modelscan struggle depending on the task structure and domain.For the subset of questions where Deep Research never produced a correct answer, we conducted afollow-up by prompting the model with the ground-truth answer and asking it to retrieve supportingweb evidence. In most cases, the model succeeded, conﬁrming that these questions were not unsolvable,but simply extremely diﬃcult to crack without guidance. This suggests that many BrowseComp taskstest more than retrieval—they demand strategic perseverance, ﬂexible search reformulation, and theability to assemble fragmented clues across multiple sources.Indeed, BrowseComp originally included 1,287 tasks.Upon reviewing the 118 tasks where DeepResearch had a 0% pass rate, we identiﬁed 21 tasks where the labeled ground-truth answer was eithermismatched with the required answer format, ambiguous in phrasing, or incorrect based on reasoning.These tasks were removed from the dataset.5Related work and discussionThere has been a long-standing interest in using AI to retrieve information from the internet. Thetask of retrieving information from the internet were of interest in the natural language process-ing community as early as IBM Watson (Ferrucci et al., 2010), with interest increasing with thepopularization of pre-trained language models (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020). Compared toprior work that focuses on information that could be easily found by a human within ten minutesof searching (Joshi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Thorne et al., 2018; Dinan et al., 2019; Lee et al.,2019; Fan et al., 2019; Petroni et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2022; Mialon et al., 2023; Song et al., 2025),BrowseComp focuses on the ability to retrieve hard-to-ﬁnd, deeply entangled information on the web.8The target model class that BrowseComp could be used to evaluate are models that have access to theinternet. Early version of AI agents that can only make a limited number of tool calls and are not goodat backtracking would presumably struggle on this benchmark (Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al.,2022; Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023), but more recent versions of language models trained withreinforcement learning are more likely to achieve at least double-digit percentage performance onBrowseComp (Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2025b,a; perplexity.AI, 2025; x.AI, 2025). While BrowseComprequired that trainers provide textual evidence supporting their claims, future benchmarks couldevaluate the ability to ﬁnd information by interacting with diﬀerent modalities, such as images, video,audio, or interactive webpages.In closing, BrowseComp is an evaluation of how well models can persistently browse the internet tosearch for hard-to-ﬁnd information. While BrowseComp does not aim to measure performance oncommon queries, it measures the ability to ﬁnd a single targeted piece of information, is easy-to-evaluate, and is challenging for existing browsing agents. We hope that open-sourcing BrowseCompdrives research on more trustworthy and reliable AI agents, and we invite researchers to evaluate thecapabilities of more AI agents on it, and to provide us feedback.ReferencesE.

Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a ro-bust feature extractor during the base training session withabundant training samples and subsequently freeze this ex-tractor, only fine-tuning the classifier in subsequent incre-mental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus onpreventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the rela-tionship between novel and base classes, without paying at-tention to the specific decision spaces of each class. To ad-dress this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play AdaptiveDecision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatiblewith most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specificdecision boundary to each class and adaptively adjust theseboundaries during training to optimally refine the decisionspaces for the classes in each session. Furthermore, to am-plify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novelinter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision bound-aries and prototypes for each class. Extensive experimentson three benchmarks, namely CIFAR100, miniImageNet, andCUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS methodwith existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves per-formance, achieving overall state-of-the-art results.Code — https://github.com/Yongzhang-Tan/ADBSIntroductionTo date, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) haveachieved significant advancements in the field of computervision, primarily using models trained on static and pre-collected large-scale annotated datasets (Deng et al. 2009;He et al. 2016). However, the practical challenge of grad-ually integrating data from new classes into a model ini-tially trained on existing classes introduces significant obsta-cles, known as Class Incremental Learning (CIL) (Hou et al.2019; Li and Hoiem 2017; Rebuffi et al. 2017; Cheng et al.2025). Unlike standard classification tasks, CIL requireshandling new classes and restricted access to prior task data*Linhao Li and Yongzhang Tan are co-first authors.†Corresponding Author.Copyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of ArtificialIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Figure 1: Illustration of FSCIL classification with (a) Fixedand (b) Our proposed adaptive decision boundaries. A fixeddecision boundary strategy often struggles to reserve ade-quate space for new classes at each incremental stage, re-sulting in space conflicts between old and new classes. Incontrast, our proposed adaptive decision boundary strategycan effectively alleviate this issue by adjusting the decisionboundaries of both old and new classes.in incremental sessions. Consequently, simply updating themodel with new class data may lead to overfitting on thesenew classes and cause significant performance drops onpreviously learned classes, a phenomenon known as catas-trophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen 1989; Masanaet al. 2022). Nonetheless, CIL requires sufficient trainingdata from novel classes. In many applications, data col-lection and labeling can be prohibitively expensive, posingchallenges for implementing CIL in real-world scenarios.To address these challenges, Few-Shot Class-IncrementalLearning (FSCIL) is proposed to address the dual challengesof learning new classes from limited examples and integrat-ing this knowledge into an existing model without forgettingpreviously acquired information (Tao et al. 2020). Critically,the model must maintain a balance between stability andplasticity, preserving previously acquired knowledge whileseamlessly integrating new information.Recent advancements in FSCIL methods (Zhang et al.arXiv:2504.10976v1 [cs.CV] 15 Apr 20252021; Cheraghian et al. 2021; Dong et al. 2021; Zhao et al.2021; Zhou et al. 2022a; Chen, Wang, and Hu 2022; Yanget al. 2023; Fan et al. 2024) have shown remarkable perfor-mance in image classification tasks. These methods typicallyemploy a learning pipeline that includes pre-training themodel during a data-rich base session, followed by merelyconstructing a classifier for novel classes on the frozen back-bone during incremental sessions. While this approach ef-fectively integrates new classes while retaining previouslylearned information, it still remains a significant challenge,i.e., conflicts in the decision space between old and novelclasses, as depicted in Figure 1(a). When the features ofbase classes are similar to those of novel classes, classify-ing novel classes may disrupt the classification of the pre-established base classes. Moreover, in scenarios with a fixedbackbone, base classes typically do not reserve space for un-known novel classes, leading to performance degradation.Several approaches (Song et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2022a)have attempted to address this issue by introducing virtualclasses to reserve feature space for novel classes. However,it remains challenging to predict the feature space of novelclasses that significantly deviate from base classes usingonly data augmentation-based strategies, e.g., mixup. Addi-tionally, finding a balance between the space reserved forbase and novel classes to avoid compromising base clas-sification tasks remains a significant issue. Previous stud-ies (Peng et al. 2022; Zou et al. 2022; Guo et al. 2023) haveattempted to introduce decision boundaries in FSCIL to im-prove inter-class cohesion. However, these methods, whichrely on predetermined hyperparameters to set boundaries,often fail to accurately define precise demarcations. Theaforementioned observations prompt us to construct adap-tive decision boundaries to accurately predict base classesand reserve more space for incoming novel classes.In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive DecisionBoundary Strategy (ADBS) for FSCIL, which assigns a spe-cific decision boundary to each class that dynamically ad-justs based on the training data. To enhance the distinctive-ness between classes, we also implement a novel inter-classconstraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries andprototypes for each class. The proposed ADBS significantlyimproves class separation and effectively reduces conflictsin the feature space between existing and incoming classes,as shown in Figure 1(b). Furthermore, ADBS is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with existing FS-CIL frameworks without necessitating modifications to thenetwork architecture.To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:• We introduce a plug-and-play Adaptive Decision Bound-ary Strategy (ADBS) designed to mitigate conflicts be-tween base and novel classes in the feature space withinFSCIL tasks. Our theoretical analysis verifies that thisstrategy effectively differentiates class centers and opti-mizes their boundaries.• We employ an inter-class constraint to optimize the de-cision boundaries and prototypes for each class, furtherenhancing the distinguishability between classes.• We evaluate the ABDS method over three FSCIL bench-marks: CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200. Exper-imental results and visualizations demonstrate that in-corporating ADBS with existing FSCIL algorithms, in-cluding both the baseline and state-of-the-art methods,consistently enhances performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance.Related WorkFew-Shot Class-Incremental LearningThe concept of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FS-CIL) was first introduced in TOPIC (Tao et al. 2020), whichaims to address the dual challenges of catastrophic forget-ting and learning new classes incrementally from a limitednumber of labeled samples. TOPIC tackled these issues byimplementing a neural gas (NG) network. Current meth-ods in FSCIL can be categorized into two main groups:one updates the backbone network during incremental ses-sions (Cheraghian et al. 2021; Dong et al. 2021; Kang et al.2023; Li et al. 2024), while the others maintain a fixed back-bone. The latter group attempts to suppress forgetting oldknowledge while adapting smoothly to novel classes usingvarious approaches. Several methods improve model perfor-mance by constructing diverse powerful classifiers, such asETF (Yang et al. 2023) or stochastic classifiers (Kalla andBiswas 2022). Other methods (Zhou et al. 2022a; Song et al.2023) introduce virtual classes to pre-allocate feature spacefor novel classes, while additional methods include episodictraining (Zhou et al. 2022b; Zhu et al. 2021) or ensemblelearning (Ji et al. 2023) to boost the capabilities of backbone.Recent methods (Yang, Liu, and Xu 2021; Liu et al. 2023)consider to employ distribution calibration to adjust the clas-sifier. OrCo (Ahmed, Kukleva, and Schiele 2024) promotesclass separation by leveraging feature orthogonality in therepresentation space and contrastive learning.Boundary-based MethodBoundary-based methods, which focus on learning opti-mal decision boundaries, are extensively employed in var-ious vision tasks such as image classification (Chen et al.2020; Wang et al. 2024), semantic segmentation (Liu et al.2022), and domain generalization (Dayal et al. 2024). Thewidespread use and success of these methods in diverse ap-plications highlight their efficacy, showcasing their capabil-ity to manage complex visual data with exceptional accuracyand reliability.Several methods also explore boundary strategies withinthe FSCIL domain. In prior studies, ALICE (Peng et al.2022) utilizes angular penalty loss with hyperparameter-defined boundaries to enhance inter-class cohesion, yetthese boundaries are not effectively utilized during in-ference. Conversely, CLOM (Zou et al. 2022) employshyperparameter-based methods to establish positive andnegative boundaries by considering distances between classprototypes, while DBONet (Guo et al. 2023) assumes thatdata feature vectors follow a spherical Gaussian distributionand employs within-class variance to define boundaries. Al-though these approaches promote class separation to somedegree, they often struggle to achieve precise boundary ac-curacy. Additionally, traditional boundary-based methodsfrequently require modifications to the model architecture,which restricts their widespread application. To overcomethese limitations, we introduce a plug-and-play AdaptiveDecision Boundary Strategy that captures more accurateboundaries and effectively resolves conflicts between newand old classes in the feature space.PreliminaryProblem StatementIn FSCIL, we conduct a series of continuous learning ses-sions, each featuring a steady stream of training data rep-resented as Dtrain = {Dttrain}Tt=0. Each subset Dttrain={(xi, yi)}Nti=0 contains training samples from session t, withxi and yi denote the i-th image and its corresponding la-bel, respectively. The initial session, termed the base session,provides a substantial amount of training data. Each subse-quent session, referred to as an incremental session, adoptsan N-way, K-shot setting, which includes N classes, eachwith K samples. The label space for the t-th session is de-noted by Ct, which is disjoint between different sessions,i.e., Ct1 ∩Ct2 = ∅when t1 ̸= t2. The model trained onDttrain should be evaluated on Dttest, which includes all classesencountered up to the t-th session, represented as Sti=0 Ci.Base Pretraining and Novel Fine-tuning StrategyThe Base Classes Pretraining and Novel Classes Fine-tuning(BPNF) strategy (Tian et al. 2024) is a common approachin the FSCIL scenario, which involves initial pre-trainingon abundant base data, followed by fine-tuning to enhanceadaptation to novel classes during the incremental phase.In general, an FSCIL model is decomposed into two com-ponents: a feature extractor f(·) and a dynamic classifierwith weights W. The output of the model is represented as:ϕ(x) = W ⊤f(x),(1)where ϕ(x) ∈R|C|×1, W ∈Rd×|C|, and f(x) ∈Rd×1 withd and C denotes the output feature dimension and number ofclasses, respectively.Specifically, BPNF first leverages sufficient data in thebase session to train the model by optimizing the loss foreach sample x:Lcls(ϕ; x, y) = l(ϕ(x), y),(2)where l(·, ·) denotes the cross-entropy loss function.After the base training phase, f(·) is fixed, and the clas-sifier is expanded in each subsequent incremental session:W =Sti=0{wi1, wi2, · · · , wi|Ci|}, where each term is parame-terized by the prototype of the corresponding novel class:wtc = 1KKXi=1f(xi).(3)In t-th session, inference is performed using the NearestClass Mean (NCM) (Mensink et al. 2013) algorithm to eval-uate the accuracy of all encountered classes by predictingthe class ˆctx with:ˆctx = argmaxc,tsim (f(x), wtc),(4)where sim(x, y) =x⊤y∥x∥∥y∥represents the cosine similaritybetween two vectors.MethodologyIn this section, we provide a detailed description of ourproposed methodologies, Adaptive Decision Boundary andInter-class Constraint. The overview of the entire trainingpipeline is illustrated in Figure 2.Adaptive Decision BoundaryTo more effectively partition the feature space, we proposethe Adaptive Decision Boundary (ADB). This approach in-volves assigning a unique decision boundary to each classand continuously adapting it throughout the training process.This strategy conserves the feature space utilized by the baseclasses, thus liberating additional feature space for the com-ing new classes.Previous research typically assigns a unified decisionboundary to all classes instead of implementing individualboundaries for each class. This common practice usually re-sults in a decision boundary that is determined by the classwith the most dispersed inter-class features, which can leadto an excessively large boundary for all classes, as illustratedin Figure 2 (a). This practice can clutter the feature space fornew classes, resulting in conflicts when new classes are in-troduced. Drawing inspiration from (Zou et al. 2022), weestablish a specific boundary for each class and further pro-pose adaptive adjustments to these boundaries.In the base session, we initially assign a decisionboundary to each base class, formally defined as: M ={m01, m02, . . . , m0|C0|}, M ∈R1×|C0|. We then incorporatethese adaptive boundaries into the model as follows:ϕ(x) = (W · M)⊤f(x).(5)Throughout the training process, we apply Eq. 2 to refineboth the original model and the boundaries M, thereby fa-cilitating the adaptive adjustment of M towards the optimaldecision boundary.Compared to the less precise boundaries determined byhyperparameters in CLOM (Zou et al. 2022), our methodadaptively adjusts the decision boundaries during training.Assuming that clear distinctions already exist between baseclasses without the use of boundaries M, our method al-lows the boundaries of classes with smaller feature spacesto adaptively and substantially contract, guided by the lossfunction described in Eq. 2. Concurrently, the boundaries ofother classes will also contract to a degree, as illustrated inFigure 2 (b). This strategy liberates additional space for newclasses, effectively reducing the conflicts between existingand incoming classes within the feature space.In incremental sessions, previous methods typically em-ploy only Eq. 3 to compute prototypes without adjustingboundaries. As a result of continuing to use the static bound-aries of the old classes, the new classes fail to adapt to theirFigure 2: The overall pipeline of our Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS).

However, the non-Euclidean natureand the scarcity of labeled data pose significant challenges in graphanalysis. Recently, graph self-supervised learning (SSL) has beenproposed to address these issues by uncovering meaningful patternsfrom massive unlabeled data through pretext tasks. Graph SSL hasbeen demonstrated to be useful in a wide range of downstreamapplications, such as social recommendation [42] and molecularproperty prediction [17].Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been a dominantapproach for self-supervised learning on graphs. Existing studieson GCL mainly rely on perturbing the original graph informationto generate new views. However, it has been pointed out in [51]that inappropriate perturbations could disrupt the graph’s inherentstructure, leading to information loss or noise corruption. In otherwords, poorly-designed view generation strategies could degrademodel performance, resulting in learned embeddings that lack se-mantic consistency. Therefore, the design of suitable perturbationtechniques is crucial for these models, adding difficulty to theirdevelopment.Another prominent approach for implementing SSL on graphs isgraph autoencoding. One popular and effective variant is maskedgraph autoencoding, which utilizes masked node features [15] orgraph topology [22] to learn robust node representations. How-ever, similar to contrastive learning, these masking methods canalso introduce inappropriate perturbations, risking the loss of thegraph’s inherent information. Beyond perturbation-based methods,Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) [38] haveemerged as an alternative approach, which encodes input featuresinto discrete latent embeddings by mapping them into a quantizedarXiv:2504.12715v1 [cs.LG] 17 Apr 2025WWW ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaLong Zeng, Jianxiang Yu, Jiapeng Zhu, Qingsong Zhong, and Xiang Licodebook and decodes by retrieving corresponding codebook en-tries to reconstruct the raw input features. It offers significant datacompression capabilities that enable the model to be easily appliedto large-scale data. Despite the success, its application to graphdata remains underexplored. Existing works either focus on limiteddownstream tasks like molecular graph classification [6, 43], orrely on supervised training [45], falling far short in fully leveragingVQ-VAE for graph SSL.In this paper, to bridge the gap, we extend VQ-VAE to graph SSL.We first empirically analyze VQ-VAE when applied to graph data,showing how well vector quantization can enhance the model’scapability in capturing the underlying graph topology. Then weidentify two key challenges when applying VQ-VAE to graph:The first issue is codebook space underutilization arising from the“winner-take-all” principle in competitive learning [1, 9], wheremany discrete codes within the codebook remain unused duringthe training process. This insufficiency limits the model’s capacityto represent diverse feature patterns in the graph. While Gumbel-Softmax [18] has been explored as a potential solution to improvecodebook utilization by enabling more flexible sampling, our ex-periments on graph data indicate that it produces less satisfactoryresults, possibly due to the randomness introduced by reparame-terization, which increases the instability of gradient updates. Toaddress this limitation, we propose an annealing-based encodingstrategy, which dynamically selects code embeddings in the code-book. Specifically, in the early stage, the model is encouraged toexplore a wide range of available code vectors, which forces themodel to utilize more codes. With training epochs, the probabilityof selecting useless codes decreases and the model will concentratemore on the effective ones.The second challenge is codebook space sparsity, which refersto the fact that in traditional VQ-VAE, individual code vectors aretreated as independent entities with no regard for the inherentrelationships between nodes in the graph. This may lead to the pro-jection of similar nodes into different code vectors. To overcome theissue, we introduce a second layer on top of the first one, developinga two-layer codebook with a hierarchical structure that reflects therelationships between codes. The second layer can connect codeswith similar embeddings, which can be used to further promoteclose embedding learned for similar nodes in the graph. Finally, ourmain contributions in this paper are summarized as follows.• We propose a novel graph SSL method HQA-GAE, which is aHierarchical vector Quantized and Annealing code selectionbased Graph Auto-encoder.• We qualitatively analyze the effectiveness of vector quanti-zation in utilizing graph topology and experimentally verifyour claim.• We present two key challenges in applying VQ-VAE to graphSSL: codebook space underutilization and codebook spacesparsity. We further put forward an annealing-based codeselection strategy and a hierarchical codebook mechanismto solve the issues, respectively.• We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the su-perior performance of HQA-GAE over 16 other state-of-the-art methods on both node classification and link predictiontasks.2Related WorkThis section reviews recent advances on graph SSL, with a fo-cus on two primary approaches: graph contrastive learning andautoencoding techniques. Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) hasemerged as a promising approach for SSL on graph-structureddata. It aims to learn robust node or graph-level representations bymaximizing the agreement between different augmented views ofthe same node/graph, while minimizing that with views of othernodes/graphs. Although early works [25, 35, 41, 46, 47, 50] havedemonstrated their efficacy, a key limitation of GCL lies in thereliance on manually designed augmentations that are often task-specific and may disrupt the structural integrity of graphs, lead-ing to suboptimal performance in certain domains [47]. Further,poorly designed augmentation schemes can inadvertently intro-duce noise, diminishing the semantic consistency of the learnedembeddings [51].Graph auto-encoding is another technique for graph SSL, whichlearns node embeddings by reconstructing the given input graph.In addition to graph auto-encoders [20, 27] and variational graphauto-encoders [12, 20, 23, 27], some advanced models have recentlybeen proposed. For example, Masked Graph Autoencoders (MGAE),such as GraphMAE [15] and MaskGAE [22], have drawn significantattention. These methods [14, 36, 49] introduce masking strategiesfor graph features or edges, followed by reconstruction, and haveshown promising results. Despite the success, the effectiveness ofmasked autoencoding heavily relies on the choice of masking strate-gies. Inappropriate masking can lead to significant information loss,which degrades the model performance.Further, Vector Quantized Variatinal Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) havedemonstrated notable success in the fields of computer vision[7, 30, 38] and computer audition [5, 48] by discretizing latentspaces, enhancing robustness and efficiency. They also hold po-tential for self-supervised learning on graphs; however, existingapplications remain limited and often fail to fully leverage the VQ-VAE framework. The early attempt VQ-GNN [6] explores the useof vector quantization as a dimensionality reduction tool in GNNs,which deviates significantly from the original VQ-VAE trainingscheme. Mole-BERT [43] and DGAE [4] apply VQ-VAE for molec-ular graph classification but restrict its scope to specific domains,lacking generalizability to broader graph tasks like node classi-fication and link prediction. VQ-Graph [45], on the other hand,adopts the VQ-VAE training approach but introduces labeled datarather than pursuing SSL. Moreover, key challenges, such as code-book underutilization and space sparsity, have not been adequatelyaddressed in previous works, which hinder model performance.Instead, our work aims to directly tackle these issues by exploringthe capabilities of VQ-VAE in graph data, thereby enhancing theeffectiveness of graph representation learning.3Preliminaries3.1Graph Self-supervised LearningA graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of nodes V and edges E,where |V| = 𝑁and each node 𝑣𝑖∈V can be associated with a fea-ture vector x𝑖∈R𝐷. The adjacency matrix A ∈R𝑁×𝑁encodes theconnectivity of the graph, where A𝑖𝑗= 1 if an edge exists betweennodes 𝑣𝑖and 𝑣𝑗, and 0 otherwise.

By leveraging pretext tasks, such as node featurereconstruction or contrastive learning, the model is encouraged tolearn semantic embeddings h𝑖∈R𝑑for each node, which capturekey graph properties.3.2Graph Neural NetworkGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learningfrom graph-structured data. A widely used GNN framework is theMessage Passing Neural Network (MPNN) [3, 19], which iterativelyupdates node representations based on messages passed from neigh-boring nodes. In the 𝑘-th message-passing iteration, a node 𝑣𝑖’srepresentation h(𝑘)𝑖is updated by aggregating the features of itsneighbors N (𝑖), starting from an initial representation h(0)𝑖= x𝑖.This process can be described by:h(𝑘)𝑖= 𝜎©­«h(𝑘−1)𝑖,Ê𝑗∈N(𝑖)𝜙(𝑘) h(𝑘−1)𝑖, h(𝑘−1)𝑗ª®¬,(1)where É is a permutation-invariant aggregation function (e.g.,mean, sum, or max), 𝜙denote differentiable functions like linearprojections, and 𝜎is a non-linear function. The output after 𝐾layers of message passing, h(𝐾)𝑖, serves as the final representationfor node 𝑣𝑖.3.3VQ-VAEVQ-VAE offers a perturbation-free autoencoder for learning dis-crete representations, which encodes input features into discretelatent embeddings by mapping them into a quantized codebookand decodes by retrieving corresponding codebook entries to re-construct the raw input features.

Un-fortunately, the curse of dimensionality makes it hard to process volumetricdata, which often encompasses substantial redundancy and necessitates aggres-sive down-sampling for practical applications [6]. In contrast, 3D shapes, includ-ing meshes and point clouds, offer more compact and intuitive alternatives for*Guoqing Zhang and Jingyun Yang contributed equally to this work.arXiv:2504.13015v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 20252G. Zhang et al.capturing, visualizing, and analyzing complex anatomical structures. The ac-curate understanding of 3D anatomical shapes holds great potential in variousmedical applications, such as disease diagnosis and surgical planning, underscor-ing their growing importance in modern medical imaging.Recently, the emergence of large-scale shape benchmarks [1,21] has substan-tially accelerated the evolution of 3D vision. Qi et al. propose PointNet [14],which firstly introduces shared multilayer perceptron (MLP) and max poolingfor global feature learning of point clouds. Subsequent works [15, 18] furtherimprove performance by exploiting local context information. However, MLPand convolution have limited capabilities to capture long-range dependencies.Inspired by the immense success of transformer in natural language processing(NLP) [2,17] and compute vision [3,12], sequential modeling of point clouds hasemerged as a dominant trend. Although transformer-based models [5, 24] haveachieved remarkable progress in point cloud learning, the quadratic complexityof self-attention mechanisms restricts their scalability. On the other hand, oneof the pioneers of state space models (SSM) named Mamba [4] has emerged as apopular network backbone in NLP and 2D vision tasks [11,16,19,25] with linearcomplexity and powerful sequence representation ability. A few very recent stud-ies [9, 10, 23] introduce grid and octree-based serialization to adapt Mamba forhandling point clouds, achieving comparable performance to transformer-basedcounterparts while significantly reducing computational overhead.Although there has been significant progress in general point cloud learning,few prior works systematically study medical point clouds due to the follow-ing challenges. First, the majority of medical data exists in the form of 2D or3D images, resulting in a scarcity of large-scale medical point cloud datasets.The launch of MedShapeNet [8], a large-scale medical shape dataset, provides apromising foundation for addressing this problem. Second, medical point cloudsinherently possess complex and nested structures, posing significant difficultiesfor the direct deployments of current methods.In this work, we present a comprehensive study into medical point cloud un-derstanding with the following contributions: (1) We propose an SSM-based hier-archical learning framework, combining coordinate-order and inside-out scanningstrategies, for joint local and global point feature learning at multiple scales; (2)We compile a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS fromprevious works, enabling robust evaluation of anatomical shape classification,completion, and segmentation tasks; (3) Extensive experiments on MedPointSdemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, suggesting the great potential ofSSMs and point cloud modeling in analyzing complex medical data. We hopethat our work will establish new benchmarks and provide a valuable resource toinspire and facilitate future research.2MethodsAn overview of our work is presented in Fig. 1.

The right part details how the point set isprocessed at each building block.position embedding p0 and feature projection f0, and ends with a max poolinglayer to generate the latent vector embedding z for different downstream tasks.During this, we recursively down-sample the point cloud and group multi-scalegeometric information from neighbors as depicted in Sec. 2.1. Sec. 2.2 elaborateshow point-wise features are extracted through an SSM-based learning block in alocal-to-global manner. In Sec. 2.3, we briefly introduce the employed decodersand their associated cost functions for medical point cloud classification, com-pletion, and segmentation tasks.2.1Hierarchical ArchitectureOur encoder follows a similar hierarchical design in PointNet++ [15], which iscomposed of M subsample levels. The i-th level processes a input set Pi−1 withNi−1 points, whose components are the coordinates xi−1 ∈RNi−1×d, positionembeddings pi−1 ∈RNi−1×Cp, and point features fi−1 ∈RNi−1×Ci−1. To ensurea compact and well-distributed representation of Pi−1, we apply farthest pointsampling (FPS) to select a subset Pi comprising Ni points, where xi ⊂xi−1, pi ⊂pi−1, and fi remains to be estimated. For each point in Pi, we perform k-nearestneighbor (KNN) search L times to group its neighbors in Pi−1 at multiple scales.The point set of neighbors at the j-th scale is denoted as Pjs, whose featuresf js ∈RNi×kj×(Ci−1+Cp) are the concatenation of grouped pi−1 and fi−1, with kjdenoting the number of neighbors. In our implementation, we set the number ofscales L as 2, with k1 = 16 and k2 = 32. An SSM-based learning block is utilizedto further extract point feature fi. It should be emphasized that while FPS isexecuted in metric space, KNN queries are performed in feature space to capture4G. Zhang et al.Fig. 2. Illustration of different scanning strategies and PSSM blocks.dynamic local structures. By iteratively performing the aforementioned steps, weprogressively compress the point cloud into NM representative key points withhigh-dimensional features.2.2SSM-based Point Feature LearningPreliminaries on SSM and Mamba. The traditional discrete-time SSM isa linear time-invariant system to map a 1-d sequence x to y through a hiddenstate h. Mathematically, it can be formulated with fixed parameters A, B, C,and a sampling step ∆as:ht = ¯Aht−1 + ¯Bxt, yt = Cht,(1)where ¯A and ¯B are zero-order hold (ZOH) discretization of A and B:¯A = exp (A∆), ¯B = (A∆)−1(exp (A∆) −I) · ∆B.(2)Mamba [4] introduces a selective scanning mechanism to derive B, C, and ∆from input sequence x, enabling effective modeling of long varying sequences.Point Cloud Serialization. Serialization is necessary to model irregular pointset with Mamba. The most intuitive strategy is to sort the points by coordinates,which is reasonable due to the fact that medical images are typically acquiredthrough slice-by-slice scanning. A z-order scanning can be described as:Θz = arg sort(P[’z’]),(3)where P[’z’] returns the z-coordinates of point set P, Θz is the sorted indices.Similarly, we have x-order scanning Θx and y-order scanning Θy. Consideringthat medical point clouds often contain multiple nested structures, we introducea simple inside-out scanning strategy that can be formulated as:Θio = arg sort(dist(P, mean(P))).(4)Here, dist(P, q) = {∥p −q∥| p ∈P}, mean(P) is the mean coordinate of P. Asillustrated in Fig. 2 (a), inside-out scanning is preferable for capturing nestedTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length5structures. Note that all scanning operations are performed in metric space. Thetransposed indices and inverted indices are denoted as Θ⊤and Θ−1, respectively.And we have:Θ−1 = arg sort(Θ), P[Θ][Θ−1] = P.(5)Vanilla and Group Point SSM Blocks. We implement Point SSM block(PSSM) as shown in Fig. 2 (b) for processing point set with Mamba, whichconsists of a selective scanning module, normalizations, residual connections,and linear projections. A serialized feature sequence can be directly processedthrough a vanilla PSSM block. In practice, combining multiple scanning strate-gies often leads to more robust point cloud modeling. Directly concatenatingdifferent scans into a longer sequence [9,23] or employing multiple PSSM blocksleads to increased computational complexity. However, a naive concatenationalong the channel dimension is also not recommended, because using the origi-nal parameter set to model a more complicated sequence may potentially obscurethe distinct features. We therefore utilize a hardware-aware group PSSM block,which takes a set of scan indices as additional inputs and derives a group of pa-rameters to process multiple scans concurrently as illustrated in Fig. 2 (c). Theresultant sequences are restored to point sets in original order using invertedindices merged through a simple summation.Local-to-Global Feature Extraction. As illustrated in the lower-right partof Fig. 1, given a batch of point set Pi and its neighbors Pjs at the j-th scale,we reshape f js ∈RB×Ni×kk×Cji to B × Ni short sequences of length of kj. Sincethe KNN query returns sorted results, which can be interpreted as a distance-based point serialization, these sequences are directly processed by a vanillapoint SSM block. Subsequently, we aggregate neighbors through a max poolingoperation to compute the j-th scale feature f jl ∈RB×Ni×Cji . The local featuresfl ∈RB×Ni×Ci are obtained by a simple concatenation across all scales: fl =concat(f 1l , ..., f Ll ), with Ci = PLj Cji . To better capture long-range dependencies,we perform coordinate-order, inside-out, and their transposed scanning on Pi togenerate a set of long sequence indices, which are further processed with localfeature fl through a group PSSM block to calculate global point feature fi.2.3Task-Specific DecodersLatent embedding z can be decoded to facilitate various downstream tasks aslisted in the follows: (1) For anatomy classification, we use a simple MLP tocompute the output class scores. The classification error is optimized throughthe cross-entropy loss. (2) For multi-class anatomy completion, we progressivelystretch a 2D grid into the target point cloud following the approach introduced inFoldingNet [22]. Latent embedding z of the partial point cloud is used as a shapesignature to guide the grid deformation. The model is trained by minimizinga density-aware Chamfer distance [20] between prediction and target. (3) Foranatomy segmentation task, point features are propagated through a hierarchicalinterpolation strategy. Given point set Pi = (xi, fi) from the i-th encoding level,6G. Zhang et al.Fig. 3. Visualization of completion (top) and segmentation (bottom) results.the corresponding counterpart ˆPi = (xi, ˆfi) in the decoding stage is updatedthrough the following equation:ˆfi = mlp(concat(fi, z)),if i = M;mlp(concat(fi, F(Pi, ˆPi+1))), otherwise.(6)In the above, F(Px, Py) calculates the distance-weighted interpolation of pointfeatures for each point in Px based on its k nearest neighbors in Py. We use acombination of cross-entropy and Dice loss as the segmentation cost function.3Experiments3.1MedPointS Dataset and Evaluation MetricsMedShapeNet [8] is a large-scale medical shape dataset that contains over 100,000meshes of various anatomical structures, from which we construct MedPointS,a large-scale dataset for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we se-lect patients from MedShapeNet with relatively complete body part scans andcompile a classification dataset comprising 28,737 anatomical structures across46 categories, with each sample containing no more than 16,384 points. For thecompletion task, an anchor point is randomly selected from each point cloud,and 20% of the nearest points are removed to generate its incomplete coun-terpart. Furthermore, we integrate these anatomical structures based on theircorresponding patients to create an anatomy segmentation dataset containing1,020 samples, each of which has 65,536 points.For all tasks, we randomly split the datasets into 5 folds, where the first 3folds are used for training, and the 4th fold is used for validation. Evaluationsare performed on the 5th fold. Anatomy classification is evaluated by accuracy(ACC). For multi-class anatomy completion, we report the Chamfer distance(CD) and earth mover’s distance (EMD). Anatomy segmentation is evaluatedby Dice score (Dice) and mean intersection over union (mIoU). In addition, wecompute soft Dice score (sDice) [13] to assess the uncertainty of the predictedprobability maps.Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length73.2Experimental SetupWe compare our method with previous state-of-the-art point cloud learning mod-els, including PointNet [14], PointNet++ [15], DGCNN [18], Point Cloud Trans-former (PCT) [5] and vanilla PointMamba [9]. To ensure a fair comparison, weemploy leaky ReLU activation and group normalization for all models. Eachmodel contains 5 building blocks with feature channels of [64, 64, 128, 256, 512]and one dense layer with an output channel Cz = 1024. Point clouds are ran-domly sampled to a size of 2,048, 2,048, and 4,096 for classification, completion,and segmentation tasks, respectively. Classification models are trained usingAdam [7] optimizer for 100 epochs, while completion and segmentation modelsare trained for 200 epochs. All models are trained on an NVIDIA A800 GPU.The learning rate starts from 1e−4 and follows a linear decaying schedule.Table 1.

Tab. 1 shows the quantitative re-sults for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Our network con-sistently outperforms previous methods on all tasks, demonstrating its robustcapability for medical point cloud understanding.We also observe that Point-Net++, an enhanced variant of PointNet, exhibits significantly inferior perfor-mance compared to its predecessor. This discrepancy may be attributed to theunique structural characteristics and high diversity inherent in medical pointcloud data. This indicates that the incorporation of local structures for medicalpoint cloud learning should be carefully designed. While DGCNN demonstrateshigh accuracy in both classification and segmentation tasks, it is important tonote that MLP and convolution-based models yield low soft Dice scores, sug-gesting a great degree of uncertainty in their outputs.

In natural image analysis, prevailing CL meth-ods like SimCLR (Chen et al. 2020a) and MoCo (He et al.2020) primarily focus on global discrimination. Explicitly,they consider the entire image and its transformations aspositive pairs, while treating different images as negativepairs (Wu et al. 2018; Misra and Maaten 2020).

In contrast, radiographic images present clinicalsalience dispersed throughout the image (Li et al. 2024), ne-cessitating the model’s attention to fine-grained discrimina-tion, including the distribution of densities, the arrangementof tissues, and the presence of specific pathologies (Aguet al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2021b). For example, faint opacitiesmay indicate early signs of pneumonia, while fine reticularpatterns can suggest interstitial lung disease. Therefore, in-corporating fine-grained details, such as detailed anatomicalstructures and complex spatial relationships (Haghighi et al.2024; Chen et al. 2023), into high-level representations isessential for accurately identifying normal anatomy and de-tecting various lesions in radiographic images.Recent advances in medical contrastive learning (MCL)have incorporated fine-grained information by focusing onregion discrimination (Chen et al. 2023; Singh, Gorade, andMishra 2024; Li et al. 2024). These approaches aim to em-bed semantically consistent features while distinguishingthem from features with distinct semantics (Taher, Gotway,arXiv:2504.10972v1 [cs.CV] 15 Apr 2025and Liang 2024). However, the variability of diseases makesit difficult to comprehensively capture pathological seman-tics, and additional resources are required to determine therelevant areas (such as pre-selection (Huang et al. 2021)).Another effective method for enriching fine-grained infor-mation is to integrate the pixel restoration with MCL (Zhouet al. 2021a; Haghighi et al. 2024). However, these meth-ods typically exhibit a deficiency in anatomical semantics,as they restore pixel-level content directly from latent rep-resentations. This plain pixel information limits the model’scapability to focus on salient clinical patterns.In this paper, to circumvent the challenge posed by hetero-geneous anomalies, which potentially leads to insufficientlearning of semantic information, we highlight that compre-hensive learning of normal anatomical patterns is compar-atively easier. This advantage stems from the significant se-mantic similarity observed in normal radiographic images(Xiang et al. 2023), which are characterized by anatomicalconsistency and stable focal regions across different indi-viduals (Fig. 1(a)). Such similarity facilitates the effectivedecoupling of underlying anomalies from normal structures,thereby enhancing pathological diagnosis performance. Ad-ditionally, to avoid region pre-selection, we hypothesize thateach distinct token in Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovit-skiy et al. 2021) explicitly represents the predominant in-formation of specific local anatomical structures. This hy-pothesis is inspired by SelfPatch (Yun et al. 2022), whichasserts that ViTs have inherent architectural advantages forenhancing visual representations through the processing ofdiscrete image tokens. Summarily, our core idea is to alignanatomical consistency with the unique token-processingcharacteristics of ViT to enhance fine-grained radiographicrepresentation (Fig. 1(b)). These alignments are also piv-otal in anomaly-specific restoration for preserving pixel-level anatomy-associated (i.e., geometrical) information.Based on the analysis above, we propose a novelAnatomy-driven self-supervised framework to enhanceFine-grainedRepresentationinradiographicimages(AFiRe). Equipped with the designed Synthetic LesionMasks (SLMs), an anatomy augmentation inspired byAnatPaste (Sato et al. 2023), AFiRe aligns ViT tokens withlocal anatomical structures via synergistically performingtwo SSL tasks: Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastivelearning and Pixel-level anomaly-removal restoration.For the contrastive learning task, instead of analyzing en-tire images, AFiRe processes each disjoint token in ViT asan independent sample. By maximizing mutual informationamong these tokens within a batch, this task learns fine-grained structural invariance and discriminative semanticsbased on structural and categorical consistency. To guide themodel in comprehensively learning the normal anatomicalpatterns, we introduce a group of spatial-aware prototypesin this task. These prototypes represent the distribution ofdifferent anatomical structures, serving as pseudo-cluster as-signments for the predicted token probabilities. For the pixelrestoration task, we strategically focus on restoring specificabnormal tokens augmented by SLMs. Concretely, we re-move these abnormal tokens by substituting them with train-able masked tokens to restore their corresponding normalpixels. Hence, the latent representations retain both normaland abnormal information while preserving geometrical de-tails closely associated with various anatomical structures.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AFiRe en-hances the model’s capacity to capture fine-grained dis-criminative information from normal radiographic images,facilitating a more robust representation across differentanatomic structures. Compared to different supervised andself-supervised benchmarks, AFiRe achieves superior per-formance in multi-label classification tasks, indicating itsgeneralization in analyzing real disease images. Further-more, AFiRe has observable advantages in three anomalydetection tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art counter-parts. Overall, our contributions are as follows:• We design a Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastivelearning SSL task, equipped with spatial-aware proto-types to integrate fine-grained anatomical discriminationbased on structural and categorical consistency.• We design a Pixel-level anomaly-removal restorationSSL task to preserve detailed geometrical informationclosely associated with various anatomical structures.• We introduce Synthetic Lesion Mask, an efficientanatomical data augmentation technique, to enhanceanatomical diversity while preserving intra-consistency.• We propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised frame-work that synergistically optimizes the aforementionedtasks to achieve robust radiographic representation withfine-grained anatomical information.RELATED WORKSSL has become a prominent topic in medical image anal-ysis, enabling the extraction of meaningful representationsdirectly from data without the need for explicit disease-specific labels. In this section, we review recent advance-ments that are most relevant to our proposed AFiRe method.Medical Contrastive Learning. This approach typi-cally uses encoders to cluster instances within the pseudo-classes (Sowrirajan et al. 2021; Azizi et al. 2021; Vu et al.2021). Recent research, including C2L (Zhou et al. 2020)adapts general contrastive methods to learn distinctive pat-terns across various medical images. Adamv1 (Hossein-zadeh Taher, Gotway, and Liang 2023) applies hierarchicalcontrastive learning, capturing anatomy in a coarse-to-finemanner. Adamv2 (Taher, Gotway, and Liang 2024) expandsit by enhancing radiographic representation with localizabil-ity, composability, and decomposability. While these meth-ods show effective applications in medical tasks, they re-main focused on image-level discrimination based on the in-put, neglecting the fine-grained anatomical information thatcould be aligned with token-level representations.Medical Restorative Learning. This approach recon-structs original images from corrupted versions, enhanc-ing pixel-level details to identify normal anatomy and var-ious abnormalities (Haghighi et al. 2024). Key advance-ments include Model Genesis (MG) (Zhou et al. 2021b),which uses image restoration tasks on unlabeled medicalimages; TransVW (Haghighi et al. 2021), which definesRDNormalhixiMixiyS2,izS3,izS1-L,izSL,izS2,izS3,izS1-L,izSL,izTask Ⅰ Task Ⅱ Anatomy augmentationPrototypes updatingUMask token selectionMNo gradientDiscriminative token selectionDreconLcstLT, jizS, jizjiM ,GenerateUPrototypesPatchify&Binarize MEncoderSESynthetic Lesion MaskEncoderTEEncoderTES, jizAbnormal1, =jiM0, =jiMnormalabnormalmaskzS, jiz1, =jiM0, =jiMnormalabnormalmaskzS, jizS,~jizLjjiz1S, }~{=Network forwardjcS, jiqT, jiqSoftMaxSin.Kno.Figure 2: Overview of the proposed AFiRe.

For each normal input xi, weperturb it using the designed Synthetic Lesion Mask (Mi) to produce abnormal input x′i. In Task I, a group of spatial-awareprototypes, updated by the teacher network’s output, serve as pseudo-cluster labels to maximize alignment among tokens fromstudent networks belonging to the same class or structure. In Task II, the restoration target particularly focuses on the abnormaltokens from augmented pairs of normal radiographic images by substituting them with mask tokens in the latent space.a “visual word” as a recurring anatomical segment acrossimages. SQUID (Xiang et al. 2023) leverages space-awarememory queues to capture spatial correlations and consis-tent anatomical structures in chest images, thereby demon-strating effectiveness in anomaly detection through unsu-pervised learning. AnatPaste (Sato et al. 2023) introducesanatomy-aware pasting augmentation, generating syntheticimages to distinguish real normal images with a one-classclassifier under SSL. These methods have shown promise inradiographic representation learning by preserving detailedpatterns; however, they are often suboptimal for radiographyclassification due to limited high-level discrimination.Medical Synergistic Learning. To harness complemen-tary advantages, synergistic SSL approaches have beenproposed for radiographic representation learning. DiRA(Haghighi et al. 2022) combines discriminative, restorative,and adversarial learning to capture complementary visual in-formation, enhancing fine-grained semantic representationlearning. PCRL (Zhou et al. 2021a) incorporates preserva-tion mechanisms to reconstruct diverse image contexts, re-fining the representations derived from contrastive methods.While these models offer progress, the proposed AFiReadvances the comprehensive integration of anatomical in-formation by introducing Token-Wise Anatomy-GuidedContrastive Learning and Pixel-Level Anomaly-RemovalRestoration, achieving both fine-grained high-level discrim-ination and preservation of pixel-level anatomical geometry.METHODTo enhance fine-grained anatomical representation in radio-graphic image analysis, we propose an anatomy-driven self-supervised framework as depicted in Fig. 2. Our frame-work employs a siamese ViT architecture to extract fea-tures from real normal and generated abnormal imagesby introducing the Synthetic Lesion Mask. Based on thealignment of anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of ViT, this framework syner-gistically performs two SSL tasks: (i) Task I, the Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learning, aims to enhancefine-grained discriminative information by maximizing mu-tual information among individual image tokens within thesame class or anatomical structure; and (ii) Task II, thePixel-level anomaly-removal restoration, aims to incorpo-rate geometric-based anatomical details by optimizing thealignment of abnormal tokens between the normal imageand its reconstructed counterpart at the pixel level.In the following, we introduce each component individu-ally and then discuss the synergistic training scheme.Feature Extraction with Siamese NetworkAs shown in Fig. 2, the overall structure of the AFiRe com-prises a student branch and a teacher branch. In our train-ing scheme, the student network ES, parameterized by θS,is trained to match the spatial-aware prototypes updated bythe output of the teacher network ET, parameterized by θT.Both networks share identical ViT architectures. During thepre-training phase, only θS is updated via back-propagation,while θT is updated using an exponential moving average(EMA) (He et al. 2020; Caron et al. 2021) of θS as follows:θT ←λθT + (1 −λ)θS,(1)where λ follows a cosine schedule from 0.99 to 1.To leverage the anatomical consistency observed in nor-mal radiographic images (Xiang et al. 2023), we incorporatetwo types of input data during the pre-training stage: (i) Realnormal images {xi}Bi=1, which provide a baseline to estab-lish the distribution of typical anatomical structures, and (ii)Synthetic abnormal images {x′i}Bi=1, which integrate cate-gory discriminative information by simulating pathologiesusing Synthetic Lesion Masks. Here, B represents the batchsize, and the images xi and x′i are encoded by the teachernetwork ET and the student network ES, respectively.Alignment anatomical consistency with ViT tokens.ViTs process input images as sequences of non-overlappingpatches, with the extracted features {zTi,j}Lj=1 and {zSi,j}Lj=1(white blocks in Fig 2) corresponding to token-wise","Current self-supervised methods, such as contrastive learn-ing, predominantly focus on global discrimination, neglect-ing the critical fine-grained anatomical details required foraccurate radiographic analysis. To address this challenge,we propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised frameworkfor enhancing Fine-grained Representation in radiographicimage analysis (AFiRe). The core idea of AFiRe is toalign the anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifi-cally, AFiRe synergistically performs two self-supervisedschemes: (i) Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learn-ing, which aligns image tokens based on structural and cat-egorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained spatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removalrestoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies,thereby refining the learned discrimination with detailed geo-metrical information.

How-ever, existing RAG frameworks primarily relyon semantic similarity and correlation-drivenretrieval, limiting their ability to distinguishtrue causal relationships from spurious associ-ations. This results in responses that may befactually grounded but fail to establish cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incompleteor misleading insights.To address this is-sue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedbackfor Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation(CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improvecausal consistency, factual accuracy, and ex-plainability in generative reasoning.CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves struc-tured causal graphs, and enables multi-hopcausal reasoning across interconnected knowl-edge sources.Additionally, it validates re-sponses against causal pathways, ensuring log-ically coherent and factually grounded out-puts. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four diversedatasets, demonstrating its ability to improveresponse accuracy and causal correctness overexisting RAG-based methods.Our code ispublicly available at https://github.com/elakhatibi/CDF-RAG.1IntroductionLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), DeepSeek (Liu et al.,2024), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) havedemonstrated strong performance across a rangeof reasoning tasks, including fact-based questionanswering (Liang et al., 2022), commonsense in-ference (Huang et al., 2019), and multi-hop re-trieval (Yang et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2024).Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (et al.,*Ziyu Wang and Elahe Khatibi contributed equally to thiswork.2020) has been introduced to enhance LLMs byretrieving external documents, thereby improv-ing response reliability in knowledge-intensivetasks (Wei et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). How-ever, conventional RAG pipelines typically relyon static queries and semantic similarity-based re-trieval, which prioritize topically relevant docu-ments rather than those that provide explanatory orcausal insights (Jiang et al., 2024; Chi et al., 2024).While effective for shallow fact recall, these strate-gies often fall short in tasks requiring multi-stepcausal reasoning (Vashishtha et al.; Jin et al., 2023).This reliance on correlation-driven retrieval in-troduces key challenges for causality-aware rea-soning. Traditional RAG systems (as shown inFigure 1) struggle to distinguish between statisti-cal associations and true causal relationships (Chiet al., 2024), leading to retrieved evidence thatmay appear relevant but lacks directional or ex-planatory depth. Furthermore, LLMs trained onlarge-scale observational corpora tend to model co-occurrence patterns rather than causal dependen-cies, making them prone to conflating correlationwith causation—especially in the presence of in-complete or ambiguous evidence. These limitationsbecome more pronounced in multi-hop retrieval,where linking causally related pieces of informa-tion is essential for producing coherent reasoningchains (Zhuang et al., 2024). However, conven-tional retrieval strategies typically employ flat orlexical matching techniques, which fail to incorpo-rate causal structure, leading to responses that arelocally plausible yet globally inconsistent.Such shortcomings have direct consequences inreal-world applications where causal understand-ing is critical. In medical decision-making, for in-stance, associating “high BMI” with “heart disease”may be factually accurate but incomplete withoutidentifying mediating factors such as “hyperten-sion” or “insulin resistance.” When causal evidenceis sparse or incorrectly retrieved, LLMs often com-arXiv:2504.12560v1 [cs.CL] 17 Apr 2025🔴 Why does diabetes damage elderly kidneys?Lexical RetrievalStatic QueriesHallucinated & Incoherent ResponsesDiabetes damages elderly kidneys by causing ❌excessive insulin buildup, leading to kidney scarring and reduced function…Conventional Fixed RAG Pipelines🔴 Why does diabetes damage elderly kidneys?🟢 Does diabetes cause kidney damage?🟢 How does aging impair kidney function?🟢 How does diabetes accelerate kidney damage in the elderly?Adaptive Query OptimizationCausal-Aware Retrieval✅Diabetes can damage the kidneys over time due to high blood sugar levels, which impair blood vessels and reduce kidney function.

Addition-ally, static query formulation prevents models fromadapting retrieval based on reasoning gaps, fur-ther exacerbating these issues. While recent workhas explored structured retrieval (Jin et al., 2024),multi-hop planning (Ferrando et al., 2024), andcausal graph construction (et al., 2024), these ap-proaches address isolated components rather thanproviding an end-to-end framework for causal rea-soning.Another key challenge in causal question an-swering is that many user queries in QA arealso vague or underspecified, making effective re-trieval even more challenging. While methods likeRQ-RAG (Chan et al., 2024), RAG-Gym (et al.,2025), and SmartRAG (Gao et al., 2024) intro-duce query refinement or agentic retrieval mech-anisms, they lack dynamic adaptation and causalalignment—often retrieving shallow or loosely con-nected content. This highlights the need for refine-ment strategies that are explicitly optimized forcausal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose CausalDynamic Feedback for Retrieval-AugmentedGeneration (CDF-RAG), a novel framework thatintegrates reinforcement-learned query refinement,multi-hop causal graph retrieval, and alignment-based hallucination detection into a dynamic rea-soning loop. These components enable CDF-RAGto retrieve causally relevant evidence and gener-ate logically coherent responses grounded in causalstructures. Our experiments on CosmosQA (Huanget al., 2019), MedQA (Jin et al., 2020), MedM-CQA (Pal et al., 2022), and AdversarialQA (Bar-tolo et al., 2020) show that CDF-RAG consis-tently outperforms standard and refined RAG mod-els (Chan et al., 2024; et al., 2025) across keymetrics—demonstrating its effectiveness for gen-erating factually consistent and causally coherentresponses in complex QA settings– providing arobust foundation for trustworthy reasoning in real-world applications.Contributions. Our paper makes the followingcontributions:• We introduce CDF-RAG, a unified frameworkthat integrates causal query refinement, multi-hop causal graph retrieval, and hallucinationdetection into a dynamic feedback loop forcausality-aware generation.• We demonstrate that our reinforcement learn-ing (RL)-based query rewriting significantlyenhances multi-hop causal reasoning and re-trieval quality, outperforming prior refinementapproaches.• We show that CDF-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on four QA benchmarks, withconsistent improvements in causal correctness,consistency, and interpretability over existingRAG-based models.2CDF-RAG: Causal Dynamic Feedbackfor RAGWe introduce CDF-RAG, a causality-aware exten-sion of RAG. As illustrated in Figure 2, the sys-tem refines user queries via a query refinementLLM trained with RL, retrieves knowledge using adual-path retrieval mechanism, rewrites knowledge,and applies a causal graph check to ensure fac-tual consistency. By integrating structured causalreasoning, CDF-RAG mitigates hallucinations andenhances interpretability. This approach enablesdynamic query adaptation and precise retrieval forcausal reasoning tasks. Implementation details canbe found in Appendix A2.1Causal Knowledge Graph ConstructionCDF-RAG constructs a directed causal knowledgegraph G = (V, E) from textual data to capturecausal dependencies beyond correlation. UsingUniCausal (Tan et al., 2023), a BERT-based classi-fier extracts cause-effect pairs formatted as C →E,processing annotated inputs <ARG0> and <ARG1> topredict ˆy = g(r[CLS]).To ensure logical validity, extracted causal pairsare verified by GPT-4 before being encoded intoG as directed triples (C, E, relation). The graphstructure enables multi-hop reasoning over causalmechanisms, ensuring retrieved knowledge sup-ports causal inference tasks.2.2Causal Query Refinement viaReinforcement LearningGiven an initial user query q, CDF-RAG appliesRL to generate a refined query ˆq optimized forcausal retrieval. The RL-based query refinementagent models this as a Markov Decision Process(MDP), where the state s represents the queryembedding, and the agent selects an action a ∈{expand, simplify, decompose}. Expansion en-hances specificity by adding relevant causal fac-tors, simplification removes extraneous details, anddecomposition restructures complex queries intoatomic subqueries.The policy πθ(a | s) is initialized via supervisedfine-tuning (SFT) on labeled refinement examples:LSFT = −TXt=1log Pϕ(yt | y<t, x)and further optimized using Proximal Policy Opti-mization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017):LPPO(θ) = Etmin",Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has

We perform an ablation study across varying hiddendimensions for both the Default MoE and a Top-K baseline approach. We plot the perplexity across3 hidden dimensions: 512, 1024 and 2048. Notably, the Default MoE consistently outperforms theTop-K baseline across all model sizes, demonstrating lower perplexity at every scale. We compare thetraining efficiency of Default MoE and Top-K by measuring the number of tokens required to reach atarget perplexity. Since Default MoE uses an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of previous expertoutputs to supplement the router during training, it requires fewer tokens to reach the same perplexityas Top-K.tokens. We see in Figure 4 that our method significantly outperforms SparseMixer for at least thefirst 10B tokens.4.3AblationsWe now ablate every setting in our experimental setup, from the model architecture to the learningrate.Default MoE Remains Superior As We Increase the Model Size. Figure 5 compares the twomethods as we increase the size of the model from 557M total parameters at a hidden dimensionof 512, to 7.33B total parameters when the hidden dimension is 2048. Our method outperforms thebaseline across all model sizes. All other results in the paper use a hidden dimension of 1024 becausethis model is fairly easy to train with just data parallelism.MoE Architecture Ablations. We apply Default MoE with different expert configurations corre-sponding to various levels of sparsity, using NcK to refer to a model with N total experts and K activeexperts. When increasing the number of experts past 8, we fine-grain experts (Dai et al., 2024) sothat the total number of model parameters remains constant. Specifically, the intermediate size isnow 704 rather than 2816 because we have 4× the number of experts). In Figure 6, we train botha standard Top-K model and Default MoE with the configurations 8c1, 8c2, 32c1, 32c2, and 32c4,which correspond to sparsity factors of 1/8, 1/4, 1/32, 1/16 and 1/8 respectively.7Default MoE outperforms a standard TopK MoE at all sparsity configurations. Our improvement ismore pronounced for the lowest sparsity (8c2) but still significant for higher sparsity MoEs such as32c1. Notably, Default MoE takes longer to ”warm up” for sparser models; for example, in Figure 6the 32c1 Default MoE rapidly catches up and surpasses the TopK MoE around the 10 billion tokenmark, while the 32c2 MoE is clearly ahead of TopK even at 2 billion tokens.While we use β = 0.9 for the 8c1 and 8c2 MoEs in Figure 6, β requires more careful tuning for the32 expert MoEs. For N = 32, we use β = 0.65, β = 0.95, and β = 0.999 for K = 1, K = 2, andK = 4 respectively. In other words, sparser MoEs require a lower β. We believe this is due to eachexpert receiving less tokens at each step, which leads to a sparser ”history” for each default vector. Asa result, the default vector’s estimate for the average expert output improves when assigning higherweight to the current batch.2B4B6B8B10BTokens2426283032Default MoETopK8c18c232c132c232c4Figure 6: Comparison of Default MoE andTop-K Across Different Configurations. Wecompare Default MoE and Top-K across fiveconfigurations: 8c1, 8c2, 32c1, 32c2, and 32c4.The results show that Default MoE outperformsTop-K in all MoE configurations. Both 8c1 and8c2 use β = 0.9; however, 32c1, 32c2, and 32c4require more careful tuning of β. We use β =0.65, β = 0.95, and β = 0.999 for 32c1, 32c2,and 32c4, respectively. We detail our choices ofβ in Appendix A.1.2B4B6B8B10BTokens222426283032Default MoETopK9e-47e-43e-45e-4Figure 7: Learning Rate Sweep for Top-K andDefault MoE. We perform a learning rate sweepfor the Top-K approach to determine the largeststable learning rate, which is then used for De-fault MoE. The results show that while Top-Kstruggles with higher learning rates—evidencedby poor performance at 9×10−4—Default MoEremains stable and can effectively utilize largerlearning rates.This is demonstrated by De-fault MoE achieving comparable performanceat 9 × 10−4 to Top-K at 7 × 10−4, highlightingits greater training stability.Tuning the Learning Rate. We want to ensure that we are comparing against a tuned baseline, sowe tune the learning rates in Figure 7. We use the learning rate that achieves the best performancefor the TopK baseline, 7 × 10−4, for our main results in Figure 3. However, this is actually not thebest learning rate for the Default MoE; the larger learning rate of 9 × 10−4 is slightly better. Bycontrast, 9 × 10−4 is much too large for the baseline. This indicates that our Default MoE is morestable to train, likely because we are updating the entire router. If we train the baseline with sucha large learning rate, we see that a single iteration with a very imbalanced load will lead to a largeloss spike; this iteration is very noticeable because, since we train dropless MoEs, it is also slower.We never observe this for the Default MoE. It is unsurprising that our Default MoE’s best learningrates may be different from the baseline, but importantly, our method outperforms the baseline at alllearning rates we consider.We present additional ablations regarding the EMA, including the hyperparameter β, the EMAinitialization, and passing the EMA value forward, in Appendix A.1.4.4EfficiencyOur Method Does Not Significantly Reduce Throughput. In Table 2 we report the throughputin samples per second and of TopK and our method while training the standard 8-expert MoE ona single GPU node. Our method is quite lightweight, because we just need to update an EMA inthe forward pass and then update the router gradients in the backward pass. However, for the 2Bmodel we train, this is still nearly a 2% overhead; less than the 9% speedup we observe over theTopK baseline in Figure 3, but still non-zero. We find that the overhead of our method decreases as8Table 2: Throughput Comparison. We compare the throughput between our method and the TopKbaseline for different model sizes. Throughput is measured in tokens per second (sequence length2048) on a single GPU.HiddenModelTokens per secondOverhead vs TopKDimSizeTopKOurs10241.96B26,39325,913-1.85%20487.33B1,3931,391-0.18%we increase the hidden size. The 2B model we train has 1024 hidden size, 2048 hidden size is an 8Bmodel, etc. As the hidden size increases, the proportion of time spent in the MLP matmuls increases,and the overhead of our model is no longer significant compared to the total MoE layer runtime. Foreven just an 8B model, our overhead is near-zero; and of course, this is almost 100× smaller thanproduction MoEs (DeepSeek-AI Team, 2024b). We are confident that our lightweight EMA methoddoes not reduce throughput at scale.Our Method Does Not Significantly Increase the Memory Footprint. The EMA buffers are notupdated during the backward pass, so we don’t need to store any additional activations. The onlyadditional memory required by our method is the EMA buffers themselves. For each expert in eachlayer, we store a buffer of the same size as the model’s hidden dimension. The total number ofparameters in an expert is hidden size×intermediate size; for our MoE this is 1024×2816. Andwe are just increasing this by 1024, which is a 1/2816 = 0.03% increase in the number of parameters.The MoE parameters are not the entirety of the model (they are about 3/4) so the additional memoryfootprint of our method is negligible.5DiscussionWe propose a training method to improve language modeling performance for MoEs. By approximat-ing the signal of a dense mixture-of-experts layer, the MoE router is able to receive information fromall experts for each token, regardless of how many were activated. This approximated dense signalallows our Default MoE to outperform the standard Top-K baseline in a variety of settings. Moreover,the Default MoE requires minimal added computational overhead which decreases as the model sizegrows larger, showcasing the potential of our method for large-scale MoE pretraining.6AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the Capital One AGI Foundations Team and in particular Andrei Mircea,Stephen Rawls, and Sambit Sahu for helpful discussions and support for the paper.

Leveraging their inherent reasoning ca-pabilities, these models have also shown promising potential inmultimodal mathematical reasoning [25, 28]. However, their appli-cation to Geometry Problem Solving (GPS) remains challenging.As a long-standing problem in the AI community, GPS represents a1arXiv:2504.12773v1 [cs.CL] 17 Apr 2025Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYicheng Pan, Zhenrong Zhang, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Jun Du, Jianshu Zhang, Quan Liu, Jianqing Gao, and Feng Macomplex form of multimodal mathematical reasoning [6, 22, 39]. Ina typical plane geometry problem, an automatic solver is requiredto produce the correct answer or reasoning process based on a givendiagram and textual question. This task demands fine-grained visualunderstanding (e.g., identifying points, lines and angles) [38] andmulti-step theorem-based reasoning [22], posing unique challengesdistinct from other mathematical reasoning tasks.Existing MLLM solvers for GPS primarily rely on supervisedfine-tuning (SFT) paradigms using chain-of-thought (CoT) super-vision [19, 28, 30, 45]. However, high-quality reasoning processesin natural language are scarce in public geometry datasets [22, 25],which poses a significant bottleneck to the effective SFT of MLLMs,and limits their reasoning capabilities. While existing approachesattempt to construct more CoT data through template-based gener-ation [16, 40] or large language model (LLM) synthesis (e.g. GPT-4o)[3, 12, 14, 36], significant challenges persist. Template-driven meth-ods suffer from rigid formatting constraints that restrict contentdiversity and real-world applicability [10]. Meanwhile, solutionsgenerated by LLMs exhibit inherent uncertainty in output quality.On the other hand, symbolic-based approaches for GPS havedemonstrated strong effectiveness [22, 26, 32]. Through specified ge-ometry formal language, symbolic systems can conduct precise sym-bolic reasoning to derive solutions via searching and executing ge-ometry theorems in a structured manner [41]. However, such meth-ods heavily rely on manually crafted rules, limiting their scalabilityand adaptability [10]. Some recent efforts have attempted to com-bine LLMs with symbolic systems, where the general knowledgeof LLMs are used to guide the symbolic search process [8, 29, 43].Nonetheless, these approaches primarily enhance the symbolic sys-tem, rather than improving the intrinsic geometric problem-solvingabilities of the language model itself. Overall, the integration ofsymbolic systems and LLMs remains an underexplored direction inthe context of geometry problem solving.In this work, we find that the in MLLMs with symbolic systemscan effectively alleviate the data scarcity issue discussed above.To be specific, the symblic system are capable of applying searchalgorithms and uncover a wide range of potential geometric re-lationships within a single diagram [41]. This insight enables theexpansion of a single geometry image into multiple problem-solvingtargets, thereby increasing the effective volume of training data.Furthermore, due to strong language modeling capabilities, LLMscan serve as a bridge between natural language and formal language[23]. This translation capability serves as a foundation for integrat-ing the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and vision-languageunderstanding.Based on the above observations, we propose GeoGen, a novelpipeline that automatically construct geometric multi-step CoTdata leveraging both LLM and symbolic system. Our pipeline en-ables automatic synthesis of geometry diagrams based on formallanguage, as well as automatic annotation for both synthesizedand public images with multi-step reasoning data. GeoGen firstperforms precise symbolic reasoning and generate reasoning pathswith guaranteed correctness. Next, GeoGen leverages the externalLLMs to translate structured reasoning paths into coherent naturallanguage explanations. Based on this pipeline, we further annotateand synthesize two datasets: GeoExpand and GeoSynth. GeoEx-pand dataset is created with 45k solutions by expanding upon theimages from existing datasets [22, 39]. Additionally, we constructGeoSynth dataset from scratch producing 62k images along withQ&A pairs to further increase the training scale and diversity. Com-pared to other geometry diagram synthesis methods [16, 40], ourconstructed datasets incorporate richer geometric knowledge andmore detailed multi-step reasoning, providing stronger supervisionfor training geometry-solving models.To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of MLLMsin GPS, we view symbol systems as function tools for MLLMs, andintroduce GeoLogic. Leveraging the general language capabilitiesof LLMs [1, 15, 31, 44], GeoLogic is trained on formal–natural lan-guage solution pairs generated by GeoGen, and learns to translatenatural language solutions into formal representations required bysymbolic solvers. This capability equips the model to treat symbolicsystems as external tools that can be invoked to support reasoning.In practice, we take an initial step toward this integration by usingsymbolic systems to verify MLLM predictions step by step. This ver-ification process enforces alignment between the model’s outputsand geometric principles, making the reasoning more reliable.Our overall framework of integration methods is illustrated inFigure 1. During the training phase, we conduct extensive SFTexperiments using public and synthetic data. Comprehensive eval-uations of SFT on our datasets validate their effectiveness, showingconsistent improvements across various MLLMs and achieving re-markable performance across multiple geometry benchmarks. Inthe inference phase, we leverage GeoLogic along with the veri-fication capabilities of the symbolic system. A tree-based searchis performed, which enables step-by-step validation on MLLM’sprediction, reducing reasoning errors and hallucinations.(1) We propose GeoGen, a symbolic-based pipeline that can au-tomatically generate step-by-step solutions for both existingdatasets and synthetic diagrams.(2) We further construct GeoExpand and GeoSynth dataset, con-taining 45K and 62K questions respectively, each accompa-nied by multi-step reasoning solutions.(3) We introduce GeoLogic, which enables the integration ofsymbolic systems as verifiers during MLLM inference, en-hancing the rigor and reliability of the reasoning process.(4) Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach in both training and inference phases.2RELATED WORK2.1Geometry Problem SolvingGeometry Problem Solving (GPS) has long been a challenging taskin the field of artificial intelligence [9, 22, 27], representing a com-plex form of multimodal mathematical reasoning. Before the riseof LLMs, approaches to GPS were generally divided into two cate-gories: symbolic solvers and neural solvers.Symbolic solvers perform precise reasoning by searching forand applying geometric theorems in a structured manner. The In-terGPS and Geometry3K datasets [22] provide high-quality formallanguage annotations and support theorem-based symbolic rea-soning. FormalGeo [41] combines theorem execution with searchalgorithms, introducing a more diverse set of geometric rules andoffering more detailed formal annotations. In addition, Inter-GPS[22], E-GPS [32], GeoDRL [26] and HyperGNet [42] train dedicated2Enhancing the Geometric Problem-Solving Ability of Multimodal LLMs via Symbolic-Neural IntegrationConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAneural networks to guide theorem search, while PI-GPS [43] lever-ages the capabilities of external LLMs to assist symbolic solversby predicting theorem sequences and generating structured repre-sentations of problem texts. However, all these methods share theinherent limitations of symbolic systems, as they often rely heavilyon manually crafted rules [33] and formally annotated data, whichlimits their scalability and adaptability. In contrast, our method alsoincorporates symbolic systems, but primarily as an enhancementto MLLMs, rather than relying on symbolic reasoning as the core.Neural methods, on the other hand, adopt end-to-end neuralnetworks to predict program sequences composed of computationaloperators and elements [18, 34]. These sequences are then executedby an external program executor to derive numerical answers. NGS[6], DPE-NGS [6] and Geoformer [5] design geometry-specific neu-ral modules along with pretraining tasks, and introduce datasetsof GeoQA, GeoQA+ and UniGeo. PGPSNet [39] extracts geometricinformation from diagrams into clauses[13], enabling better multi-modal fusion, and proposes PGPS9K dataset. GeoX [33] introducesmulti-stage pretraining strategies on ViT and LLM to better align vi-sual features with reasoning, achieving strong performance. Whilethese methods aim to predict program sequences and offer a degreeof interpretability, their outputs are still not naturally readable andremain distant from truly natural language solutions [24]. In com-parison, our approach focuses on enhancing the ability of MLLMsto solve geometry problems directly in natural language, leadingto better human readability and greater scalability.2.2MLLMs for Geometry Problem SolvingMultimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o [14]and the Qwen VL series [2], have demonstrated remarkable capa-bilities in integrating visual and textual information, opening upnew opportunities for GPS task. To adapt these models to domain-specific reasoning tasks, SFT has emerged as the predominant ap-proach. However, the effectiveness of SFT in such tasks is oftenconstrained by the quality of CoT reasoning data [30], which israrely exist in earlier geometry datasets such as Geometry3K [22]and PGPS9K [39]. To overcome data limitations, some approachesexplore template-based or LLM-based pipelines to construct large-scale SFT training data. G-LLaVA [12] expands the annotated datain GeoQA [6] and Geometry3K by leveraging LLMs to rephraseexisting annotations. However, it underutilizes other datasets andsuffers from limited label diversity. GeomVerse [16] and MAVIS [40]employ Python engines to generate artificially rendered geometricimages. However, these synthetic images still differ significantlyfrom real-world scenarios, and the reasoning paths they provideoften lack rich geometric knowledge. Similarly, GeoGPT4V [3] uti-lizes GPT-4V to generate new problems and corresponding codefor synthetic image construction. R-CoT [10] constructs a largenumber of synthetic images and uses image captions along with anLLM-based Reverse Chain-of-Thought pipeline to generate solutionpaths. While promising, such LLM-generated data might containmistakes, and the correctness of the synthesized reasoning stepsrequires further evaluation.In contrast, our GeoGen pipeline offers several advantages: First,it leverages existing symbolic systems and performs precise sym-bolic reasoning, which enables it to integrate seamlessly with publicdatasets to fully exploit existing resources, and generate solutionpaths with guaranteed correctness. Second, GeoGen automaticallysynthesizes geometric diagrams from formal language expressions,allowing it to represent a wider range of geometric concepts andknowledge.3METHODSIn this section, we present our approach to integrating symbolicsystems with MLLMs during both training and inference. As illus-trated in Figure 1, our framework consists of two key components:(1) the GeoGen pipeline, which automatically construct CoT rea-soning data, and (2) GeoLogic, a bridging module that enables theMLLM to interact with the symbolic system during inference.Before detailing our methodology, we first state several key con-cepts, following previous work [22]. A predicate denotes a class ofgeometric relationships, such as IsMidpointOfLine, which indi-cates that a point is the midpoint of a line segment. A literal refers toa instance of a predicate. for example, IsMidpointOfLine(P,AB),which states that in this geometric diagram, point P is the midpointof segment AB.3.1GeoGen PipelineGeoGen implements a data synthesis pipeline inspired by Alpha-Geometry [29], including random premise sampling, symbolic de-duction with traceback, and synthetic problems, As shown in Figure2. In particular, We design the Plotter module to randomly samplegeometric conditions and render corresponding diagrams usingOpenCV. We also design a Target Finder module that leveragessymbolic systems to perform forward search and traceback in orderto retrieve solution path. Finally, we apply rule-based generationand external LLMs to convert the structured results into naturallanguage questions and solutions.3.1.1Plotter. We design a plotter module to perform randompremise sampling and automatically generate large-scale geometricdiagrams. Specifically, we begin by sampling a combination of geo-metric predicates, which typically include one entity predicate (e.g.square or isosceles triangle) and one or more relation predicates(e.g. midpoint or median). These predicates are then instantiatedinto literals by assigning letter labels (e.g., point names like A, B, C)to the corresponding entities. To introduce additional complexity,we further randomly add line segments between sampled points.Based on the geometric semantics of each predicate, we constructa group of equations that constraint the coordinates of the relevantpoints. The coordinates are either directly computed or randomlyassigned under the constraints from these equations. Finally, thediagrams are rendered using OpenCV, yielding clean, scalable geo-metric figures. Since every diagram is generated from a well-definedset of predicates, the resulting diagrams are naturally aligned withgeometry predicates and embeds rich geometric knowledge.3.1.2Target Finder. To identify potential goals from geometricimages, the Target Finder module performs forward search using abreadth-first strategy. In symbolic system, a theorem becomes appli-cable when its premises are satisfied by existing literals. Specifically,we begin with an initial set of literals 𝐿0. By identifying premises,3Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYicheng Pan, Zhenrong Zhang, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Jun Du, Jianshu Zhang, Quan Liu, Jianqing Gao, and Feng MaNatural Language Soluon1.

Alyahya∗Saudi Data & AI AuthorityYazeed AlnumayCohereM Saiful BariSaudi Data & AI AuthorityBülent YenerRensselaer Polytechnic InstituteLarge Language Models (LLMs) are being developed at an unprecedented pace (Zhao et al.,2024), requiring significant investment for their training and refinement (Kevin Lee, 2024;Miller, 2022; Kimball, 2024). As the performance and complexity of these models continueto grow (Chen et al., 2024b), selecting the most appropriate model for a specific applicationhas become an increasingly challenging and costly decision (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmannet al., 2022). Benchmarking emerges as critical in this context (Laskar et al., 2023; Qin et al.,2023), providing standardized metrics and evaluations to guide these choices.Current benchmarking practices face several significant issues. Many benchmarks sufferfrom data contamination (Yang et al., 2023), where models inadvertently train on portionsof the test data (Dubey et al., 2024; Groeneveld et al., 2024), leading to inflated performancemetrics. Sensitivity to prompt variations (Alzahrani et al., 2024) and a lack of diversityin evaluation tasks (Laskar et al., 2024) further undermine the reliability and robustnessof these benchmarks. Additionally, the high cost and effort required to develop newbenchmarks often result in outdated evaluation methods that do not keep pace with therapid development of LLMs (Kiela et al., 2021; Vu et al., 2023).An observed disparity exists between the computational resources measured in floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs used to train LLMs and those allocated for their∗Core contributors.

Training these models involves massive computational efforts (Hoffmannet al., 2022), yet the evaluation phase typically utilizes a negligible fraction of this capacity(Laskar et al., 2024). Scaling up evaluation by increasing the number of evaluation tokens isessential for a more thorough understanding of model capabilities. Traditionally, this scalinginvolves incorporating human-crafted data (Holland et al., 2018), which is resource-intensive(Hutchinson et al., 2021) and may not adequately capture the complexities of language(Mehrabi et al., 2021) and reasoning required to challenge advanced LLMs (Gudibande et al.,2023).Previous work has proposed the use of games as benchmarks (Topsakal et al., 2024), offeringa promising avenue for evaluating complex reasoning (Wong et al., 2023) and decision-making abilities of LLMs (Warstadt et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Gamesprovide interactive and dynamic environments that can test models beyond static datasets.However, existing game-based benchmarks are often (i) inflexible and limited in scope,(ii) not easily extendable, (iii) restricted in their effectiveness for comprehensive modelevaluation, and (iv) depend on predefined prompts.Scaling evaluation is fundamental not only for assessing performance but also for uncover-ing hidden dynamics within LLMs, such as potential backdoors or biases (Schuster et al.,2020), and for evaluating their emerging reasoning capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Sanhet al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023b;a). Implementing environments for simulations or games offersa scalable solution to these challenges (OpenAI et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2019; Silver et al., 2016;2017; Zheng et al., 2021).Existing evaluation protocols possess several key issues:• Limited Diversity: Traditional evaluation methods rely on static datasets, which areinherently limited by their dependency on human curation and annotation. This makes itchallenging to continuously introduce new, diverse test data.• Crowd and Annotator Bias: LLM evaluations conducted by large crowds often tend tobe susceptible to social hacking, and it can depend on geographic, temporal, and narrative2Preprint.

Controlled and interpretable environments can mitigatethese biases by providing consistent, objective evaluation criteria.• Sensitivity to Prompts: Previous work (Zheng et al., 2024; Pezeshkpour & Hruschka,2023; Lu et al., 2022; Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) has shown that modelsare sensitive to benchmark formats. These prompt modifications are shown to result insubstantially different relative performance between models (Alzahrani et al., 2024).• Saturation: With the rapid improvement of LLMs, evaluation benchmarks quickly be-come obsolete and saturated, with frontier models achieving almost perfect scores, whichnecessitates the development of new benchmarks. For instance, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)tests models on grade school-level math, and most state-of-the-art models achieve scoresabove 90% (Dubey et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2024). Thus, the more difficult MATH (Hendryckset al., 2021b) dataset, which consists of math competition questions, was developed and isnow commonly used 1. A similar trend is observed in academic examination benchmarkswith the migration from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) to MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b)and GPQA. (Rein et al., 2023)2.To address these challenges, we introduce ZEROSUMEVAL, an extensible open-source frame-work designed to evaluate LLMs through the simulation of multi-player zero-sum games.The evaluations in the framework naturally scale and resist saturation as model capabilitiesimprove.In this work, we show that ZEROSUMEVAL possesses the following properties:• Scalable Evaluation: We demonstrate how simulation environments can effectively scalethe evaluation process.• Dynamic Evaluation: Each game trace explores a different path in an almost infinitespace of move trajectories. Regurgitation of memorized information is penalized naturallyby threat of exploitation from opposing players.• Robustness to Prompt Sensitivity: Prompt writing is abstracted to the input/outputlevel for all models and feedback loops are used to eliminate the need for elaborate anddetailed prompts.• Enhanced Interpretability: Game traces reveals the strengths and weaknesses of modelsin ways static benchmarks cannot.2MethodologyIn this section, we describe the technical details of ZEROSUMEVAL including design choices,the game selection (including novel game types), and how prompting is abstracted. Atits core, ZEROSUMEVAL provides controlled environments to observe models competingagainst each other to win competitive games. In particular, ZSE controls (i) the role andinformation each model has access to at any point in the simulation and (ii) the feedbackmodels can use to correct mistakes and act successfully.2.1Game DesignZEROSUMEVAL supports an expanding suite of game types designed to test any aspectof LLM capabilities. The mix we showcase includes both well-known and establishedgames, such as Chess, Poker, and Liar’s Dice, as well as more special-purpose games (e.g.MathQuiz, Pyjail, and Gandalf). The following set of games are selected to encompass arange of capabilities, including strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, andcreativity:1HuggingFace’s Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023; Fourrier et al., 2024) migrated fromGSM8K in v1 to MATH in v2.2Similar to 1, the leaderboard transitioned from MMLU in v1 to MMLU-Pro and GPQA in v2.3Preprint.

Here deepseek-chat (white) executes a knight forkagainst llama3.3-70b (black) after which black loses the game by failing to produce a legalmove.Classic Games (Chess, Poker, Liar’s Dice)Classic board games like chess serve as abenchmark for strategic reasoning and long-term planning. They require models to engagein multi-step thinking, manage trade-offs, and foresee opponent moves. This category isuseful in evaluating a model’s ability to plan several moves ahead, adapt its strategies, andmake complex decisions under uncertainty3. A snippet of a Chess game trace is shown inFigure 2.Question-Answer Games (MathQuiz)These games are constructed to measure models’knowledge recall and logical reasoning abilities. MathQuiz, for instance, challenges modelsto both create and answer arithmetic and mathematical questions, assessing their under-standing of mathematical concepts, computational accuracy, and step-by-step problem-solving skills (see Figure 3 for an example). Our implementation of MathQuiz tasks ateacher player to create a challenging math problem and prove that the problem is validand solvable. A student player then attempts to answer the generated math problem. Thestudent wins the game by answering the question correctly or if the teacher fails to create avalid question.Conversational Games (Debate, Gandalf)These are games designed to assess models’creative capabilities. For example, Gandalf engages LLMs in scenarios where one playerattempts to break the conditioning/instruction following of another. In this game, a sentinelplayer is tasked to keep a randomly generated passphrase secret while conversing with aninfiltrator player. The infiltrator wins if the passphrase is revealed in the conversation andthe sentinel wins if the conversation exceeds a maximum number of turns (Pfister et al.,2025).Cybersecurity Games (PyJail)PyJail involves python “capture the flag” cybersecuritychallenges, targeting the model’s ability to create puzzles and interact with a restrictedpython environment to strategize solutions.

Now it isllama3.1-405b’s (student) turn to answer the question (which it fails to do after multipleattempts).three stages: generating a challenge, proving the challenge validity, and posing the challengeto the opponent.Details about these games can be found in Appendix A.1.2.2Scalable VerificationThe MathQuiz and PyJail games require competing models to generate valid and solvablechallenges. Since verification of the challenges by a human in the loop is not scalable,we design a method to verify model output using an automated manager in a two-foldgeneration and verification process. This is accomplished by defining a target outcome(e.g., the answer to a math question or a CTF flag) as the basis for verifying the generatedchallenge, and regulating the model context to prevent target leakage.The exact process (shown in Figure 4) is best illustrated with an example from MathQuiz(Figure 3):1. ZEROSUMEVAL Manager generates a random integer from (0,1000] as the target answer(439) and instructs the teacher (claude-3.7-sonnet) to generate a question.2. The teacher claude-3.7-sonnet generates the question ""Find the smallest prime numbergreater than 400 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6 and a remainder of 5 whendivided by 7.""3.Ensuring the target answer is not in the context, ZEROSUMEVAL Manager asksclaude-3.7-sonnet to answer its own question and verifies against the target answer. If thisstep succeeds, the game continues. Without access to the answer, there is a 1/1000 chancethe teacher will produce the target answer by randomly guessing.4. ZEROSUMEVAL Manager asks the student (llama-3.1-405b) to answer the question.5Preprint. Under review.This method ensures the generated challenge is valid and a solution is proven possible. Thedesign also correctly penalizes models that directly generate memorized questions as theyare likely to have been memorized by other models, thereby models that create challengingand novel questions are more likely to win.2.3Prompt Abstraction and FeedbackMManagerGGeneratorGenerate TargetVerificationMatch Target?Receive TargetGenerate ChallengeSolve ChallengeTargetClearFigure 4: State diagram of the verification pro-cess involving the ZSEval Manager and theLLM Generator.

ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocolthat leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarksthat resist saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games,including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar’s Dice,Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf,Debate). These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilitiessuch as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity.Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-basedevaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by pro-viding a standardized and extensible framework. To demonstrate this,we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 gamesand 13 models. Our results show that while frontier models from the GPTand Claude families can play common games and answer questions, theystruggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging ques-tions. We also observe that models cannot reliably jailbreak each otherand fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We release our code athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval."

CONCLUSIONIn this work, we introduced a novel dual-region data augmentation technique aimed at reducing reliance onlarge labeled datasets by leveraging targeted augmentation strategies. Specifically, our approach applies fore-ground noise integration and background patch shuffling. By separately augmenting these regions, our methodencourages robust feature learning, significantly improving model generalization across diverse scenarios. Thisaugmentation strategy effectively minimizes the need for extensive manual annotations.Experiments acrosssource-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID) tasks validate the effectiveness of ourmethod. Our method surpassed prior methods, significantly improving both single-target (84.0%) and multi-target (77.4%) adaptation accuracy. Additionally, our method outperformed baseline augmentations on standardperson ReID benchmarks, yielding considerable Rank@1 and mean Average Precision (mAP) improvements onMarket-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. By demonstrating that targeted data augmentations can enhance modelrobustness across different tasks, this work highlights a promising augmentation-based direction for reducingdependency on large-scale labeled data. Future work may refine these augmentation strategies, broaden theirapplicability to more diverse datasets, and evaluate their impact on other real-world computer vision applications.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by DEVCOM U.S. Army Research Laboratory through Booz Allen Hamilton undercontract W911QX-21-D-0001.REFERENCES[1] Quio˜nero-Candela, J., Sugiyama, M., Schwaighofer, A., and Lawrence, N.

Although existing works at-tempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-trainingor fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs withlarge datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance.This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training methodfor CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introducetwo techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hy-brid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the imageand text features to follow a shared prior distribution by min-imizing the distance to random reference vectors sampledfrom the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid softlabels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pairlabels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. Thiscontributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowl-edge and learning new knowledge to align features. Ourextensive experiments with multiple classification and re-trieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigatingthe modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance1.1. IntroductionContrastive language image pre-training (CLIP, [23, 42]) is astandard method to build modern vision-language foundationmodels. CLIP enables models to learn multimodal represen-tations to map images and texts into a shared feature spacewith contrastive loss on large-scale image-text pair datasets.Since the pre-trained CLIP models provide a cross-modalunderstanding of input image/text data in various domains,*Corresponding author. shinya.yamaguchi@ntt.com1Code: https://github.com/yshinya6/clip-refineOurApproachPrevious ApproachPre-trainingw/ CLIPPost-pre-training to Align Modality GapZero-shot Inferenceor Fine-tuningPre-trainingw/ CLIPZero-shot Inferenceor Fine-tuningFigure 1. Scope of our work: post-pre-training to align the modalitygap in pre-trained CLIP models. We aim to address the modalitygap and enhance the generalization performance of pre-trainedCLIP models through lightweight training.they are widely used as a foundation of many applications,including zero-shot classification [14, 42, 59], cross-modalretrieval [16, 22], text-to-image generation [43, 47], andvisual question answering [32, 33].While CLIP achieves remarkable performance in broaddomains and tasks, its image and text alignment is stillnot perfect. For example, CLIP models tend to encodeimages and texts into different clusters for each modality,and thus, there is a modality gap between images and textfeatures even after sufficiently training with the massivedatasets [30, 41, 70]. This modality gap suggests that CLIPhas difficulty in precisely mapping images and text. In fact,Liang et al. [30] have shown that the modality gap largelyaffects downstream task performance, especially in fine-grained classification tasks, and Ray et al. [45] have demon-strated that CLIP models often fail to retrieve localized ob-jects and attributes in images from corresponding captions.To address the modality gap in CLIP, existing literaturemainly focuses on refining the CLIP feature spaces in thepre-training or fine-tuning phases. For pre-training, one ap-proach is multi-task learning of the contrastive objective andauxiliary losses such as self-supervised loss with data aug-mentations [28, 29]. Another direction for pre-training is toreduce the modality gap by modifying the encoder architec-tures to explicitly share the weights or feature maps betweenthe image and text encoders [6, 68]. For fine-tuning, previ-ous works have demonstrated that the target downstream taskperformance can be improved significantly by prompt tuningthat optimizes trainable visual/textual tokens on target tasksto match image and text in the feature space (i.e., reducingthe modality gap) [25, 35, 72]. More recently, Yang et al.[66] have introduced adapter parameters to share the infor-1arXiv:2504.12717v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025mation across modalities. This cross-modal shared adapteris fine-tuned to solve the target tasks.Although these pre-training/fine-tuning methods succeedin improving the cross-modal alignment capability, they facedifficulties in terms of computational cost and zero-shottransfer performance. On the one hand, pre-training methodsrequire training from scratch with million-scale image-textdatasets like LAION-400M [49]. Since the previous worksoften do not publish pre-trained models using such largedatasets, naïve CLIP models published by OpenAI [42] orOpenCLIP [8] are still a practical choice under the limitedbudget. On the other hand, fine-tuning methods do not re-quire huge computation costs because their datasets are muchsmaller than pre-training ones. Nevertheless, fine-tuning pre-trained CLIP models degrades the general zero-shot transferperformance due to focusing on target tasks [27]. This isinevitable as the primary goal of fine-tuning is to improvethe target task performance. Therefore, we seek a new ap-proach that is lighter than pre-training and avoids degradingzero-shot transfer performance in fine-tuning.In this paper, we tackle aligning the image and text fea-tures of CLIP models in a training phase called post-pre-training between pre-training and fine-tuning (Fig. 1). Thegoal of post-pre-training is to mitigate the modality gap andenhance zero-shot transfer performance of off-the-shelf pre-trained CLIP models by only using reasonable computationresources and datasets (e.g., a single GPU and COCO Cap-tions [31]). This is challenging because naïve alignmentmethods, such as directly minimizing the gap between im-age and text features, corrupt the feature spaces in terms ofthe uniformity on the hypersphere [57]; the uniformity is animportant property of contrastive learning representation thatindicates the amount of input data information. Furthermore,post-pre-training with contrastive loss causes catastrophicforgetting of the general knowledge in pre-trained CLIP mod-els due to the overfitting by the restricted mini-batch sizes.To this end, we introduce a method for post-pre-trainingcalled CLIP-Refine (Figure 2), which is composed of randomfeature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation(HyCD). Instead of directly minimizing the gap betweenfeatures, our idea is to refine the image and text feature dis-tributions to follow a shared prior (e.g., standard Gaussian).To achieve this, RaFA minimizes the gap between the im-age/text feature vectors and the reference vectors, which arerandomly generated from the prior. In RaFA, the referencevectors are shared for the pairs of input image and text. Thus,RaFA penalizes image and text features to explicitly fol-low the same distribution. By matching the image and textfeature distributions, the features are expected to avoid exces-sive concentration and preserve uniformity among samples,resulting in a good balance of multi-modal alignment and uni-formity in the feature space. Conversely, HyCD is designedto avoid catastrophic forgetting by modified self-distillationloss with the supervision of image-text pairs. Specifically,we apply the knowledge distillation where the teacher is thepre-trained model, i.e., minimizing KL-divergence betweenthe outputs of the teacher and (student) post-pre-trainingmodel. Furthermore, we encourage learning new knowledgeby blending the teacher’s similarity matrix and the identitymatrix, which represents the supervision of matched image-text pairs. Combining RaFA and HyCD, the CLIP modelscan reduce the modality gap while maintaining the unifor-mity of features without forgetting past knowledge.Our extensive experiments on zero-shot classification(12 datasets) and cross-modal retrieval (2 datasets) demon-strate that our method significantly improves zero-shot per-formance over post-pre-training baselines with contrastiveloss. Through the quantitative and qualitative analysis offeature spaces, we found that CLIP-Refine not only reducesthe modality gap but also improves the uniformity of thehypersphere. This suggests that post-pre-training facilitateseffective cross-modal alignment and well-clustered features.2. Related WorkCLIP and Modality Gap. CLIP [23, 42] is a multi-modalrepresentation learning technique that trains a model to em-bed inputs from image and text modalities into shared fea-ture space. This is done by making the correct pairs ofimage and text closer in the feature space while the otherpairs in mini-batch repelled via the InfoNCE-based con-trastive loss [39]. While this simple multi-modal pre-traininghas remarkably advanced multi-modal research in variousfields [4, 5, 7, 54, 56, 58, 62], Liang et al. [30] have revealedthat pre-trained CLIP models encode image and text into dif-ferent clusters for each modality, i.e., modality gap, and thesmall temperature parameter in the CLIP’s contrastive losscan cause the modality gap empirically. The successor workby Qian et al. [41] has theoretically shown that contrastiveloss can not reduce the modality gap perfectly.Pre-training Modifications. To mitigate the modality gapand improve the cross-modal alignment, several works havemodified the contrastive loss of CLIP by adding auxiliarylosses, including geometric cyclic consistency between im-age and text features [15], the fine-grained similarity be-tween output tokens of both modalities [67], self-supervisedloss with data augmentation [28, 29], supervised contrastivelearning [65], textual augmented contrastive loss using LLM-generated positive/negative texts [10]. Another direction isto explicitly share the information of image and text modal-ities by introducing shared encoder weights [68] or sharedfeature spaces of finite discrete tokens [6] to the pre-training.These methods, however, require large-scale image-textpair datasets (e.g., CC12M [3] and LAION-400M [49]) toachieve practical performance, incurring high computationalcosts on multiple GPUs.

Intuition of CLIP-Refine (proposed method). CLIP-Refine modifies a pre-trained CLIP model by Random Feature Alignment(RaFA, left) and Hybrid Contrastive-Distillation (HyCD, right). RaFA penalizes image and text features to follow a shared prior distributionby minimizing the gap between the features and a random reference vector sampled from the prior. HyCD trains the model with theKL-divergence-based distillation loss using hybrid soft labels composed by alpha blending the ground truth label of image-text pairs withthe output of the pre-trained model (teacher).shelf pre-trained models by only using small datasets likeFlickr8/30K [44] and COCO Caption [31] with a single GPU.Besides, our method is cooperative with these pre-trainingmethods because it can be used for any pre-trained model.Fine-tuning Methods2. The original paper of CLIP [42] hasreported lower zero-shot performance in several fine-grainedclassification tasks, such as Aircraft [36], demonstrating theimperfectness of the cross-modal alignment of CLIP. Moti-vated by this, Zhou et al. [72, 73] have proposed to optimizetext prompts to mitigate the modality gap by updating ad-ditional trainable vectors while the pre-trained models arefixed. This simple approach helps match image and textin the feature space (i.e., reducing the modality gap) andsignificantly improves target performance. Similarly, Themethod of Jia et al. [24] learns the additional trainable pa-rameters for image input (visual prompt), and the successorworks [25, 51] have unified the visual and textual prompt tun-ing by the multi-task learning objectives. Another approachis to directly share the low-rank adaptation parameters acrossthe modalities and update them in fine-tuning [66]. In theperspective of the refinement of CLIP feature spaces, Ohet al. [38] have theoretically and empirically shown thatfine-tuned CLIP models retain the suboptimal feature spacein terms of alignment and uniformity, which are importantproperties to assess the feature quality in contrastive learn-ing [57]. To refine the feature space, they have provided amixup-based fine-tuning method, which generates hard neg-ative samples on the hypersphere in a cross-modal manner(m2-mix). These fine-tuning techniques succeed in reducingthe gap in target datasets, but they do not intend to improvethe zero-shot transfer performance. Our post-pre-trainingmethod differs from the fine-tuning methods in the objective:our method aims to improve the zero-shot transfer perfor-mance by reducing the modality gap. Obviously, we can2We refer to training models on specific target tasks as fine-tuning.Algorithm 1 CLIP-Refine for Post-pre-trainingRequire: Training dataset \protect \mathcal {D}, vision encoder f_\mathrm {V}, text encoder f_\mathrm {T},pre-trained parameters \ifmm ode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi \theta _\mathrm {V}^\mathrm {p}, \theta _\mathrm {T}^\mathrm {p}\}, training batchsize B, stepsize \eta , temperature parameter \tau , hyper-parameters \alpha Ensure: Post-pre-trained parameters \ifm mode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi \theta _\mathrm {V}, \theta _\mathrm {T}\}1: # Initialize parameters2: \t h eta _\mathrm {V}\leftarrow \theta _\mathrm {V}^\mathrm {p}3: \t h eta _\mathrm {T}\leftarrow \theta _\mathrm {T}^\mathrm {p}4: while not converged do5:\ifmm ode \lbr a ce \else \textbraceleft \fi (x^i,t^i)\}^B_{i=1}\sim \mathcal {D}6:\ifmmod e \lbrace \ else \t extb racele ft \fi z_\mathrm {img}^i, z_\mathrm {txt}^i\}^B_{i=1} \leftarrow \{f_\mathrm {V}(x^i;\theta _\mathrm {V}), f_\mathrm {T}(t^i;\theta _\mathrm {T})\}^B_{i=1}7:\ifmmode \lbrace \els e \textb racel eft \f i z_\mathrm {img}^{i,\mathrm {p}}, z_\mathrm {txt}^{i,\mathrm {p}}\}^B_{i=1} \leftarrow \{f_\mathrm {V}(x^i;\theta _\mathrm {V}^\mathrm {p}), f_\mathrm {T}(t^i;\theta _\mathrm {T}^\mathrm {p})\}^B_{i=1}8:# Compute random feature alignment loss9:\ifmmode \lb r ace \else \textbraceleft \fi z_\mathrm {ref}^i | z_\mathrm {ref}^i \sim p(z)\}^B_{i=1}10:\prot ect \math cal { L }_\mathr m {RaFA } \leftarrow \frac {1}{2B}\sum ^B_{i=1}\|z^i_\mathrm {img}-z^i_\mathrm {ref}\|^2_2 + \|z^i_\mathrm {txt}-z^i_\mathrm {ref}\|^2_2 11:# Compute hybrid contrastive-distillation loss12:Compute student outputs p^{\mathrm {I\to T}}_{i,j}and p^{\mathrm {T\to I}}_{i,j}for all samplecombinations in a batch by Eq.

We will release our dataset andthe enhanced guidelines that can be used totrain junior reviewers in the community.11IntroductionPeer Reviewing is widely regarded as one of themost effective ways to assess the quality of sci-entific papers (Ware and Mabe, 2009).It is adistributed procedure where the experts (review-ers) independently evaluate whether a submittedmanuscript adheres to the standards of the field.With the Mathew effect (Merton, 1968) in science(“rich get richer”), where the researchers receivebenefits throughout their career for having papersat prestigious venues, it is of utmost importance toensure sound practices in the reviewing process.1Code available here:https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-lazy-review[Although the proposed approach does bring WSD improvements, it is rather incremental. This is probably not a """"weakness"""" per se, just that the paper is not an eye-opener]. [The evaluation is done on German data only, which leaves some doubts about other languages.]Figure 1: Illustration of lazy thinking in ARR-22 re-views sourced from NLPEER (Dycke et al., 2023). Thefirst review segment belongs to the class ‘The results arenot novel.’ The last segment pertains to, ‘The approachis tested only on [not English], so unclear if it will gen-eralize to other languages.’ as per ARR-22 guidelines.With the growing load of paper submissions,reviewers often face an overwhelming work-load (Landhuis, 2016; Künzli et al., 2022) to assessmultiple manuscripts quickly. When presented witha cognitively hard task (e.g., reviewing) coupledwith information overload and limited time, hu-mans often end up using simple decision rules, alsoknown as heuristics (Tversky et al., 1974). Thoughsimple and efficient, these heuristics can often leadto errors and unfair evaluations (Raue and Scholl,2018). The usage of such heuristics to dismissresearch papers in the Natural Language Process-ing (NLP) Community has been termed as lazythinking (Rogers and Augenstein, 2021). One suchexample is shown in Fig 1. Here, the reviewer dis-misses the paper in the first review segment for notbeing an “eye-opener”. However, they do not pro-vide any references regarding similar prior work orfeedback to improve the paper. This corresponds tothe lazy thinking class ‘The results are not novel’.In 2021, when ACL Rolling Review (ARR) wasadopted as one of the main reviewing platformsfor major NLP conferences, these heuristics wereadded to the guidelines (Rogers and Augenstein,2021), aiming to discourage reviewers from rely-ing on such approaches.2 However, in their ACL2023 report, Rogers et al. (2023) identified the us-age of these heuristics as one of the leading factors(24.3%) of author-reported issues in peer reviews.2https://aclrollingreview.org/arXiv:2504.11042v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025Therefore, in this work, we focus on this pertinentissue, lazy thinking in NLP peer reviewing and heedKuznetsov et al. (2024)’s call for automated meth-ods to signal such occurrences in order to improvethe overall reviewing quality.To have a finer look at the problem of lazy think-ing in NLP peer reviews, we introduce LAZYRE-VIEW, a dataset with 500 expert-annotated reviewsegments and 1276 silver annotated review seg-ments from the best-performing model tagged withlazy thinking classes with a review segment con-sisting of 1 or more review sentences. We developthis dataset over three rounds of annotation and in-crementally sharpen the guidelines guided by inter-annotator agreements. We further provide positiveexamples, i.e., annotated examples for each class,to enhance the understanding of annotators for thistask and reach annotation consensus sooner. An-notating review segments by a new batch of an-notators who were not involved in developing theguidelines resulted in Cohen’s κ (Landis and Koch,1977) values of 0.32, 0.36, and 0.48, respectively.The steady increase in agreement across rounds jus-tifies the effectiveness of the developed guidelines.With this dataset, we further test the zero-shotcapabilities of LLMs in identifying lazy thinking,which can be leveraged downstream to identifyrule-following behaviour (Sun et al., 2024b) in peer-review scenarios. Despite likely exposure to peerreviews via platforms like OpenReview during pre-training, LLMs struggle to accurately identify thetype of lazy thinking when presented with the cur-rent guidelines. To enhance their comprehensionof lazy thinking, we employ instruction-tuning onthe LLMs using our dataset, leading to significantperformance gains—around 10-20 accuracy pointscompared to their zero-shot and few-shot perfor-mances. Finally, we perform a controlled experi-ment where human reviewers rewrite peer reviewswith(out) using annotations of lazy thinking fromour dataset. Human preference-based evaluationsreveal that reviews written with the lazy thinkingguidance are more comprehensive and actionablethan their vanilla counterparts.Contributions. We make the following contribu-tions: (1) Introduce LAZYREVIEW, a dataset an-notated with lazy thinking classes for a new taskin model development and evaluation.(2) En-hance annotation guidelines to improve both au-tomated and human annotations. (3) Demonstratethat positive examples boost annotation quality andin-context learning. (4) Show that instruction tun-ing on our dataset enhances model performance.(5) Find that annotated lazy thinking classes im-prove review quality.2LAZYREVIEW: A Dataset for detectingLazy Thinking in Peer ReviewsIn line with Rogers and Augenstein (2021), we firstdefine lazy thinking as follows.Definition. ‘Lazy thinking, in the context of NLPresearch paper reviews, refers to the practice ofdismissing or criticizing research papers basedon superficial heuristics or preconceived notionsrather than thorough analysis. It is characterizedby reviewers raising concerns that lack substantialsupporting evidence and are often influenced byprevailing trends within the NLP community.’Rogers and Augenstein (2021) enlist a total of 14types of lazy thinking heuristics in the ARR 2021guidelines adapted from the study in Rogers andAugenstein (2020). We show some of the classesas described in the guidelines in Table 1.3 Re-iterating the example in Fig 1, we note that suchclaims about novelty need to be backed up withsupporting evidence and hence constitute a classicexample of lazy thinking as per the guidelines.In this section, we describe the creation ofour dataset, LAZYREVIEW guided by the ARR2022 (Rogers and Augenstein, 2021) and theEMNLP 2020 guidelines (Liu et al., 2020). Wedescribe the dataset curation process followed byan analysis of the dataset. This is the first dataset ofannotated instances with fine-grained lazy thinkingclasses for NLP peer reviews.2.1Review Collection and SamplingWe use the ARR 2022 reviews from the NLPEERDataset (Dycke et al., 2023) in which the reviewsare collected using the 3Y-pipeline (Dycke et al.,2022) and as such has clear licenses attached.The dataset comprises reviews from five venues:CONLL 2016, ACL 2017, COLING 2020, ARR2022, and F1000RD (an open-source science jour-nal), with 11K review reports sourced from 5Kpapers. Focusing on the lazy thinking definition inthe ARR 2022 guidelines (Rogers and Augenstein,2021), we consider only the ARR-22 reviews, using684 reviews from 476 papers with 11,245 sentencesin total. Each review is divided into sections like‘paper summary’, ‘summary of strengths’, ‘sum-mary of weaknesses’, and ‘comments, typos, and3The full table is provided in Table 7 in Appendix §A.1HeuristicsDescriptionExample review segmentsThe results are not surprisingMany findings seem obvious in ret-rospect, but this does not mean thatthe community is already aware ofthem and can use them as buildingblocks for future work.Transfer learning does not lookto bring significant improvements.Looking at the variance, the resultswith and without transfer learningoverlap. This is not surprising.The results are not novelSuch broad claims need to bebacked up with references.The approach the authors proposeis still useful but not very novel.The paper has language errorsAs long as the writing is clearenough, better scientific contentshould be more valuable than betterjournalistic skills.The paper would be easy to fol-low with English proofreading eventhough the overall idea is under-standable.Table 1: Descriptions for some of the lazy thinking classes sourced from ARR 2022 guidelines (Rogers andAugenstein, 2021). We present some examples corresponding to these classes from our dataset, LAZYREVIEW.suggestions’, with reviewers completing the rele-vant sections based on their evaluation. However,there is no standardized format for expressing con-cerns, so we use automated methods to extract rele-vant review segments, as detailed later.2.2Review FormattingWe utilize GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024) to preparethe instances (review segments) for subsequent an-notations. We instruct GPT-4 to extract the reviewsegments from the ‘Summary of Weaknesses’ sec-tion of the review that can be classified into one ofthe lazy thinking classes, as outlined in the ARRguidelines4. Since lazy thinking often contributesto reasons for rejecting a paper, we believe it willappear only in the ‘Summary of Weaknesses’ sec-tion. We obtain 1,776 review segments after thisstep, with each segment having varied lengths from1 to 5 review sentences, as described later in Sec 2.5.To validate the quality of the extracted segments,we sample a set of 100 segments from this pooland task three annotators to independently annotateeach segment within the context of the entire reviewto decide on their candidacy towards lazy thinking.The final label is chosen based on a majority vote.We obtain Cohen’s κ of 0.82 and obtain precision,recall and F1 scores as 0.74, 1.00 and 0.85, respec-tively. Intuitively, this means that GPT-4 samplesmore candidates than required, giving us a largerpool of candidates for annotation. We thereforeintroduce another class to our labelling schema,‘None’ to annotate non-lazy thinking candidates.2.3Annotation ProtocolAnnotators are given the full review and the targetreview segment (highlighted) to classify accordingto incrementally developed lazy thinking guide-lines based on ARR 2022. They also indicate their4The prompt for GPT-4 is provided in Appendix §A.4confidence levels: low, medium, or high. To aid inunderstanding, we added two additional classes:‘None’ for no lazy thinking, and ‘Not EnoughInformation’ for instances lacking specificity orneeding the paper for proper classification.Two Ph.D. students, both fluent in English andexperienced in NLP peer reviewing, are taskedwith annotating review segments iteratively, giventhat peer reviewing requires specialized expertise.A senior PostDoc with an NLP background actsas a third annotator to resolve any disagreementsbetween the initial annotations. The guidelinesevolve over multiple rounds. Once the guidelinesare refined and finalized, we recruit a new batchof annotators to re-validate them by asking themto annotate the same review segments. These newannotators follow the same set of guidelines used inthe earlier rounds to ensure consistency. After thisvalidation process, the original Ph.D. annotatorsare retained to annotate additional instances.2.4Evolving GuidelinesWe incrementally improve the guidelines guidedby the inter-annotator agreements. Given the highsubjectivity of this domain, we consider the guide-lines to be precise once we achieve a substantialagreement on annotating the instances further.Round 1: ARR 2022 Guidelines. In this round,the annotators are provided with the existingARR (Rogers and Augenstein, 2021) guidelinesand asked to annotate the lazy thinking classes. Wesample a set of 50 instances from the review seg-ments extracted by GPT-4 as described in Sec §2.1.After the first round of annotation, we obtain aCohen’s kappa, κ of 0.31. This is a substantiallylow agreement, revealing an ambiguity in the re-viewing guidelines. The confusion matrix for thefirst round of annotation is shown in Fig 16a (cf.§A.9). We find that there is a high agreement forthe ‘None’ class, which implies that the annotatorscan easily detect a review segment that is not prob-lematic. However, they struggle to determine thefine-grained label of the problematic review seg-ments. Further analysis of the confidence level ofthe annotators reveals that for most of the cases,the annotators have low confidence, as shown inFig 17a (cf. §A.9), which points towards ambiguityin the guidelines.Round 2: ARR 2022 and EMNLP guidelines.We further explored the initial reviewing guidelinesreleased during EMNLP 2020 (Liu et al., 2020).We identify some additional classes that arenow missing from the ARR guidelines, namely‘Non-mainstream Approaches’ (rejecting papersfor not using current trending approaches) and‘Resource Paper’ (favoring resource papers lesserfor ACL conferences). Additionally, we extenddescriptions of some of the classes such as, ‘Thishas no precedent in existing literature’, ‘Themethod is too simple’ using the guidelines in Liuet al. (2020). Moreover, we extend the name ofsome of the class labels based on the EMNLP2020 guidelines, such as ‘The paper has languageerrors’ with ‘Writing Style’; ‘The topic is tooniche’ with ‘Narrow topics’, which have similarmeanings. We show the extended descriptions forthose classes in Table 8 (cf. Appendix §A.1). Weannotate the same set of instances as in Round 1and eventually calculate agreements. We obtainCohen’s κ of 0.38, which is significantly higherthan the previous round (0.31).We observehigher agreements for the classes having extendednames such as, ‘The paper has language errors’and ‘Niche Topics’, as illustrated in Fig 16b (cf.§A.9). The confidence level of the annotators alsosubstantially increased from low to medium in thisround, as can be seen in Fig 17b (cf. §A.9).Round 3: Round 2 guidelines with positive exam-ples. To promote quick learning through “workedexamples"" (Atkinson et al., 2000), we refine ourannotation round by fixing the guidelines and incor-porating positive examples for each lazy thinkingclass. We evaluated several techniques to selectrepresentative examples, measuring effectivenessusing Cohen’s κ. The methods include (a) Random:selecting the shortest or longest review segments,and (b) Diversity: encoding segments with SciB-ERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), clustering them usingK-Means, and choosing the cluster center with thelowest cosine distance.

Its ability to analyze largeamounts of data and make predictions has led to remarkable advances in fields suchas healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, as machine learning al-gorithms increasingly shape decision-making processes, concerns about fairness andethical implications have garnered significant attention. The quest for fairness in ma-chine learning, guided by the principles of AI ethics, has become a crucial endeavorto ensure equitable outcomes, address biases, and uphold societal values.The motivation for using fairness-aware ML in software engineering is two-fold.First, as ML algorithms become more prevalent in our society, it is critical to ensurethat they are not perpetuating and reinforcing existing societal biases and discrimina-tion. For example, if an algorithm is trained on historical data that are biased againstcertain groups, it may make discriminative decisions against those groups. This canlead to unfair treatment of individuals and perpetuate existing social inequalities. Byincorporating fairness considerations into the design and implementation of ML al-gorithms, we can reduce the risk of bias and discrimination. Second, there is also alegal and ethical imperative to maintain a fair use of ML techniques. Discriminationon the basis of protected characteristics (race, gender, etc.) is prohibited by law inmany countries, and failure to take steps to prevent discrimination can result in legaland reputational consequences.Many empirical studies in software engineering show that mitigating fairnessbugs is associated with a trade-off between fairness and performance: To obtainfairer outcomes from a machine learning model, one must compromise the predic-tive power (accuracy, etc.) of the model. However, in more recent studies, researchershave reported encouraging progress that such trade-offs can be optimized [26, 37, 56].Fig. 1: Pareto frontier in the Adultdataset with protected attribute race.That is to say, nowadays more researchis conducted aiming to ensure fairnesswith the least harm to model perfor-mance. Among various approaches, En-semble learning is one of the most ex-plored techniques. State-of-the-art (SOTA)approaches, such as Fair-SMOTE [21] andMAAT [22], use different forms of ensem-ble learning to achieve an ideal trade-offbalance between performance and fairness.However, we discover that little effort wasinvested in prior work to conduct a com-prehensive assessment of the trade-off goalsspace. In other words, in this paper, we askthe following question:1. Can we program ""awareness of fair-ness"" as a hyperparameter configura-tion within the ML model?Software Engineering Principles for Fairer Systems: Experiments with GroupCART32. Can we optimize such fairness-awareconfigurations as a multi-objective optimization task where there exist trade-offs between predictive performance and fairness?3. If one can obtain different optimum trade-offs (with different model configurations),could we aggregate these potential solu-tions via ensemble learning?Previous work such as MAAT [22] failed to answer those questions as their ap-proach only explored the ensemble learning of size two: one model for fairnessand one model for accuracy. We wonder if more than two models can obtain bet-ter performance-fairness trade-offs. Moreover, if users of ML software would like touse different fairness or performance metrics as their key measurements, we wouldlike to make our algorithm customizable to different metrics, as well as to differentimportance ratios between fairness metric scores and performance scores.Preliminary results in this paper demonstrate that, by training candidate mod-els with different configuration parameters, one can obtain more than one “optimaltrade-off"" solution. As shown in Figure 1, the x-axis represents disparate impact (DI)scores, and the y-axis the F1 scores. In both axes, greater values are better. Non-dominated points are calculated according to the definition of binary domination asdescribed later in Eq. 1. The star at the top-right corner represents the “heaven"" whereboth fairness and performance reach optimum. We initialized 20 decision tree mod-els, each with a distinct importance weight ratio between performance and fairness.Based on the definition of binary domination, there exist 5 non-dominated (so-calledPareto optimal) models. More importantly, this leads to a crucial question: Since the5 models are all considered “optimal” solutions in the performance-fairness trade-off,which model(s) should we choose to generate final prediction outcomes? A similarphenomenon is observed in the study by Cruz et al. [26]. In their recent study, thefairness-performance Pareto frontiers were obtained from training 10K different hy-Fig. 2: Presented in the paper be Cruz et al. [26], the Pareto frontier of the fairness-performance trade-off in three datasets. Each dot represents a hyper-parameter con-figuration setting applied on one of the five ML algorithms selected by Cruz et al..4Kewen Peng et al.perparameter configurations of 5 ML algorithms. As shown in Figure 2, most of theconfigurations are, in fact, suboptimal solutions in the fairness-performance multi-objective competition. In this paper, we found that we can endorse the observationmade by Cruz et al. in many other empirical datasets. More importantly, our pro-posed approach can reduce the size of the configuration pool from thousands to tensof candidates, as we directly configure the awareness of fairness via fairness-awaredecision tree algorithms (later elaborated in §4.1).In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning framework that (a) trains decisiontrees that simultaneously optimize for both fairness and predictive performance, (b)identifies distinct optimal solutions as candidate trees, and (c) averages the predic-tions of the candidate trees to make the final predictions. As shown by the experi-mental results, GroupCART has achieved the following contributions:– GroupCART provides on-par or better predictive performance than benchmarkmethods.– GroupCART provides adjustable tuning options for trade-offs between perfor-mance and fairness.– GroupCART is applicable to multiple protected attributes and can provide smoothtuning options.– The implementation of GroupCART is publicly available and potentially applica-ble to any tree-based ensemble learning algorithm (e.g. Random Forest, AdaBoostdecision tree).2 Background2.1 Why SE Should Care About FairnessThe rapid development of ML has greatly benefited SE practitioners, and examplesof ML-assisted software can be found everywhere: defect prediction models used tolocate the most error-prone code files in the upcoming releases; effort estimation toolsused to better manage human and capital resources; multi-objective optimizers usedto generate configuration solutions for systems of enormous configurable options.Meanwhile, ethical concerns have also drawn increasing attention in the ML and SEcommunities.While in many scenarios, the only utility needed to be optimized is the perfor-mance of the models (in tasks about prediction, classification, ranking, etc.), othercases where private information of human beings is collected need to be handledmore carefully. ML software systems have been deployed in many areas to assist inmaking decisions that affect human individuals: courts and corrections departmentsin the US use software to determine sentence length for defendants [29]; algorithmsare used to predict default payments from credit card users [60]. During such proce-dures, private information, such as age, ethnicity, and gender, is collected. Moreover,previous studies reported that models learned from such data may contain algorithmicbias toward certain social groups.In response to the above-mentioned issues, IEEE has provoked ethical designs ofAI-assisted systems [54] and the European Union also announced the ethics guide-Software Engineering Principles for Fairer Systems: Experiments with GroupCART5lines for building trustworthy AI [25]. Fairness has been emphasized in both docu-ments. Big industrial companies such as Facebook [7], Microsoft [8], and Google [55]have also begun to invest effort in ensuring the fairness of their products. In academia,IEEE and ACM have set specific tracks [9, 10] for papers studying fairness problems.2.2 Related Work: Fairness in SEDespite everything mentioned above, sometimes we get questions about the relevanceand applicability of this work to SE. For example: “Given a paper proposing methodsto fix fairness bugs in ML-assisted software, should one submit this paper instead toa machine learning venue?”. Here, we demonstrate the relevance of ML fairness inthe SE field from the following perspectives.– Software Configuration: Recent research has increasingly approached fairnessin ML as a problem of software configuration [21, 26, 48, 50, 51], offering com-pelling evidence that fairness can be integrated into the software developmentlife cycle through systematic interventions. One significant study [19] argues forthe routine inclusion of bias testing and mitigation within the ML software de-velopment process, demonstrating that these practices can enhance fairness with-out significantly compromising model performance. Complementing this, anotherstudy [22] introduces a novel ensemble approach, MAAT, which addresses bothfairness and performance bugs, highlighting the potential of ensembles in thisdomain. Further work [31] on ensemble methods explores how fairness can beinherently improved by carefully designing the ensemble architecture without re-lying on traditional mitigation techniques, suggesting that fairness compositioncan be managed as part of software configuration based on data characteristics.– Feature Engineering and Debugging: Other approaches focus on more gran-ular aspects of the software development process, such as feature engineeringand debugging, to enhance fairness. For example, enlarging the feature set [62]can strike a balance between fairness and accuracy, as highlighted in researchthat emphasizes the importance of richer feature sets for achieving this sweetspot. Moreover, many researchers emphasize the importance of treating fairnessissues similarly to software bugs. A novel debugging method [43] referred toas Linear-regression based Training Data Debugging (LTDD), inspired by tra-ditional software debugging practices, is proposed to identify and exclude bi-ased feature components in training data, thereby improving fairness. Similarly,an automatic repair approach [37] leverages multi-objective search techniquesto enhance both fairness and accuracy in ML-based decision-making software,reinforcing the idea that fairness can be optimized through software configura-tion. Additionally, studies on counterfactual predictions, such as MirrorFair [59],showcase how fairness bugs can be mitigated by training models on both origi-nal and counterfactual datasets, further underscoring the potential of systematicconfigurations in achieving fairer ML outcomes. These works collectively sug-gest that fairness in ML can be effectively managed through targeted softwareconfiguration strategies, paving the way for more equitable and reliable softwaresystems.6Kewen Peng et al.– Fairness Testing: Fairness testing is another critical area where SE practices canbe adapted to address bias in ML systems. Traditional testing methods have beenexpanded to include fairness as a key criterion, ensuring that models are evaluatednot only for performance but also for equity. For example, adversarial samplingtechniques have been developed to rigorously test ML models for fairness [63],helping to identify and mitigate potential biases before deployment. Besides ex-plorations in specific techniques, a comprehensive survey [24] of 100 fairnesstesting papers has further highlighted the importance of this practice within SE,demonstrating how systematic testing can prevent the propagation of biases inML-assisted software. It compiles a summary of public datasets and open-sourcetools for fairness testing, providing a navigation for researchers and practitionersinterested in the field. These contributions emphasize the proactive role of fair-ness testing in the software development process, making it an integral part ofcreating unbiased software systems.– Empirical Studies: Despite the existing body of work in the field, the persis-tent challenge of balancing fairness and performance in machine learning modelsunderscores the complexity of treating fairness as a software engineering prob-lem. As mentioned earlier, it’s commonly believed in the research communitythat bias mitigation techniques tend to enhance fairness, but often at the expenseof machine learning performance (such as accuracy), a concept referred to as the""fairness-performance trade-off."" [22, 57] A comprehensive empirical study [23]investigating 17 bias mitigation methods across various machine learning clas-sifiers reveals the intricate trade-offs involved in this process. The study high-lights that the effectiveness of these methods is highly context-dependent, varyingacross tasks, models, and the choice of protected attributes. No single bias mit-igation method consistently achieves the optimal trade-off between fairness andperformance across all scenarios, emphasizing the need for software engineersto carefully select and configure these methods based on specific application re-quirements. This evidence reinforces the notion that fairness must be treated as aconfigurable software property, requiring thoughtful integration into the softwaredevelopment life cycle.3 Problem DescriptionIn this section, we introduce (a) fundamental concepts of software fairness and (b)related work that tries to ensure it.3.1 Fairness in ML SoftwareIn this work, we use binary classification models. We define some terms specific tothe fairness of binary classification.– A favorable label in a binary classification task is the label that grants the instance(usually human individuals) with privilege such as a job offer or being acceptedfor a loan.Software Engineering Principles for Fairer Systems: Experiments with GroupC","Context: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate classifications with cer-tain fairness constraints. Traditional machine learning software based on decision tree learners takes intoaccount only the information gain change in the target attribute. Although effective, such learners generatemodels that inappropriately discriminate against specific protected social groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity,etc.). Motivated by such results, more recent studies have proposed bias mitigation methods.Objective: Rather than repair the bias once after it has been added to a model, we take another ap-proach, and we avoid bias during model generation. Specifically, during decision tree construction, wemake choices that better navigate the fairness-performance trade-off.Method: Here, we propose GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer that is designed not only"

Af-fordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structurealignment module that exploits structural consistency priorsto align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, result-ing in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat datasetsignificantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGSdomain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms ex-isting methods across both seen and unseen settings, high-lighting its robust generalization capabilities.1. Introduction3D affordance reasoning represents a fundamental capabil-ity for embodied agents to understand how to interact withobjects in their environment [14, 34, 50]. By identifyingfunctional regions of 3D objects that allow specific actions(e.g., parts that can be grasped, pulled, or rotated), robotscan perform precise manipulations based on human instruc-tions [2, 6, 19, 33, 42, 52, 55, 57, 59, 72]. This capabil-ity bridges the gap between perception and action, enablingmore natural human-robot collaboration in various appli-cations ranging from household assistance to industrial au-tomation.Existing methods for affordance reasoning primarily relyon image, video, and point cloud representations [1, 30, 31,40, 51]. However, each of these approaches presents no-table limitations. Image-based methods depend solely on2D projections, which lack depth information and fail tocapture the complete 3D structure of objects [28, 62]. Whilevideos provide dynamic visual cues, they do not offer direct3D spatial information and are challenging to annotate [1].Additionally, videos often struggle to represent subtle dy-namic changes during human-object interactions.Pointcloud data, although providing direct 3D geometric repre-sentation, are inherently discrete [13, 20, 30, 37, 63, 65].As shown in Figure 2, their sparsity and limited geometricresolution fundamentally constrain their ability to representdetailed and continuous affordance structures. This criticallimitation arises from their discrete sampling nature, whichfails to capture continuous surfaces and intricate geometricfeatures essential for precise reasoning by AI agents.Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [23]offer promising solutions, enabling high-fidelity scene re-construction and real-time rendering through Gaussianprimitives that inherently encode rich 3D geometric andphotometric attributes. 3DGS represents 3D scenes as a col-lection of 3D Gaussians with learnable parameters, offer-ing several advantages over traditional 3D Affordance ap-proach: 1) higher geometric precision and the preservationof surface details, addressing the issues of discreteness andincompleteness in point cloud data, 2) integration of richcolor information, compensating for the lack of 3D spatialinformation in image-based methods, 3) efficient real-timerendering with low computational requirements, achievinghigh frame rates (30+ fps at 1080p resolution) and overcom-ing the limitations of video-based methods in dynamic in-formation capture and resource efficiency. These propertiesmake 3DGS particularly suitable for affordance reasoningin embodied intelligence applications where real-time per-formance and resource efficiency are critical.Despite the advantages of 3DGS, its application in af-fordance reasoning is hindered by three significant chal-lenges.The lack of large-scale 3DGS datasets with af-fordance annotations limits model training and evaluation,while existing models, designed for discrete data like pointclouds or images, fail to leverage 3DGS’s unique continu-ous properties, reducing potential gains in accuracy and ef-ficiency. Additionally, aligning 3DGS with abundant pointcloud affordance data is complex due to the mismatch be-tween point clouds’ sparse, noisy nature and 3DGS’s de-tailed, continuous representation, requiring elaborated tech-niques to ensure geometric and semantic consistency. Moreimportantly, conventional semantic embedding methods for3DGS suffer from fundamental limitations [3, 7, 19]. Para-metric expansion techniques that statically assign a sin-gle semantic feature to each Gaussian primitive are inad-equate for representing multi-attribute affordance scenar-ios, in which individual Gaussian may simultaneously con-2tribute to diverse functional contexts. This constraint onsingle semantics reduces real-world applicability, as objectsoften require context-aware interpretations across multipleaffordance dimensions.To address these challenges, we first introduce 3DAf-fordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal 3DGS-basedAffordance Reasoning dataset with comprehensive affor-dance annotations. As shown in Figure 1, 3DAffordSplatencompasses three modalities: 3D Gaussian, point cloud,and textual instruction, all aligned with consistent affor-dance annotations. This dataset supports effective cross-modal learning and facilitates knowledge transfer acrossvarious representations. Furthermore, 3DAffordSplat com-prises a diverse array of objects and scenes, providing a ro-bust foundation for developing and evaluating affordancereasoning models.Building on this dataset, we establish the first compre-hensive evaluation framework for 3DGS-based affordancereasoning.Our benchmark employs established metricsfrom prior affordance analysis research [30, 63] - includingmIoU, AUC, SIM and MAE - to enable cross-modal per-formance comparison while maintaining backward compat-ibility with existing point cloud benchmarks. This frame-work facilitates fair comparisons between different methodsand provides a new direction for advancing research in thisdomain.Additionally, we propose a novel 3DGS-based affor-dance reasoning model, AffordSplatNet, the first gener-alizable 3DGS architecture for affordance reasoning thatestablishes cross-modal structural correspondence betweensparse point clouds and dense Gaussian representations.Our model incorporates a cross-modal structure alignmentmodule that utilizes structural consistency priors to align3D point cloud and 3DGS representations. This effectivealignment and knowledge transfer between complementaryrepresentations not only enhances affordance reasoning pre-cision but also improves the robustness to geometric varia-tions and partial observations. Our contributions are sum-marized as follows.• We introduce 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal 3DGS-based Affordance Reasoning with com-prehensive affordance annotations, comprising Gaussian,point cloud, and textual instruction modalities.• We propose a novel 3DGS-based affordance reasoningmodel, AffordSplatNet, that enables effective knowledgetransfer between point cloud and Gaussian representa-tions, improving affordance reasoning accuracy and ro-bustness.• Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DAffordSplateffectively enhances existing point cloud methods for3DGS affordance reasoning. Additionally, our Afford-SplatNet outperforms existing methods in both seen andunseen settings, validating its generalization ability.2. Related Work2.1. Affordance LearningInitial efforts in affordance learning first concentrated on2D domain.Early methods [11] mainly focused on lo-cating interaction regions in images and videos and thengrouding [1, 27, 39, 69] the affordance. These works re-lied mainly on precise annotations and convolutional neu-ral networks (CNNs). To address the limitation of seman-tics and dynamic granularity, some researchers [18, 28] in-corporated language with 2D images. Latest 2D work fo-cused on limited sample [28], the combination of large lan-guage models (LLMs) [44] and embodied learning [15, 72],to cut down the cost and embracing the real world. How-ever, 2D domain leads to some fatal problem.On onehand, there is a limitation on complex 3D interactions withmulti-orientation and multi-object. On the other hand, 2Dspace also lacks the ability to capture the spatial complex-ity of real-world environments, especially when occlusionappears.With the increasing availability of 3D data, research hasprogressively shifted toward understanding the 3D world.3D AffordanceNet [10] introduced the first benchmarkdataset for learning affordances from object point cloudsand proposed an end-to-end grounding architecture. Sub-sequent works [8, 30, 65] continued to explore the integra-tion of point clouds with language queries, some leveragingLLMs. However, affordance learning in embodied AI re-quires strong generalization capabilities, which current 3Dmodels often fail to achieve.To address this limitation,several studies [9, 13, 37, 47, 51] have employed 2D af-fordance learning to enhance 3D affordance understanding.This approach has been successfully applied to embodiedtasks such as grasping and navigation [54, 57, 67]. While3D point clouds provide valuable geometric information foraffordance analysis, they suffer from several limitations. Asillustrated in Figure 2, the sparsity of point clouds often re-sults in poor representation of continuous surfaces and com-plex structures, leading to noticeable discrepancies com-pared to real-world objects. Although increasing point den-sity can improve geometric fidelity, it significantly raisescomputational costs. In contrast, 3D Gaussians representa-tions not only preserve high-fidelity geometry but also en-able efficient rendering, making them a more practical so-lution for affordance learning.As shown inTable 1,existing 3D affordancedatasets are primarily based on the point cloud modality.3DAffordanceNet[10] was the first large-scale benchmarkfor 3D point cloud affordance learning. Datasets such asLASO[30] and SeqAfford[65] incorporate language modal-ities, with LASO focusing on single-question affordanceanswering and SeqAfford extending this to multi-questionformats.

Influence Maxi-mization (IM) (Li et al. 2023) aims to expand network scaleswithin a given diffusion model. IM finds diverse applica-tions, from interrupting the spread of COVID-19 (Cheng,Kuo, and Zhou 2020) to enhancing viral marketing strate-gies (Castiglione et al. 2020) and facilitating rumor con-trol (Vega-Oliveros, da Fontoura Costa, and Rodrigues2020). At its core, IM identifies active members, or “seeds”,with robust propagation capabilities, initiating the diffusionprocess within the network. Strategically pinpointing andleveraging these influential nodes enables maximal impactwithin the network, serving various societal and strategic ob-jectives.*This work was completed during an internship at NetEase.†Corresponding author.Copyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of ArtificialIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.When applied to temporal graphs (Yanchenko, Murata,and Holme 2023), IM maintains its primary objective whileaccounting for the chronological order of edge establish-ment, introducing complexity due to evolving connectionsover time. IM is known for its NP-hard nature, and thegreedy algorithm is a traditional method for approximat-ing the optimal solution (Yanchenko, Murata, and Holme2023). In contrast, SPEX (Li et al. 2021) motivates us asupervised pipeline aimed at expanding the network scale,which is the ultimate goal of IM. This approach explicitlydefines active members, thereby bypassing the need to ad-dress the NP-hard problem directly. To be specific, we adoptInfluence Propagation Path (IPP) from SPEX, wherein theinitial node forms social connections with multi-hop friendsover consecutive timestamps. In the context of the IM prob-lem, the initial node of any IPP inherently qualifies as an“active member”. In this supervised context, accurately pre-dicting these labeled active members becomes crucial fornetwork expansion. Thus, the challenges of efficiently la-beling IPPs and accurately predicting active members (Γ1)emerge as central considerations. In addition, the IM prob-lem faces the often-overlooked cold-start issue, character-ized by sparse social information at the outset, leading toperformance declines for initial nodes. During the diffusionprocess, the initial network scale is smaller than the finalscale, indicating the presence of cold-start nodes. This issuerecurs across timestamps in temporal graphs, adds complex-ity. Essentially, the IM problem in temporal graphs is signifi-cantly affected by a severe and persistent cold-start problem(Γ2). Despite extensive exploration in social recommenda-tion (Panda and Ray 2022), the cold-start issue has receivedlimited attention in the context of IM.In this study, we tackle the above two challenges (Γ1 andΓ2) with the following solutions. First, to address the firstchallenge (Γ1), we introduce Motif-Based Filtering (MF),streamlining the identification of all IPPs by using knowninitiators as ground truth. Additionally, we implement a Uni-fied Temporal Graph Network (TGN), specifically tailoredfor multi-relational temporal graphs. This TGN incorporatesedge establishment, conversion, and diminishing, ensuringaccurate predictions of active members. By transforming op-arXiv:2504.11245v1 [cs.SI] 15 Apr 2025erations into equivalent tensor operations, our TGN imple-mentation significantly enhances efficiency and scales effec-tively with larger datasets. Second, to address the cold-startproblem (Γ2), we efficiently augment cold-start nodes byadding new neighbors from historical timestamps that sharesimilar IPPs. To expedite the matching of similar IPPs, weencode IPPs as strings and construct a prefix tree based onthese strings.In our experimental design, we conducted an empiri-cal study through A/B testing within an online team-basedgame, utilizing our IM solution to enhance the game’s na-tive social recommendation system’s coverage. The game’stemporal multi-relational graphs, formed by edge times-tamps and strong and weak relationships, perfectly alignwith our desired scenario. Augmenting the game’s networkscale emerges as a pivotal factor in boosting the impact of itsbuilt-in social recommendations. We selected this game dueto its robust socialization features, which facilitated compre-hensive data collection and empirical study. The offline ex-periment systematically highlighted the prediction accuracyof our approach, while the online experiment evaluated real-world network scale growth. Results from both experimentsconsistently affirm our method’s superior performance. Inthe online experiment, our method demonstrates a 3.52%overall improvement and a 14.32% improvement in cold-start scenarios for spreading, compared to all other evaluatedmethods. In summary, our contributions are as follows:• Efficient Labeling Methods: We focus on a subset ofactive members and introduce efficient labeling methodsto enhance IM adaptability. Additionally, our implemen-tation achieves up to a 22-fold speedup in TGN trainingunder our experimental settings, providing a practical al-ternative to current high-performance GNN frameworks.• Addressing the Cold-Start Issue: We propose a methodto efficiently provide neighborhood information for cold-start nodes, effectively tackling this issue in IM.• Practical Application and Validation: We apply our ap-proach to a specific practical problem, demonstrating itseffectiveness in expanding network scale through A/Btesting in an online experiment.Related WorkInfluence Maximization (IM) and Temporal GraphIM involves a diffusion model delineating the diffusion pro-cess and an algorithm tailored to identify active members.The diffusion simulation typically relies on models like theIndependent Cascade (IC) or Linear Threshold (LT) (Li et al.2023). These models estimate the probability of diffusionbased on data from the downstream domain, simulating thenetwork’s post-diffusion state. Greedy algorithms are com-monly employed to seek suboptimal solution for this NP-hard problem (Feng et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). Ourfocus lies on addressing the IM problem within temporalgraphs, particularly exploring supervised solutions. IM intemporal graphs accounts for temporal variations by consid-ering both the formation and disappearance of edges. Conse-quently, it grapples with challenges posed by NP-hard com-plexities and graph dynamics. Recent surveys (Yanchenko,Murata, and Holme 2023) include various traditional solu-tions, approximation algorithms (Erkol, Mazzilli, and Radic-chi 2020), and heuristic node ranking methods (Michalski,Jankowski, and Pazura 2020), which diverge from our pro-posed solutions.Deep Learning (DL) for IMDL solutions for IM have gained prominence due to theireffectiveness in handling large-scale networks. In staticgraphs, Wang et al. (Wang et al. 2021) conducted em-pirical studies employing graph embedding via unsuper-vised learning. They initially employed struc2vec (Ribeiro,Saverese, and Figueiredo 2017) to generate node embed-dings with structural semantics, followed by clustering tech-niques to identify active members. For temporal graphs,recent approaches in dynamic IM (i.e., IM on temporalgraph), as discussed in a survey (Li et al. 2023), draw in-spiration from either the reinforcement learning (RL) frame-work (Meirom et al. 2021; Mendonc¸a, Barreto, and Ziviani2020) or from updating embeddings based on graph dynam-ics (Peng 2021). In supervised learning, methods either uti-lize proxies for active members (Qiu et al. 2018) or generatelabels based on diffusion models (Kumar et al. 2022; Kumar,Mallik, and Panda 2023) before applying an improved pre-diction model. Our supervised learning approach builds onexisting research for label generation but introduces a novelelement by incorporating multi-relational temporal graphs.Research GapThis study addresses several research gaps within the do-main of IM on temporal graphs. Notably, there has been lim-ited exploration of supervised learning methods in this area.Our approach adheres to the traditional IM framework butintroduces a novel labeling technique based on motif iden-tification, effectively addressing our first set of challenges.Moreover, the cold-start issue has received little recent atten-tion in the IM domain (Panda and Ray 2022). Existing so-lutions (Ojagh, Malek, and Saeedi 2020; Herce-Zelaya et al.2020; Bedi et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) often rely on sup-plementary information beyond the primary data. Temporal-aware approaches (Wei et al. 2017; Zhang and Liu 2015;Chalyi, Leshchynskyi, and Leshchynska 2019) primarily fo-cus on user-item scenarios. In contrast, our solution inno-vatively acquires neighbors from observed timestamps, uti-lizing solely the inherent temporal social networks. Conse-quently, this cold-start solution for the IM problem addressesour second set of challenges.Preliminary and BackgroundIn real-world scenarios, social relationships among peoplechange dynamically over time. At a given timestamp t, asocial network is represented as Gt = (Vt, Et), where Vtdenotes the individuals (nodes) and Et denotes their rela-tionships (edges). For any edge eti,j ∈Et, it connects nodesvti and vtj within Vt. If we consider one week as a timeunit, a temporal graph includes all nodes and edges that oc-cur within that week. The neighbors of a node vti at times-tamp t are defined as N ti = S∀eti,j vj, which includes allnodes connected to vi at timestamp t. Furthermore, we de-fine N t(V ) = Svi∈V N ti to facilitate subsequent discus-sions.Diffusion and Influence Maximization. In a social net-work, diffusion refers to a recursive propagation processfrom a node to its neighbors, forming a rapidly expandingdiffusion network. Over timestamps from 0 to T −1, the net-work scale is defined as σ(S, T −1) = | ST −1t=0 Vt|, whereS = V0. The goal of IM is to maximize the network scale byselecting seeds S (i.e., active members) as the initial nodesof G0. For simplicity, we start our timestamp from 0, andthe number of seeds remains constant to ensure a fair eval-uation. Therefore, the IM problem on a temporal graph canbe generally defined as: S∗= arg max|S|=Kσ(S, T), where K isthe fixed number of seeds (Yanchenko, Murata, and Holme2023).In-game Recommendation and Propagation. On thegaming platform, we focus on team creation through thein-game teammate recommendation system to study how itsexclusive contribution to teaming behavior. This feature isfundamental across various game modes, supporting bothone-on-one team fights and multi-team battles. The recom-mendation system suggests compatible teammates, therebyenhancing the gaming experience and improving player re-tention. Subsequently, three types of social relationships arederived: exposure, invitation and adoption. Exposure oc-curs when players appear on someone’s recommendationlist, allowing invitations to be sent. If an invitation is ac-cepted, adoption occurs, and the invited player joins the in-viter’s team.Motivated InsightsData from a team-versus-team game developed by NetEaseGames1 indicates that only 25.2% of players used the so-cial recommendation system (sending invitations or adopt-ing system recommendations) over a month-long period.This low engagement suggests that conventional social rec-ommendations are inadequate for most players. Addition-ally, network scale analysis during the same period shows asignificant decline in growth rate: an initial 47.89% increasedrops to 12.05% after the first week and further reduces to2.5% by the end of the month, as shown in Figure 1(a).This trend suggests the network scale will eventually stabi-lize and converge to a constant value. These findings implythat the recommendation system only effectively reaches alimited number of players, resulting in a minimal impact onthe overall social network.Observation 1 LIMITED-COVERAGERECOMMEN-DATION: The recommendation system has a limited impacton the entire social network.Our investigation into the evolution of neighbor countacross timestamps reveals a persistent “cold-start” issue intemporal graphs. As the network scale expands during dif-fusion in the IM problem, the number of neighbors for each1NetEase Games is a leading global developer and publisher ofvideo game IP across a variety of genres and platforms.Figure 1: In the graph constructed from deduplicated edgesderived from daily invitations and adoptions, the proportionof nodes with only one neighbor over the total number ofnodes (y-axis) is presented over a span of 30 days (x-axis).node increases. However, the ratio of nodes with only oneneighbor for social relationships ranges from 12.97% to19.44%, as depicted in Figure 1(b). This underscores thatnodes with few neighbors, reflective of the cold-start issue,constitute a substantial portion of the network. Such nodescan hinder performance when methods depend on social in-formation from their neighborhood. Contrary to the assump-tion that the cold-start issue is confined to initial timestamps,our findings demonstrate its persistence throughout propa-gation in IM problems, leading to compromised diffusionestimation for affected nodes.Observation 2 PERSISTENT COLD-START: The con-secutive presence of the cold-start issue across timestampsresults in an underestimated propagation process.Problem DefinitionThe observed decline in growth, as highlighted in Observa-tion 1, is attributed to recommending acquaintances ratherthan players with the potential to expand the network. Suchrecommendations often lead to internal propagation, com-monly known as the “information cocoon” (Peng and Liu2021). Consequently, Observation 1 prompts us to focus onrecommending specific types of active players who can fa-cilitate broader propagation. This supervised approach dif-fers from most existing IM solutions, which often fail to ex-plain the patterns crucial for expanding network scale. To in-troduce external propagation and break the cocoon, we clas-sify relationships formed through recommendation-driveninvitations/adoption as “strong” relationships, while the ex-posure in the system is deemed “weak” (Definition 1). Anystrong relationships must occur after exposure, making theweak graph an upper bound (Constraint 1) for IM solutions.Definition 1 Given a temporal graph Gt(Vt, Et), the stronggraph Gst(V st , Est ) is a subgraph where V st ⊆Vt and Est ⊆Et, such that ∀et(vti, vtj) ∈Est , both vti and vtj belong to V st .Let Gwt (V wt , Ewt ) = Gt(Vt, Et) represent the weak graph.Constraint 1 |σ (S∗, T)| ≤ST −1t=0 V wt , S∗∈V s0 , whereS∗is the IM solution.The distinction between strong and weak relationships hasbeen extensively studied in previous literature (Granovet-ter 1973; Onnela et al. 2007), denoting high and low estab-lishment probabilities. Traditional recommendation systemsFigure 2: Pipeline for predicting active members. Weak and strong graphs are constructed using exposure edges and invita-tion and adoption edges derived from in-game teammate recommendations, respectively. These graphs are then input into aTensorized TGN to generate node scores. During training, node s","Influence Maximization (IM) in temporal graphs focuses onidentifying influential “seeds” that are pivotal for maximizingnetwork expansion. We advocate defining these seeds throughInfluence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which is essential forscaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently label-ing IPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while address-ing the often-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in tempo-ral networks. Our strategy introduces a motif-based labelingmethod and a tensorized Temporal Graph Network (TGN)tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering pre-diction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, weaugment cold-start nodes with new neighbors from histori-cal data sharing similar IPPs. The recommendation systemwithin an online team-based gaming environment presentssubtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational(i.e., weak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IMstudy. We conduct offline experiments to assess prediction ac-curacy and model training efficiency, complemented by on-line A/B testing to validate practical network growth and theeffectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue."

Compared to standard LLMs, reasoning models lead to redundancy across multiple dimensions.A salient characteristic of reasoning models is their tendency to overthink by generating excessively longreasoning chains (Chen et al., 2024c; Sui et al., 2025a), which has naturally motivated efforts to improveefficiency by shortening reasoning paths. Meanwhile, recent studies (Wu et al., 2025c; Yang et al., 2025c;Jin et al., 2024b) challenge the assumption that longer CoTs always lead to better performance, showingeven negative returns.To address this kind of CoT length redundancy, a range of methods have beenproposed: reinforcement learning (RL) with length penalties (Luo et al., 2025a; Aggarwal & Welleck, 2025),supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on variable-length CoT data (Ma et al., 2025; Xia et al., 2025), and prompt-driven strategies that either guide reasoning paths or route inputs to more efficient solutions (Ding et al., 2024;Aytes et al., 2025). Furthermore, latent reasoning performs the process in latent space without generatingexplicit CoTs, making reasoning chains more concise (Hao et al., 2024; Su et al., 2025).∗Corresponding author1https://github.com/fscdc/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-Models.

We categorize existing efficient reasoning methods into three keydirections based on how they improve reasoning efficiency: (1) make long CoT short (shorter); (2) buildsmall language model with strong reasoning ability (smaller); and (3) let decoding more efficient (faster).In addition to excessively long reasoning chains, reasoning models typically rely on large model sizes toachieve strong reasoning performance (e.g., DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025) has 685B parameters), whichleads to substantial computational and memory costs.To address this, model compression (Han et al.,2016) has proven effective in reducing model size redundancy in standard LLMs, naturally inspiring interestin how these techniques (e.g., distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), quantization (Gray & Neuhoff, 1998), andpruning (LeCun et al., 1989)) can be applied to improve reasoning efficiency. In parallel, another line ofworks directly builds small language models with strong reasoning abilities using RL (Li et al., 2023a; 2025d;Zhu et al., 2024b).Beyond length and model size redundancy, inefficiency can also arise during the decoding stage. To tackle thisissue, a growing body of work focuses on accelerating inference through more efficient decoding strategies.Test-time scaling (TTS) strategies, while enhancing reasoning performance (Snell et al., 2024), also introducelatency redundancy during the decoding stage.Some methods (Sun et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b)specifically target and optimize the speed of certain TTS strategies (Wang et al., 2022). Other approaches,like parallel decoding (Ning et al., 2023) and problem decomposition (Teng et al., 2025), also mitigateinefficiency.This survey aims to provide an overview of research in efficient reasoning.As illustrated in Figure 1,we categorize existing works into three key directions based on the type of redundancy they target: (1)making long CoT short (shorter), which focuses on enabling models to produce shorter reasoning pathswhile maintaining performance; (2) building small language model with strong reasoning abilities (smaller),which aims to develop compact language models with strong reasoning abilities; (3) making decoding moreefficient (faster), which explores strategies to reduce latency during the decoding stage.The following sections of this survey cover the content as outlined below. Section 2 will explore key back-grounds closely related to efficient reasoning.

Various extensions have subsequently been proposed to further enhance reasoning capa-bilities. For instance, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) generalizes the linear CoT structure intoa tree, facilitating the exploration of multiple reasoning paths through backtracking and lookahead strate-gies. Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) (Besta et al., 2024) has expanded this approach into graph structures tobetter capture dependencies and compositional relationships among reasoning steps, substantially improvingreasoning quality. Additionally, some specialized CoT variants are task-specific. PoT (Chen et al., 2022)disentangles reasoning from computation by having the language model generate programmatic reasoningsteps (i.e., expressing thoughts as code), which an external calculator executes to obtain the final answer,making this approach particularly effective for math and financial reasoning tasks. CoS (Hu et al., 2024),on the other hand, targets spatial reasoning by leveraging compressed symbolic representations of spatialrelations to reduce token usage.Scaling test-time computation (TTC) is another road for enhancing reasoning performance. For instance,Best-of-N selects the top-scoring answer from multiple samples, whereas self-consistency chooses the mostconsistent answer across multiple reasoning chains. Initially, the focus of TTS strategies was primarily onmaximizing performance, often at the cost of efficiency. As the demand grew, more recent approaches triedto find ways to improve efficiency without significantly sacrificing performance.

Additionally, an empirical study (Wu et al., 2025b) investigates the trade-offs between the efficiencyand performance of various TTS strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, weighted voting) under different model sizes andcomputation budgets, providing practical insights for further research and deployment.2.2Why We Need Efficient ReasoningEfficiency is a valuable research direction across many fields, and in the context of reasoning, we highlightkey motivations for pursuing efficient reasoning (see Figure 3). Reasoning models often generate excessivelylong reasoning chains to solve reasoning tasks, even for simple samples (see Appendix A.1 for a concreteexample), and typically rely on larger model sizes to achieve stronger reasoning performance. Additionally,some strategies, such as Best-of-N and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022), further scale the decodingprocess to enhance reasoning performance. These lead to substantial computational and memory demands.Moreover, overly long reasoning paths can accumulate errors and negatively impact final accuracy (Wu et al.,2025c; Yang et al., 2025c).On the other hand, efficient reasoning is also essential in real-world applications such as embodied AI (Duanet al., 2022), agent systems (Wang et al., 2024a), and real-time platforms (e.g., autonomous driving (Cuiet al., 2024)). In these scenarios, efficiency enables agents to process sensory inputs in real time, make swiftand accurate decisions, and interact seamlessly with dynamic environments.Additionally, unnecessarilylengthy reasoning may increase safety risks (Kuo et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c), posing unpredictable threats.These challenges collectively highlight the limitations of current reasoning models, underscoring the necessityof improving reasoning efficiency.3Efficient Reasoning3.1Make Long CoT ShortCoT prompting has significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by explicitly generating inter-mediate reasoning steps. However, generating overly long CoTs can lead to negative issues (see Section 2.2).Recent works have explored various approaches to mitigate these drawbacks by shortening CoT lengthwithout compromising reasoning performance. Among them, RL with length penalty is widely used forencouraging concise and effective reasoning paths (see Section 3.1.1). Another line of work explores SFTwith variable-length CoT data to improve reasoning efficiency, as discussed in Section 3.1.2. In addition,prompt-driven techniques improve reasoning efficiency by utilizing prompts, with further details available4Table 1: Overview of efficient reasoning methods in Section 3.1.

Ablation StudiesWe perform ablation studies to assess key components ofTryOffDiff, including the image encoder, adapter module,conditioning feature dimensions, and the impact of fine-tuning a pretrained U-Net versus training from scratch.The configurations for these experiments are summarizedin Tab. 1.

Results arepresented in Tab. 1 (VITON-HD), Tab. 2 (Dress Code), andTab. 3 (p2p-VTON).The results in Tab. 1 reveal key insights into our designchoices.

We evaluateOOTDiffusion (OOTD) with ground truth (GT) garments andTryOffDiff-predicted garments, alongside CatVTON, a special-ized p2p-VTON model. Our TryOffDiff model, when integratedwith a VTON model, achieves competitive performance, eventhough it is not explicitly trained for the p2p task.TryOffAnyone achieves a better score, though TryOffDiffexcels in global metrics like FID and DISTS which is ourprimary metric.In our evaluation on the Dress Code dataset (Tab. 2), weconsider: (i) category-specific TryOffDiff models trainedindividually on dresses, upper-body, and lower-body gar-ments; (ii) a class-conditioned TryOffDiff model trainedjointly on all categories using garment-type embeddings;and (iii) an aggregated result, denoted TryOffDiff-merged,where outputs from the three category-specific models arecombined post hoc. The class-conditioned model remainscompetitive across all categories, demonstrating its robust-ness as a unified solution.For person-to-person virtual try-on (Tab. 3), we integrateTryOffDiff with OOTDiffusion and compare it to CatV-TON, a specialized p2p-VTON model.

Its improvementsin structural similarity and perceptual quality translate intopractical benefits, such as more realistic garment renderingin both VTOFF and p2p-VTON applications.4.4. Qualitative AnalysisFigure 5 illustrates the performance of TryOffDiff in gar-ment reconstruction, comparing two variants:garment-specific models (row 2) and multi-garment model (row3).The conditioning images, displayed in first row, aresourced from VITON-HD (cols 1-3), DressCode upper-body (cols 4-6), lower-body (cols 7-9), and dresses (cols10-12). Garment-specific models excel in precision, partic-ularly for text and fine details (cols 2 and 5), likely due tothe pretrained model initialization. In contrast, the multi-garment model offers versatility, delivering strong perfor-mance across diverse garment types and datasets, albeitwith slight trade-offs in detail compared to specialized mod-els. Nevertheless, it reconstructs a high level of detail (col-umn 6) and shows robust generalization to VITON-HD,which was unseen during training. In some cases (cols 2,7 and 9), it even produces better fidelity of color.Figure 6 illustrates the results of p2p-VTON. Overall,neither method stands out as a definitive winner. CatVTONexcels in preserving texture and pattern details but occa-sionally introduces diffusion artifacts (row 2). It can alsotransfer unintended attributes, such as skin color, from tar-get model to the source model (row 1)–a limitation not ob-served in classical try-on models. OOTDiffusion combinedwith TryOffDiff avoids such attribute transfer issues butmay struggle due to masking, resulting in residual sourcegarment attributes in the output (rows 3 and 4).These results highlight the potential of Virtual Try-Off task and the TryOffDiff model. Although TryOffDiffwas not specifically trained for p2p-VTON, its integrationwith VTON models presents a promising approach, alreadydemonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art person-to-person virtual try-on methods.5. ConclusionIn this paper we propose TryOffDiff, a latent diffusionmodel tailored to Virtual Try-Off.We substitute textconditioning mechanism with adapted SigLIP features tosteer the generative process, enabling effective garmentreconstructions.TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the art re-sults on VITON-HD. Further experiments were conductedon DressCode, which contains three types of garments:upper-body, lower-body and dresses. While the baselinearchitecture can be trained separately for each category,we enhance TryOffDiff by introducing class conditioning.This advancement allows a single model to perform multi-garment reconstruction, successfully capturing all garmenttypes with minimal loss in detail quality. To our knowledge,this is the first method to address multi-garment VTOFF ina unified framework.Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating VTOFF withVTON models enables Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On,achieving performance comparable to specialized models.This pipeline offers practical advantages: it leverages exist-ing VTON models for a wider applications and decouplesgarment reconstruction from other generative artifacts, sim-7Figure 6.

Olives are a kind of ___Do you think olives are fruits?fruit!No.✏ higher generator likelihood $ Poodles are a kind of ___Do you think poodles are mammals?dog, …, mammal?Yes.$!⚖ higher validator likelihood✏⚖ G-V correlation⚖ ✏Figure 1: LLMs often have a discrepancybetween generative and discriminative ver-sions of the same task. They may generateanswers that contradict their discriminativejudgments or endorse responses in whichthe generator has low confidence.LLMs exhibit instability when prompted indifferent ways to answer the same question.One clear manifestation of this is the generator-validator gap (Li et al., 2024b; West et al., 2024;Hu & Frank, 2024), where a model may gen-erate answers that it does not verify as cor-rect, or vice versa. Resolving this inconsis-tency would lead to LLMs that report theirunderlying beliefs more consistently and donot reverse their answers when asked again,and may generally be more useful in evalua-tion settings (Wang et al., 2024c; Zheng et al.,2024).However, this issue is not easily resolved inthe face of epistemic uncertainty. Supposethat a model places probability mass over sev-eral answers to a question. Which of these an-swers should the model validate as correct?For a model to be consistent, the validatorshould not be more confident than the gen-erator: in fact, the generator and validator’sconfidences should be correlated.∗Equal contribution1Our code is available at https://github.com/juand-r/rankalign.1arXiv:2504.11381v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025Preprint. Under review.In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of the generator-validator gap (G-V gap) thatconsiders scores of the entire set of candidate answers at a time. We argue that achievingcorrelation between generator and validator scores across all answers, across all examples,is what is necessary for models to be consistent. Ideally, we want the model to refrainfrom generating responses that they disagree with discriminatively; we also expect themodel to consistently assess answers even when they are less likely to generate the answers,a setting which arises when LMs are used as judges to evaluate arbitrary responses (Shiet al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024a). We show empirically that these correlationsare low for existing open-source LLMs across a range of problems, including questionanswering, probing for lexical semantic knowledge (hypernymy and synonymy), andnext-word prediction.We then describe a new fine-tuning approach, RankAlign, which uses a pairwise ranking-based loss function to align validator rankings to rankings derived from generator logprobabilities. We find this strategy significantly reduces the G-V gap across models by31.8% on average, giving substantially higher correlation between generator and validatoracross the population of sampled instances. Notably, it outperforms the reverse approach ofaligning the generator to the validator. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to unseentasks and to novel lexical items.Our main contributions are: (1) a novel formulation of the generator-validator gap in termsof correlation between log-odds of generators and validators; (2) a ranking-based trainingobjective for improving correlation between generator and validator to close the G-V gap.2Problem FormulationGiving the answer to a question and identifying whether a proposed answer is correct aretwo conceptually (Campbell, 1960) and computationally (Garey & Johnson, 1979) distinctproblems. In the first, generative (generator) case, the LM must select an answer fromamong a combinatorially large set of options. In the second, discriminative (validator) case,the solution (or set of possible solutions) is presented along with the question, and the LMmust select from among a small set of options, such as indicating if an answer is corrector incorrect. LMs (Hu & Frank, 2024; Li et al., 2024b) can give conflicting answers undergenerator and validator versions of the same question. This discrepancy is known as theGenerator-Validator gap (Li et al., 2024b) or task demand gap between production and forcedchoice (Hu & Frank, 2024).Figure 1 shows an example of how this gap can arise. When asked whether poodles aremammals, Gemma-2-2B prefers Yes over No, whereas mammal is a less likely continuationof ‘A poodle is a kind of’ than is the case for other examples with a strong preferencefor Yes, ranking 554th out of all examples. The opposite error can also occur. For example,fruit is an extremely likely continuation for ‘Complete the sentence: Olives are a kindof’ (in fact, it is the most likely token), even though the LM generates No when promptedwith ‘Do you think olives are fruit?’Past work has focused on framing the G-V gap in terms of accuracy of validation decisionswith respect to answers sampled from the generator (Li et al., 2024b); however, the exampleshows that this does not tell the whole story. This formulation fails to consider, for example,the alignment of lower-scoring (but still likely) options. We establish metrics to measure thepervasiveness of this discrepancy, and introduce a new method to help close the gap.SettingWe consider short-form natural language queries—questions which can be an-swered through a single word, entity or multi-word expression. There may be a singlecorrect answer (e.g., TriviaQA), a set of correct answers (e.g., asking what superordinatecategory a concept belongs to), or a a set of answers which vary in their plausibility, whicharise in more subjective tasks such as finding synonyms in context (Kremer et al., 2014), nextword prediction (Paperno et al., 2016), or NLI judgments (Pavlick & Kwiatkowski, 2019).Let the generator prompt xG be the sequence of tokens prompting the model to producean answer, and denote a possible answer to the generator prompt by yA. yA can be any2Preprint. Under review.sequence of tokens to which the LM can assign some probability. xG is often asking aquestion about a specific entity or string (e.g., ‘A poodle is a kind of’, or ‘A synonym ofchagrin is’), so we define a template function G : z →xG to construct generator promptsconcerning some z of interest (e.g., poodle, chagrin).To every generator prompt xG, there corresponds an associated validator prompt xVwhich consists of a polar (Yes/No) question asking whether yA is the correct answerto xG, where yA can take any candidate answer. We construct validator prompts viatemplates V : (z, yA) →xV. Let yV be the token generated from the validator prompt,yV ∼pLM(· | V(z, yA)).For example, one can probe a language model’s knowledge of hypernymy via the following,where z = poodle and yA = mammal:Generator prompt xG = G(z) = A poodle is a kind ofAnswer yA = mammalValidator prompt xV = V(z, yA) = Is it true that a poodle is a mammal?Figure 2: Generator and validator log-odds for Gemma-2-2B for hypernym pre-diction (Pearson ρ = 0.764).Validator prompts empirically have the prop-erty that most of the probability mass for thecompletion yV is concentrated on the Yes or Notokens.Correlation of Log-OddsWe define the G-Vgap so that (1) we measure agreement as a func-tion of continuous generator/validator scoresrather than binary variables, and (2) we evalu-ate on a range of possible completions from thegenerator. We operationalize these desiderata byevaluating the G-V gap through the correlationof generator and validator log-odds over a rangeof (generator, validator) prompts derived froma set of (question, answer) pairs (Figure 2).In the case of a validator prompt, we wish tomeasure the probability mass of Yes tokens, asopposed to everything else. In practice, we ob-served the probability mass is concentrated onyes and no tokens, so we define the validatorlog-odds as:lV(z, yA) = log∑i pLM(Yi | V(z, yA))∑i pLM(Ni | V(z, yA))(1)where Y := [ yes, yes, Yes, Yes ] and N := [no, no, No, No ] are the sets of Yes and Notokens. Similarly, the log-odds of the generator is defined as:lG(z, yA) = logpLM(A | G(z))1 −pLM(A | G(z))(2)where A is the first token of the answer yA, and yA can be any candidate answer to xG.2While the space of effective outputs is much larger for the generator than the validator, wecan measure preferences for chosen answer continuations in both cases using log-odds.Log-odds Correlation (ρ)We measure the consistency between generator and validatoracross the range of answer choices {yAi}i via the Pearson correlation (ρ-all) of their log-odds2While some answers consist of multiple tokens, we observe the first token to be highly informativein most cases; this is discussed in §4.1.3Preprint. Under review.{lG(z, yAi)}z,i and {lV(z, yAi)}z,i. Since this correlation will be higher when generators andvalidators are both accurate (e.g., as in Figure 2) , we also evaluate the Pearson correlationbetween lG and lV restricted to only the set of positive examples P (ρ-pos), or negativeexamples N (ρ-neg).33Training to Improve G-V CorrelationIs an olive a fruit?Validator log odds Is a poodle a mammal?Generator log odds Figure 3: In RankAlign, pairwise logis-tic loss L = −log (σ(uw −ul)) is usedto enforce the pair of validator logprobabilities uw, ul to be ordered asthe generator log probabilities.RankAlign objectivesGiven a model that ex-hibits imperfect correlation between generator andvalidator, how do we go about closing this gap?When considering a single datapoint, it is difficultto calibrate via training what precise log-odds val-ues the generator and the discriminator should re-turn. The correlation relationship is only exhibitedwhen looking at larger collections of points at atime. Our aim is to train a model to improve thiscorrelation. We instantiate a simple objective to dothis, which enforces positive correlation betweentwo sampled prompts. That is, the ranking of thepoints according to the generator and discriminatormust be the same.We introduce a new ranking-based method to closethe G-V gap. We wish to increase the correlationbetween the generator and validator log-odds lGand lV. Rather than optimize for this directly, wecan instead encourage the LM to match the rank-ings of the generator with the validator, or vice versa. Whether one wishes to train an LMto have generator scores aligned with its validator scores, or validator scores aligned withits generator scores, may depend on the ultimate use case and on whether the generator orvalidator is more accurate.We train the model to produce validator log probabilities that are ranked in the same wayas the generator’s log probabilities. Given a dataset of generator prompt-answer pairs{(xGi, Ai)}i, we compute the generator log probabilities log(pLM(Ai | xGi)). This gives riseto a desired ranking between pairs of corresponding validator prompts {(xVl, xVw)} wherexVl ≺xVw whenever log(pLM(Ai | xGl)) < log(pLM(Ai | xGw).In order to encourage the log-odds for Yes to be higher for xVw than for xVl, we propose aranking-based loss function:LG2V(pθ) = −E(xw, xl)∈Dhlog σβ[log pθ(Yes | xVw) −log pθ(Yes | xVl)]i(3)where σ(·) is the sigmoid function, β is a hyperparameter controlling the sensitivity of thepreference comparisons, and D is the set of prompts being sampled from, described in§3. Here pθ is the LM being trained. Note that we are not training the LM to prefer oneresponse over another for a given prompt. Instead, we are training the model to assign higherlikelihood to a given completion (“Yes”) for one prompt compared to another.In the case when β = 1, Eq. 3 simply minimizes the logistic cross-entropy loss overpairs (ul, uw), L = −log","Although large language models (LLMs) have become generally morecapable and accurate across many tasks, some fundamental sources ofunreliability remain in their behavior. One key limitation is their inconsis-tency at reporting the the same information when prompts are changed.In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model’s generatedanswer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap.We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect"

Game-play results are influenced by both themodels’ ability to play the games and their ability to understand the rules and format. For example, some reasoningmodels can sometimes reveal their cards or roles during game-play.1IntroductionScaling large language models has led to remarkable improvements in performance across various benchmarks. Modelslike GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a), Claude (Anthropic, 2024), and Gemini (Gemini, 2024) have achieved near-perfect scoreson traditional benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021). Due to the recentprogress on reasoning models (like OpenAI o1 OpenAI (2024b) and DeepSeek R1 DeepSeek-AI (2025)), even morecomplex evaluations like the ARC-AGI challenge (Chollet et al., 2025) are approaching saturation, suggesting the needfor a new evaluation paradigm.Two ad-hoc solutions to this are extending existing benchmarks (White et al., 2024; Kiela et al., 2021) and coming upwith ever harder benchmarks, like ""Humanity’s Last Exam"" (Phan et al., 2025). However, as models keep improving, itis conceivable that soon it will be infeasible for humans to come up with new, more challenging benchmarks.We argue that a more sustainable alternative to these absolute measures of performance is a relative one. The advantagethereof is that there is no clear upper limit of performance that can be reached, and thus, as long as models differ incapabilities, a ranking can be achieved. Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) follows such a strategy; there, humansselect which of two LLM-generated answers they prefer. However, we aim to further circumvent human costs andbiases, particularly as models approach or exceed the skill level of domain experts, making it increasingly challengingfor humans to judge answer quality effectively and at scale.Thus, we present TextArena, a comprehensive framework for evaluating language models through competitivegameplay. The initial release encompasses 57+ diverse text-based games1, including single-player, two-player, andmulti-player scenarios (see current list in App. A).These games test a wide range of capabilities, including theory of mind, persuasion, deception, spatial reasoning,long-term planning and other social skills that traditional benchmarks typically do not assess. TextArena facilitatesoffline model development/training and online competition between models and human players (both model vs modeland model vs human), with performance tracked through a real-time TrueSkill™(Herbrich et al., 2006) leaderboardthat provides dynamic, relative capability measurements.1As of publication, the collection has grown to 74 games and continues to expand.2TextArenaWithin TextArena, LLMs interact with the environment in a dynamic, challenging and measurable way. Each agentacts based on its understanding of the current state and opponent’s behaviors. The environment provides observationsand rewards, enabling models to refine their strategies over time. This framework, inspired by platforms like OpenAIGym (Brockman et al., 2016), which standardize reinforcement learning interactions, creates opportunities for modelsto develop and demonstrate complex reasoning, negotiation, and decision-making capabilities in dynamic scenarios.The framework’s design emphasizes accessibility and extensibility, inviting researchers to contribute games andadditional evaluation scenarios. Especially verifiable games that separate a specific skill and provide a natural scenariowhere it manifests. This communal and collaborative approach aims to create a living framework that evolves alongsidethe advancing model capabilities, providing sustained value for assessing LLMs.Given the re-animated focus on reinforcement learning, following the release of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025)it is worth emphasizing that TextArena can serve as a source of near infinite training data for reinforcement learningwith a dynamic curriculum of difficulty (via self-play), and thus in addition to improving soft skills like long-termplanning, negotiation, theory of mind or deception, it is conceivable that this may serve as a further scaling paradigmfor multi-turn, agentic reasoning models.Overall, TextArena presents a versatile set of resources for interactive text games:1. A unified framework to describe games between models and a Gym-like framework suitable for RL training.2. 57+ games implemented in this framework.3. UI for humans to play against the models, supporting any games added.4. Leaderboards to compare general models, dedicated models and humans.5. Community support to using, playing, adding models, and further research with TextArena.2Design ChoicesIn developing TextArena, our primary objectives were ease of adoption, use and extension. To address the former two,we kept the code interfaces used as similar to OpenAI Gym (aka Gymnasium) (Brockman et al., 2016) as possible andadopted their philosophy of stack-able wrappers. This design choice makes TextArena particularly well-suited for RL,providing researchers with a unified interface to diverse text-based environments. To further improve extensibility, westreamlined much of the shared game functionalities, making it easy and fast to add new environments to TextArena.To highlight these design choices, below is a short example script, showing how to use TextArena (See App. B for anexample of how to add a model to play online).For more detailed documentation, as well as tutorials for training and evaluation of models, check out textarena.ai.# Initialize agentsagents = {0: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name=""GPT -4o-mini""),1: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name=""anthropic/claude -3.5- haiku""),}# Initialize environmentenv = ta.make(env_id =[""TicTacToe -v0"", ""SpellingBee -v0""])env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)env.reset(num_players=len(agents))done = Falsewhile not done:player_id , observation = env.get_observation ()action = agents[player_id ]( observation)done , info = env.step(action=action)rewards = env.close()3EnvironmentsTo provide a rich and diverse training ground and evaluation set for the models, we have so far created 57+ text-basedgames, including original games, slightly adjusted games and novel games; for single-, two and multi-player setups.3TextArenaFigure 3: Images of some (rendered) TextArena environments.The environments cover a large range of hard and soft skills, including: Reasoning, Theory of Mind, Risk Assessment,Vocabulary Skills, Pattern Recognition, Spatial Reasoning, Planning, Memory, Deception, Negotiation, Persuasion,Resource Management, and many more.Importantly, all games used are either naively text-based or adapted to be text-based.A comprehensive, up-to-date, list of the environments, as well as additional information and documentation for each,can be found on GitHub.4Online EvaluationTextArena employs a dynamic, competitive-based evaluation system to assess model performances of frontier models,community submitted models and humans as a baseline. We match, score and share a leaderboard and statistics on thosemodels. The online leaderboard tracks performance through TrueSkill™(Herbrich et al., 2006), a bayesian skill ratingsystem originally developed for matchmaking in competitive games. This rating system is particularly well-suited forTextArena as it:1. Accurately rates players in both team-based and individual competitions2. Handles matches with varying numbers of players3. In our experiments, consistently converged faster to a reliable skill estimate than the traditional Elo system4. Appropriately manages uncertainty for new participantsEach model is initialized with a TrueSkill™rating (µ = 25, σ = 253 ), with ratings adjusted after every match. Humanplayers are collectively represented as ""Humanity"" on the leaderboard, providing a natural benchmark against which tomeasure model performance. This approach enables direct comparison between different models and between modelsand human players, creating a comprehensive ranking system that evolves as participants’ abilities change over time.Beyond overall performance, TextArena provides deeper insight into model capabilities through soft-skill profiling.Each environment is tagged with up to five soft skills (Strategic Planning, Spatial Thinking, Pattern Recognition,Theory of Mind, Logical Reasoning, Memory Recall, Bluffing, Persuasion, Uncertainty Estimation, and Adaptability)with corresponding weights. As models accumulate ratings across multiple environments, their aptitude in each skillcategory is estimated by calculating the weighted average of relevant environment scores.4TextArenaThis granular evaluation reveals specific strengths and weaknesses across models (Figure 1), providing researchers withactionable insights beyond overall rankings. For instance, while two models might achieve similar aggregate scores,one might excel at Uncertainty Estimation and Bluffing while the other demonstrates superior Persuasion capabilities.The online competition system facilitates both Model vs Model and Model vs human play across our diverse library ofenvironments. This multi-faceted evaluation approach provides a more nuanced understanding of model capabilitiescompared to static benchmarks. This is particularly relevant for assessing social skills like negotiation, deception, andtheory of mind.While we impose no formal restrictions on model submissions, we encourage researchers to submit different modelvariants under distinct names to maintain clarity in the leaderboard. So far, we have evaluated 283 models online,including community submissions and the 64 official models hosted by the platform. This openness supports our goalof creating a collaborative community around TextArena while still providing meaningful comparative evaluations2.5Related WorkBenchmark/StudyNumber of EnvironmentsGym-Compatible APIOnline EvaluationModel vs ModelModel vs HumanSingle-PlayerTwo-PlayerMulti-PlayerClembench (Chalamalasetti et al., 2023)050✗✗✓✗LMRL-Gym (Abdulhai et al., 2023)530✓✗✓✗GameBench (Costarelli et al., 2024)036✓✗✓✓Game-theoretic LLM (Hua et al., 2024)0110✗✗✓✗LAMEN (Davidson et al., 2024)060✗✗✓✗GTBench (Duan et al., 2024)0100✗✗✓✗GameArena (Hu et al., 2024)030✗✗✗✓SPIN-Bench (Yao et al., 2025)132✓✗✓✗TextArena (Ours)164711✓✓✓✓Table 1: Comparison of recent benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in game-based interactionscenarios. The table summarizes the number of supported environments (Single-Player, Two-Player, Multi-Player),Gym-compatible API availability, online evaluation support, and capabilities for model-vs-model and model-vs-humaninteraction.Table 1 provides a comprehensive comparison of recent benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs)in game-based interaction scenarios. We analyze these frameworks across seven key dimensions: the number ofenvironments in three categories (single-player, two-player, and multi-player games) and four technical capabilities(Gym-compatible API, online evaluation support, model versus model evaluation, and model versus human evaluation).Existing benchmarks exhibit varied strengths and limitations. Clembench (Chalamalasetti et al., 2023) offers fivetwo-player text-based environments with model versus model capabilities but lacks Gym compatibility and humanevaluation features. LMRL-Gym (Abdulhai et al., 2023) provides five single-player and three two-player environmentswith a Gym-compatible API, though it lacks human evaluation support. GameBench (Costarelli et al., 2024) offersgreater environment diversity with three two-player and six multi-player games, supporting both Gym compatibilityand human evaluation capabilities.More specialized frameworks include Game-theoretic LLM (Hua et al., 2024) with eleven two-player environmentsand LAMEN (Davidson et al., 2024) with six two-player environments, both supporting model versus model evaluationbut lacking other technical capabilities. GTBench (Duan et al., 2024) concentrates on ten two-player game-theoreticenvironments but offers limited technical features. GameArena (Hu et al., 2024) specializes in three two-playerenvironments with human evaluation as its distinguishing feature. SPIN-Bench (Yao et al., 2025) provides a balanceddistribution with one single-player, three two-player, and two multi-player environments, offering Gym compatibilityand model versus model evaluation.TextArena (our proposed benchmark) addresses these limitations by providing the most comprehensive coverageacross all dimensions. With 16 single-player, 47 two-player, and 11 multi-player environments, TextArena offerssubstantially greater variety than existing benchmarks. It is the only framework that fully supports all four technicalcapabilities, enabling flexible evaluation across different interaction scenarios, reinforcement learning applications, andboth model-to-model and model-to-human evaluations within a unified, extensible platform.2Live leaderboard: https://www.textarena.ai/leaderboard5TextArena6Future DirectionsIn the future, we hope to extend TextArena in several ways.• RL training: Training reasoning models on game environments.

34,K-means Enhanced Density Gradient Analysis for Urban and Transport Metrics Using Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery.pdf,"or ’variation’ (areas with higher fluctuations in density). This data-driven approach ensures objectiveidentification of urban structural patterns without relying on subjective visual interpretation.As a result of this analysis, distinct regional characteristics emerged for each city. Malbork’s differenceplot exhibits a remarkably uniform pattern extending approximately 1.4 km from the center (Region 1in Figure 6a, highlighted in green), with minimal deviation from the regression model. This uniformityindicates a well-defined, coherent urban core with consistent density—a characteristic ideal for hub-basedpublic transport systems. Beyond this 1.4 km radius, the plot begins to show a variable region (Region2, 1.4-4.96 km) of multiple medium-height peaks, representing secondary density nodes at intermediatedistances. At farther distances (Region 3, 4.96-8.1 km), the peaks demonstrate higher amplitude but widerspacing, indicating sparse but concentrated satellite developments. The entire variable region spans from1.4 to 8.1 km, as clearly visualized in Figure 6a. This pattern aligns with Malbork’s visual appearancein both optical and SAR imagery (Figures 2a, 2c), which shows a compact central area surrounded bydistinct, separated development clusters.In contrast, Kłodzko’s difference plot shows perturbations throughout the entire urban extent, in-cluding areas proximal to the center. As illustrated in Figure 6b, Kłodzko exhibits a completely variablepattern with no uniform region, with the variable region extending from 0 to 8.4 km. The analysis re-veals three distinct regions: Region 1 (0-1.7 km), Region 2 (1.7-4.65 km), and Region 3 (4.65-8.4 km),all characterized by significant perturbations. Both perturbation frequency and amplitude increase pro-portionally with distance from the identified centers.This pattern indicates a less centralized, moreheterogeneously distributed urban structure with multiple density nodes of comparable significance. Theconsistent presence of peaks even near the nominal ""center"" suggests that Kłodzko lacks a dominantcentral core, reflecting its development constraints imposed by valley topography. These observations areconsistent with the optical and SAR imagery analysis (Figures 2b, 2d), which reveals a more dispersedurban pattern following topographical features.The gradient coefficient (α) values provide further quantitative evidence of the morphological dif-ferences between the two cities. Malbork’s steeper gradient (α = −0.018/km) compared to Kłodzko’smore gradual decline (α = −0.013/km) confirms that Malbork has a more centralized urban structurewith density decreasing more rapidly with distance from the center. This steeper gradient typically indi-cates urban forms that can more efficiently support traditional hub-and-spoke public transport networks[27, 28].The minimum effective distance (LD) metric further illustrates the transport planning implicationsof these different urban forms. Malbork’s LD value of 21.8 km compared to Kłodzko’s 23.4 km indicatesthat Kłodzko requires a larger service area to effectively cover its population due to its more disperseddevelopment pattern. This finding aligns with established research showing that more compact urban12Figure 6: Regional analysis of urban density gradient differences: (a) Malbork with three distinct regions(left) and (b) Kłodzko with three regions (right). Green background indicates uniform regions, and redbackground highlights highly variable regions. For Malbork, Region 1 (0-1.41 km) shows remarkable uni-formity, while Regions 2 (1.41-4.96 km) and 3 (4.96-8.10 km) display increasing variability. For Kłodzko,all regions—Region 1 (0-1.70 km), Region 2 (1.70-4.65 km), and Region 3 (4.65-8.41 km)—display sig-nificant variability with no uniform central region.forms generally enable more efficient public transport service coverage [28, 41].Our analysis revealed potential methodological limitations that should be addressed in future studies.We found that the gradient and density metrics may vary depending on the threshold definitions derivedfrom histogram decomposition. This sensitivity suggests that adding additional channels to the combinedimage could increase value resolution, resulting in more precise decomposition and ultimately better-defined gradient factors. While our current segmentation algorithms yield consistent results that alignwith the literature, further refinements could improve accuracy and robustness. Particularly, enhancededge detection techniques and more sophisticated multi-modal fusion approaches could better delineateurban boundaries in complex topographical settings like those found in Kłodzko.The validity of our data is further supported by consistency across multiple Polish cities beyond thosepresented in this study.However, we recognize that threshold sensitivity could introduce variability13when applying our methodology to dramatically different urban morphologies or in regions with signifi-cantly different built environment characteristics. Future research should explore adaptive thresholdingtechniques that automatically adjust to regional architectural and urban planning differences.Our findings suggest promising directions for future research, particularly in developing optimizationalgorithms for urban transportation systems based on the parameters identified in this study. Since the αcoefficient, LD metric, and region characteristics demonstrate consistency across our analysis, they couldserve as input variables for models that define optimal urban transportation systems. This approach isplanned for our next research phase, along with more comprehensive analysis of a larger sample of cities.Even with the current data, our urban morphology classification provides clear guidance for publictransportation strategies. For Malbork, the well-defined uniform Region 1 indicates an ideal environmentfor a centralized hub-based transit system, while the surrounding variable regions would benefit fromfeeder services connecting to this hub. In contrast, Kłodzko’s lack of a uniform central region and its threedistinct variable regions suggest the need for a distributed transit system with multiple interconnectedroutes rather than a single dominant hub. This three-tiered communication scheme would better serveKłodzko’s dispersed urban pattern and accommodate its topographical constraints.6Conclusions and Future WorkOur research demonstrates that multi-modal satellite imagery analysis effectively informs urban plan-ning through density gradient quantification. By combining optical and SAR data, we’ve developed amethodology that segments urban areas, identifies centers, and calculates key morphological metrics.The density gradient coefficient (α), minimum effective distance (LD), and K-means identified regions(R1-R3) provide powerful tools for understanding urban structure and infrastructure requirements.The comparative analysis of Malbork and Kłodzko reveals how different morphologies demand distinctstrategies. Malbork’s monocentric structure with a uniform central region (α = −0.018/km) suggests anideal environment for hub-based transit, while Kłodzko’s polycentric pattern (α = −0.013/km) requiresa distributed network with multiple interconnected routes.Despite promising results, our approach would benefit from enhanced image channel integration.Future work could incorporate temporal analysis, develop predictive models based on our density metrics(α, LD) and region classification (R1-R3), and minimize dependence on external socioeconomic data.Optimization algorithms using these parameters could define urban transportation systems tailored tospecific morphologies without requiring traditional surveys.This methodology offers planners a cost-effective, globally applicable approach using freely availablesatellite data.

Here we present Taccel, a high-performancesimulation platform that integrates Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) and AffineBody Dynamics (ABD) to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with bothaccuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators thatoperate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel providesprecise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexiblerobot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs.

These capabili-ties position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research anddevelopment. By enabling large-scale simulation and experimentation with tactilesensing, Taccel accelerates the development of more capable robotic systems,potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physicalenvironment.1IntroductionThe ability to physically interact with the environment through touch is fundamental to roboticmanipulation [3, 13]. While vision provides global scene understanding, tactile sensing capturescrucial local contact information [55] essential for precise manipulation. Among various tactilesensing technologies [61, 24, 36, 25], vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) such as GelSight [59] and9DTact [35] have emerged as a central focus in tactile research. Their ability to provide high-resolutiontactile feedback through camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads, combined withcost-effectiveness, has driven significant advances in robotics [63, 33, 44, 8, 62].The primary challenge in scaling up VBTS-equipped robot simulation lies in accurately modelingthe hyperelastic soft gel pad and its contact [63, 12]. Current approaches follow two main directions:rigid-body approximations [49, 54] and soft-body simulations [44, 8, 12, 20, 28, 63]. While rigid-body methods efficiently support basic tasks like pick-and-place [1, 49], they cannot capture thefine-grained contactsd and elastomer deformations essential for complex manipulation tasks [63, 12]Preprint.

The simulation shows anAllegro robotic hand equipped with four VBTSs performing a precision grasp on a mahjong tile. The sensor onthe thumb actively presses against the tile’s face, while other fingers maintain a stable grip. The left inset showsthe mahjong tile with its characteristic Chinese character marking. The right inset displays the tactile sensor’soutput as a depth map (green-yellow colormap, scale in millimeters), where brighter regions indicate deeperdeformation of the gel pad. This depth information precisely captures the geometric features of the tile’s surface,demonstrating the simulator’s capability to generate realistic tactile feedback during complex manipulation tasks.Table 1: Comprehensive comparison of FEM-based VBTS simulators.

Soft-body simulations offer higher fidelity but facesignificant computational challenges that limit their practical application in large-scale experiments.An ideal VBTS simulator must simultaneously achieve:• Precision: precise modeling of robots, sensors, and objects with physically valid solutions, particu-larly maintaining inversion-free and intersection-free states during complex contact interactions;generation of realistic tactile signals across multiple resolutions, from high-resolution RGB patternsand depth maps to low-resolution marker movements.• Scalability: Capability for large-scale parallel simulation for extensive data generation and algo-rithm development.• Flexibility: Support for diverse robotic platforms and sensor configurations, from parallel grippersto multi-finger hands with varying sensor arrangements.As detailed in Tab. 1, existing solutions often compromise on precision, scalability, or flexibility.They typically produce suboptimal physics, operate slower than real-time with limited parallelenvironments, or focus on specific sensor setups or simple grippers. These limitations significantlyimpede the broader application of tactile robotics.To address these challenges, we present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform for scalingup robots with VBTS-integration. Built on state-of-the-art simulation techniques (Sec. 3), Taccelprovides dedicated components for simulating robots (Sec. 4), tactile sensors (Sec. 5), and tactile2signal generation (Sec. 6). Comprehensive evaluations (Sec. 7) demonstrate its effectiveness acrossall objectives:• Precision: Taccel leverages advanced solid material simulation techniques, combining IPC [30]and ABD [29] to ensure physical accuracy. The platform models gel pads using neo-Hookeansolids with IPC guaranteeing inversion- and intersection-free contact solutions, while integratingABD for efficient and precise simulation of robot links and stiff objects. This combination enablesprecise physics simulation and support realistic tactile signal generation.• Scalability: With an efficient implementation of the ABD-IPC system using NVIDIA warp [39],Taccel achieves unprecedented parallelization. On a single H100 GPU, it reaches over 900 FPS(4096 environments, 18ˆ wallclock time) for a peg-insertion task with dual sensors and 12.67 FPS(256 environments, 0.25ˆ wallclock time) for a dexterous manipulation scenario with full-handtactile sensing.• Flexibility: Taccel provides user-friendly APIs for seamless integration of diverse roboticplatforms and sensor configurations. Users can easily load and configure robots through UnifiedRobot Description Format (URDF) with auxiliary configurations, supporting applications fromsimple grippers to complex manipulation tasks, like the mahjong tile sensing task in Fig. 1.We validate Taccel through three fundamental tactile-informed robotic tasks (Sec. 8). In objectclassification, models trained solely on Taccel’s synthetic tactile signals demonstrate strong gen-eralization to real-world data without adaptation. In grasping experiments across four robotic handdesigns, we showcase the platform’s versatility in handling diverse robot configurations and tactilesignal types. In articulated object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate Taccel’s physical fidelitythrough close correspondence between simulated and real-world robot behavior.Our key contributions include: (i) development of a high-performance simulation platform combiningprecise physics modeling, realistic tactile signal generation, and massive parallelization; (ii) imple-mentation of user-friendly APIs enabling flexible robot-sensor integration and high-fidelity tactilesignal synthesis; (iii) comprehensive evaluation of the platform’s precision and scalability; and (iv)extensive experimental validation across diverse tactile robotics applications. By enabling large-scale,high-fidelity simulation of VBTS-equipped robots, Taccel aims to accelerate future research intactile robotics.2Related Work2.1Robot Tactile SensorsTactile sensing plays a fundamental role in precise manipulation, as established by neuroscientificstudies [52, 27, 26, 3]. This understanding has driven the development of artificial tactile sensingsystems for robots [41]. Among these, VBTSs have gained prominence by offering high-resolutionsensing with cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity [59, 51, 35, 33]. While these sensors haveadvanced robotic manipulation [42, 38, 63], their development remains constrained by the reliance onphysical hardware experimentation. Taccel addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensivesimulation platform to accelerate research and development in tactile robotics.2.2Simulating VBTSsEarly VBTS simulators focused on normal deformation scenarios, approximating hyperelastic behav-ior through geometric computations and surface modifications [17, 49, 54, 1, 43]. While efficient ingenerating high-resolution tactile signals through physics-based rendering, these approaches inade-quately capture elastomer dynamics during complex manipulation tasks, especially those involvingtangential forces and continuous interactions [63].Recent approaches have achieved higher physical fidelity by incorporating advanced solid materialsimulation techniques. Methods using Material Point Methods (MPM) [46, 21, 22] and Finite ElementMethods (FEM) [30, 29] better model elastomer properties through time-integrated deformationcomputations [10, 8, 44, 12]. Notable improvements include the adoption of IPC [30] by severalsimulators [12, 8], providing robust contact handling with guaranteed inversion- and intersection-freesolutions. Tab. 1 compares key features of representative approaches.3Taccel builds on these advances by combining IPC and ABD in a unified platform, achieving bothphysical accuracy and computational efficiency while supporting diverse robot configurations andenabling large-scale parallel simulation for robot learning applications.2.3Tactile-Informed Robotic TasksTactile sensing enhances robotic capabilities across three fundamental domains through precisecontact interaction measurements:PerceptionTactile feedback enables sophisticated object understanding through contact-basedsensing. Applications include shear and slip detection [60, 11], object classification and pose estima-tion [32, 56, 47, 2], material property inference [18, 23], and interaction reconstruction [47, 58, 55].These perceptual capabilities form the foundation for advanced manipulation algorithms.GraspingStable grasping requires precise control of contact forces to balance external loads [15,45]. Tactile sensing provides direct force-torque feedback essential for diverse grasping strategies [37,34, 57]. This tactile information complements vision-based approaches by enabling fine-grainedcontact monitoring and in-hand adjustments [6, 5].ManipulationTactile feedback enables complex manipulation beyond basic pick-and-place opera-tions. Applications include precision tasks like peg insertion [8], object pivoting [20], and articulatedobject manipulation [64, 3]. Systems such as Tac-Man [63] and DoorBot [50] demonstrate how tactilesensing guides contact geometry understanding and articulation control. This sensing modality isparticularly crucial for high-frequency object tracking during dexterous manipulation.We validate Taccel’s capabilities through three representative applications: (i) multi-platformrobotic grasping with both rigid and soft objects, (ii) object classification using purely synthetictraining data with strong real-world transfer, and (iii) articulated object manipulation includingdrawers, cabinets, and bolt-nut assembly tasks, extending the Tac-Man framework [63].3Unified IPC Simulation in TaccelThis section presents the unified IPC simulation framework in Taccel, detailing its mathematicalfoundations and implementation principles. For complete derivations, we refer readers to the originalIPC [30] and ABD [29] works.3.1Problem Formulation and Soft Body DynamicsWe consider ns tetrahedralized soft bodies discretized into Ns vertices with positions x1, x2, ..., xNsin Cartesian space. The system state is represented by the stacked position vector x “rxT1 , xT2 , ..., xTNssT P R3Ns.

The potential energy V pxq comprises two terms: an elastic energy Φpxq utilizing theNeo-Hookean constitutive model for hyperelastic materials (characterized by Young’s modulus E andPoisson’s ratio ν), and external forces Eextpxq. The elastic energy is defined as Φpxq “şΩΨpxqdx,where Ψpxq denotes elastic energy density over the volume region Ωof all objects in rest configura-tion.3.2Time SteppingSubstituting Lpx, 9xq into the Euler-Lagrange equation BLBx px, 9xq´ ddtBLBx px, 9xq “ 0 yields the govern-ing dynamics:M:x “ ´dVdx pxq.(1)We temporally discretize Eq.

The method operates on surface contact pairsB, comprising point-triangle and edge-edge pairs from the surface meshes of soft and affine objects.For each contact pair k P B with distance dk ą 0, IPC defines two key energy terms. First, a barrierenergy that prevents interpenetration:bpdkpxqq “ ´´dk ´ ˆd¯2logpdkˆdqItdkPp0, ˆdqupdkq,(6)where ˆd ą 0 is the distance threshold for contact force activation and Ip¨q is the indicator function.Second, an approximated friction potential energy:Dkpx, xnq “ µλnkf0p∥uk∥q,(7)where xn represents the configuration at the previous timestep tn, λnk is the magnitude of the laggednormal contact force, and uk P R2 denotes the tangential relative displacement in the local contactframe.

As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-levelpaintings by collecting an artist’s work and fine-tuning the model,leading to concerns about artworks’ copyright infringement. Totackle these issues, previous studies either add visually impercep-tible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectablewatermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However,when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., mod-ification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible,these strategies might not be viable.To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use audit-ing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea ofArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been fine-tuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the fea-tures related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a styleextractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations andtreats artworks as samplings of an artist’s style.

These models typically functionby gradually refining a random pattern of pixels into a coherentimage that matches the text, making them suitable for a variety ofcreative and practical applications [3, 32, 35, 37, 42, 46, 53, 66].1https://www.scenario.com/arXiv:2504.13061v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025WWW ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaLinkang Du et al.Relevance to the Web and the Security and Privacy Track.These models are rapidly gaining popularity among users throughweb platforms due to their impressive capabilities, including openAPI interfaces and open-source implementations. For example, Mid-journey receives around 32 million pageviews per day at around7.5 pageviews per visit [22]. With the rapid development of text-to-image models, a user with little painting experience can use promptsto generate artwork at a professional level. As one of the sensationalevents, Jason M. Allen created his digital artwork with Midjour-ney and took first place in the digital category at the ColoradoState Fair [51]. Recently, many platforms allow users to uploadartworks and train the models that can generate artworks of similarstyle [7, 40, 53]. The ease of generating artwork using GAI mightdevalue the skill and expression involved in human-made artwork,diminishing the appreciation of human creativity. For instance, theartists feel that their unique styles are being appropriated whenthe market is flooded with AI-mimicked artworks [56]. This raisesquestions about dataset infringement, highly relevant to “securityand privacy of machine learning and AI applications.”Existing Solutions. To protect the intellectual property (IP) ofartists, a series of strategies have been proposed [4, 5, 11, 12, 38, 56,63, 70, 75]. The existing solutions can be classified into two cate-gories by the underlying technologies, i.e., the perturbation-basedmethods [5, 56, 63, 75] and the watermark-based methods [11, 36,39, 65, 77]. The perturbation-based methods introduce subtle pertur-bations that alter the latent representation in the diffusion process,causing models to be unable to generate images as expected. Thewatermark-based methods inject imperceptible watermarks intoartworks before they are shared. The diffusion model collects andlearns the watermarked artworks. The artists can then validate theinfringements by checking if the watermarks exist in the generatedimages. Membership inference (MI) [2, 4, 6, 58] is another techniqueto determine whether specific data was used to train or fine-tunethe diffusion model [15, 26, 43, 67].However, previous studies face several limitations. First, boththe perturbation-based and the watermark-based methods needto manipulate the original images, i.e., injecting perturbation orwatermark, thus compromising data fidelity. The perturbation mayalso diminish the model’s generation quality. Second, perturbation-based and watermark-based strategies require retraining the modelto be effective. Thus, they may not suit the model already postedonline. For the MI methods, the existing approaches [15, 17, 24, 29,41, 44] for diffusion models usually require the access to structureor weights of the model, which limits their applicability in black-box auditing scenarios. Although some MI strategies target theblack-box settings [12, 14, 26, 43, 67, 73], they are not well suitedto our auditing task. We will go depth in Section 4.4 and comparethem with ArtistAuditor in Section 5.Our Proposal. In this paper, we propose a novel artwork copyrightauditing method for the text-to-image models, called ArtistAuditor,which can identify data-use infringement without sacrificing theartwork’s fidelity. We are inspired by the fact that artworks withinan artist’s style share some commonality in latent space. Thus, theauditor can mine the style-related features in an artist’s works toform the auditing basis. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram ofArtistAuditor, where the core components are the style extractorStyle Extractor (Image to Latent Space)Artwork of Artist AMimicked Artworkof Artist AArtwork of Artist BStyle Representationsof Artist AStyle Representationsof Artist BDiscriminatorFigure 1: Intuitive explanation of ArtistAuditor.

Since the entire feature space retains a variety ofinformation about the artwork (e.g., objects, locations, and color),the auditor needs to extract the style-related features at differentlevels of granularity. The auditor then adopts a discriminator topredict the conference score. The discriminator outputs a positiveresult if the generated images closely match the style of the artist;otherwise, it outputs a negative prediction. Finally, we leverage twostrategies to process the confidence scores and derive the decision.Evaluation. Our experimental results on three popular diffusionmodels (Stable Diffusion v2.1 [60], Stable Diffusion XL [45], andKandinsky [49]) and two artistic datasets (Wikiart [62] and self-collected dataset) consistently achieve AUC values of ArtistAuditorabove 0.937. By comparing original artworks with mimicked ones,we find that ArtistAuditor can accurately identify imitations thatdiffer in content from the originals but pirate the artist’s style. Inaddition, we evaluate four influential factors from two aspects forthe practical adoption of ArtistAuditor. The first aspect focuseson the transferability of ArtistAuditor. In practice, the auditor isunaware of the selected artworks or the image captioning modelused to fine-tune the suspicious model. Thus, we assess the trans-ferability of ArtistAuditor between datasets and models. When theselected artworks are disjoint with those to fine-tune the suspiciousmodel, the auditing accuracy of ArtistAuditor only drops by 2.6%compared to the complete overlap scenario on the Kandinsky model.For different captioning models, ArtistAuditor can still maintain anaccuracy of 85.3% and a false positive rate below 13.3%. The sec-ond aspect focuses on the core modules of ArtistAuditor, namelydata augmentation and distortion calibration. Data augmentationaims to increase the number of artworks available for training dis-criminators. Distortion calibration is used to mitigate the negativeimpact on auditing accuracy of potential stylistic distortions in thegeneration process. The results demonstrate that both modules en-hance the accuracy of ArtistAuditor in most experimental settings.Finally, we show the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-worldcases by a commercial platform Scenario.ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation ModelsWWW ’25, April 28-May 2, 2025, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaContributions. Our contributions are three-fold:• To our knowledge, ArtistAuditor is the first dataset auditingmethod to use multi-granularity style representations as an in-trinsic fingerprint of the artist. ArtistAuditor is an efficient andscalable solution, using under 13.18 GB of GPU memory perartist and enabling parallel auditing due to decoupling processesamong artists.• We show the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor on three mainstreamdiffusion models. By systematically evaluating ArtistAuditor fromseveral aspects, i.e., the dataset transferability, the model trans-ferability, and the impact of the different modules, we summarizesome useful guidelines for adopting ArtistAuditor in practice.• By implementing ArtistAuditor on the online model fine-tuningplatform Scenario, we show that ArtistAuditor can serve as apotent auditing solution in real-world text-to-image scenarios.1.1Ethical Use of Data and Informed ConsentWe strictly followed ethical guidelines by using publicly available,open-source datasets and models under licenses permitting researchand educational use. As these datasets were curated and released bythird parties, direct informed consent was not applicable. However,we are committed to ethical data use and will comply with alllicensing terms for any future modifications or redistribution.2Background2.1Text-to-Image GenerationGenerative adversarial network (GAN) [9, 20, 27] and diffusionmodel (DM) [25, 48, 50] have been used in text-to-image tasks.GAN in this space might struggle with the fidelity and diversityof the images. Inspired by the physical process of diffusion, whereparticles spread over time, DM represents a significant developmentin generative models. These models function through a two-phaseprocess: a forward process that gradually adds noise to an imageover a series of steps until it becomes random noise and a reverseprocess where the model learns to reverse this, reconstructing theimage from noise. The forward process gradually adds noise to animage 𝑥0 over a series of steps 𝑇. This process can be representedas a Markov chain, where each step adds Gaussian noise.𝑥𝑡= √𝛼𝑡𝑥𝑡−1 + √1 −𝛼𝑡𝜖𝑡,(1)where 𝑥𝑡is the noisy image at step 𝑡, 𝑥𝑡−1 is the image from theprevious step, 𝜖𝑡is the noise added at step 𝑡sampled from a normaldistribution, i.e., 𝜖𝑡∼N (0, 𝐼). 𝛼𝑡is a variance schedule determininghow much noise to add at each step. It’s a predefined sequence ofnumbers between 0 and 1.The model learns to generate images by reversing the noiseaddition in the reverse process. At step 𝑡, the model predicts thenoise 𝜖𝑡added in the forward process and then uses this to computethe previous step’s image 𝑥𝑡−1.𝑥𝑡−1 =1√𝛼𝑡𝑥𝑡−1 −𝛼𝑡√1 −¯𝛼𝑡𝜖𝜃(𝑥𝑡,𝑡),(2)where 𝜖𝜃(𝑥𝑡,𝑡) is the noise predicted by the model (parameterizedby 𝜃), given 𝑥𝑡and the time step 𝑡. ¯𝛼𝑡is the cumulative product of𝛼𝑖up to step 𝑡, i.e., ¯𝛼𝑡= Î𝑡𝑖=1 𝛼𝑖. The model starts with a sample ofpure noise 𝑥𝑇∼N (0, 𝐼) and applies this denoising step iterativelyOriginal ArtworkMimicked ArtworkTraining with Original ArtworkFine-tuning with Original ArtworkOriginal ArtworkMimicked ArtworkFigure 2: An example of stylistic imitation by Stable Diffusion.Left: original artwork. Right: generated artwork.to arrive at a generated data point 𝑥0. The model training involveslearning the parameters 𝜃to accurately predict the noise 𝜖𝑡ateach step. Diffusion models excel at generating highly detailed andcoherent images, showing great flexibility and stability in training.2.2Style PiracyTechnique. The concept of style piracy in the text-to-image fieldrefers to using diffusion models to create images that closely resem-ble a specific artistic style. The first way is to train the diffusionmodels from scratch on a large dataset of images that includes thetarget artist’s artworks. It allows the model to learn and replicatethe artist’s style. A simple style piracy directly queries a text-to-image model using the artist’s name. For instance, on the left ofFigure 2, we utilize Stable Diffusion to imitate the style of artworks.However, since the huge overhead for training the diffusionmodels, the adversary tends to fine-tune diffusion models for stylepiracy, i.e., adjusting the diffusion models by a small set of the targetartist’s artwork [18, 23, 31, 52]. This dataset encompasses uniqueelements like specific brushwork, color schemes, and compositionaltechniques characteristic of the artist’s style. The fine-tuning pro-cess involves continuous learning and adjustment to enhance themodel’s ability to apply these style characteristics accurately to var-ious contents. On the right of Figure 2, we demonstrate the model’simitation ability after fine-tuning.3Problem Statement3.1System and Threat ModelApplication Scenarios. Comparing training the diffusion modelsfrom scratch, the adversary can easily implement style piracy byfine-tuning the models.

Extensive ex-periments are conducted based on various DGSS settingsand five different datsets as unseen target domains. Thequalitative and quantitative results demonstrate that ourmethod significantly outperforms alternative approacheswith stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial atten-tion, and superior generalization ability.In particular,DepthForge exhibits outstanding performance under ex-treme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available athttps://github.com/anonymouse-xzrptkvyqc/DepthForge.1. IntroductionDomain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS)aims to improve prediction accuracy across multiple un-seen domains without requiring access to their data, therebyensuring robust generalization for practical applications[33, 44, 52]. One common approach involves decompos-ing the learned features into domain-invariant and domain-specific components [41, 46]. This method aims to achieverobustness against domain variations by isolating content-related factors from those that vary between domains. Asecond strategy employs meta-learning techniques [23],which focus on training models to generalize effectivelyacross domains by learning more adaptable representations,often leveraging shared structures across different datasets.Recently, VFMs have emerged as a promising approach,primarily owing to their strong generalization capabilities,which are enabled by pre-trained on large-scale datasets[14, 24, 35]. Fine-tuning these models has become increas-ingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness and superiorperformance [2, 43]. However, a significant challenge re-mains: what constitutes robust feature information for do-1arXiv:2504.12753v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025main generalization, and how can such robust informa-tion be effectively extracted? Previous methods predomi-nantly utilize VFMs based on RGB images. However, theinherent limitations of RGB prevent those methods fromadapting to variable conditions, especially in scenarios suchas nighttime, overexposure, snow, or fog, where visual cuesare not clearly present. This clearly fails to meet the re-quirements of domain-generalized semantic segmentation.In this paper, we introduce DepthForge, a robust fine-tuning and optimization strategy for domain generalizationsemantic segmentation, as shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, weemploy two frozen VFMs: Depth Anything V2[48, 49] isdedicated to extract depth information, and DINOv2[29] orEVA02[14] are used to process RGB visual features. Weenhance the generalization of the visual features at eachlayer of the VFMs by integrating the corresponding depthcues. More importantly, we introduce depth-aware learn-able tokens that enable the model to learn spatial structureinvariance, thereby ensuring consistent performance acrossdifferent domains. The depth and visual features extractedfrom frozen VFMs are used to optimize the representa-tion of our learnable tokens, thus producing more robustvisual-spatial attention features than those based solely onvisual cues and forging geometric consistency, as shown inFig. 1(b). However, we observe that the frozen VFMs onlyprovide static features, they are incapable of refining thefeature maps during training. This limitation leads to per-sistent errors in the learnable tokens, causing the optimiza-tion process to drift in incorrect directions that are difficultto rectify.To this end, we propose a depth refinementdecoder that dynamically adjusts the multi-scale features,combining prior features and dynamic features to establishhigh-quality paired feature relationships at different depthspaces.The effectiveness of our design is verified by exper-iments on widely used Cityscapes, ACDC, Mapillary,BDD100k, and GTA5 datasets. In addition, the individualcomponents of our design are also verified by extensive ex-periments. Extensive experiments have demonstrated thatour method significantly improves DGSS performance, asshown in Fig. 1(c). Specifically, in the GTA→Cityscapes +BDD100k + Mapillary setting, we observed approximately+4% significant improvement in mIoU, particularly the im-provement in extreme scenes is close to +5%. Our maincontributions are summarized as follows:• We propose a stronger DepthForge learning framework tofine-tune VFMs combined with visual and depth cues fordomain-generalized semantic segmentation.• A depth-awareness learnable tokens are introduced tofocus on spatial relationship that acquires steadier andmore robust visual-spatial attention.This strategy en-ables DepthForge to enhance the discriminability and re-fine features at an instance level within each layer.Learnable Tokens···fvi + fdiDepth-aware Learnable Tokens···fvi+ fdiDepth-aware Learnable Tokens···fvifdiConfig. 1Config. 3Config. 2Config. 1Config. 3Config. 2(a)(b)StepLossFigure 2.

Related Work2.1. Domain Generalized Semantic SegmentationDomain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS)aims to enhance the generalization capability of segmen-tation models to unseen domains.Recent methods pri-marily focus on reducing feature distribution discrepanciesacross domains and learning more domain-invariant repre-sentations. Adversarial training [52], meta-learning [4, 40],and self-supervised learning [17, 55] have been extensivelyexplored to improve generalization performance.How-ever, these methods often rely on constructing cross-domaincontrastive constraints or employing sophisticated trainingstrategies, limiting their generalization improvements andcomplicating the training process. The emergence of VisionFoundation Models (VFMs), trained via large-scale image-text [35] or image-image contrastive learning [29], hasopened a promising avenue for DGSS. VFMs capture uni-versal and rich visual representations beneficial for reduc-ing domain biases. Recent approach [2, 43] leverages pre-trained VFMs by employing their frozen features as power-ful generalized backbones to extract and refine learnable to-kens, leading to significant improvements in model perfor-mance. Nevertheless, current DGSS approaches predomi-nantly utilize RGB-only data, leaving the models suscep-tible to variations in lighting, texture, and spatial arrange-ments across different domains, thus constraining their fullpotential for generalization.2.2. RGB-D SegmentationCombining RGB with depth information has shown sub-stantial benefits across various visual tasks [6, 8, 16, 38].In object detection, RGB-D effectively mitigates limitationsinherent to RGB data under complex scenes by providing2Layer L1Layer L2Layer LN-1Layer LNDepth RefinementDecoderForzen VFM Backbone·····Layer L1Layer L2Layer LN-1Layer LNForzen Depth VFM BackboneTunable DepthForgeDepth-aware Learnable Tokens···MLPDepth AwarenessDepth-aware Learnable Tokens···Layer Ln-1Layer LnAttention OptimizationLayer Ln+1Layer Ln-1Layer Ln-1Layer Ln+1SegmentHeadDepth Refinement Decoder·········MLPMLPDecoderLayer L1~NLayer L1~NMLP···SigmoidAdditionDot Product···············Figure 3.

In our tunable DepthForge, We first design a DepthAwareness module that intergrates visual and depth cues into learnable tokens. Next, we propose an Attention Optimization module tostrengthen the discriminability of instances across different spatial locations. Finally, multi-scale features are fused in Depth refinementDecoder to adapt to various scales and spatial connexts. Our DepthForge establishes direct connections to different instances in real-world locations, facilitating both feature refinement and improved discriminability.robust geometric and spatial cues, thereby enhancing local-ization accuracy and model robustness [42, 58]. In seman-tic segmentation, depth information assists models in cap-turing spatial structures and geometric contours of objects,alleviating issues related to imprecise object boundary de-lineation. Particularly in scenarios with blurred boundaries,insufficient illumination, or texture scarcity, the incorpora-tion of depth information substantially improves segmenta-tion accuracy and stability [13, 47, 53, 59]. Recent studieshave further indicated that even in domain generalizationtasks, integrating RGB and depth features consistently im-proves the model’s generalization performance on unseendomains [18, 26, 37, 54]. Therefore, exploring the inte-gration of depth information to address the limitations ofRGB-only approaches represents a promising and essentialresearch direction within DGSS.3. PreliminaryTo achieve better generalization performance, existingapproaches opt to fine-tune VFMs in a parameter-efficientmanner. One mainstream idea is to refine and propagate fea-tures from frozen VFM layers to subsequent ones. Specif-ically, given a pre-trained VFM composed of N sequentiallayers {L1, L2, ..., LN}, where each layer is associated witha weight matrix Wi ∈Rc×c and the frozen output featuresof each layer are denoted as fi for i = 1, 2, ..., N. If wehave a learnable weight matrix as ∆Wi ∈Rc×c, the featurepropagation from layer Li to Li+1 is then formulated as: f_ { i+1} = W_{i}f_{i} + \Delta W_{i}f_{i}. (1)Recent REIN transfers the learnable matrix ∆Wi into alearnable token Ti: f_ { i+1} = W_{i}f_{i} + \epsilon (T_{i}(W_{i}f_{i})), (2)where ϵ(·) denotes the MLP function, and Ti ∈Rm×c witha tokn length m. REIN enables each token to connect betterwith instances in an image. However, we observe that sincethe updated and frozen features are limited to remain sim-ilar, this correlation is fragile and the capacity for featurerefinement is limited.This prompted us to explore what kind of informationcould improve discrimination in instances and refine thefeature representations. Drawing inspiration from multi-modal learning, we observe that depth features provide aspatial relationship bias for corresponding pixels in visualfeatures, thereby compensating for the loss of crucial vi-sual cues in DGSS. We assume that incorporating a pre-trained depth VFM into the pre-trained VFMs will alleviateattention bias and significantly enhance scene understand-ing, particularly under extreme conditions.We use the frozen features f vi from VFM for visual em-bedding, and the frozen festures f di from depth VFM fordepth embedding. A straightforward thought might simplyadd f di to f vi , or incorporate f di into the leanable token Ti,3MethodProc. & Year Snow Night Fog RainResNet based:IBN [30]ECCV201849.621.263.8 50.4Itenorm [20]CVPR201949.923.863.3 50.1IW [31]CVPR201947.621.862.4 52.4RobustNet [9]CVPR202149.824.364.3 56.0WildNet [25]CVPR202228.412.741.2 34.2Transformer based:HGFormer [12]CVPR202368.652.769.9 72.0CMFormer [3]AAAI202464.333.777.8 67.6VFM based:REIN [43]CVPR202470.655.979.5 72.5FADA [2]NeurIPS202473.557.480.2 75.0DepthForge(Ours)-75.460.481.2 75.4Table 1.

(%)However, these methods lack flexibility and introduce sig-nificant inter-layer feature differences that prevent conver-gence, as shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, we propose Depth-Forge to adaptively fuse visual and depth cues, denoted as: f_ { i +1 } = W^{v}_{i }f _ {i } + \varep si l on (\epsilon ^{v}(T_{i}(W^{v}_{i}f^{v}_{i})) + \epsilon ^{d}(T_{i}(W^{d}_{i}f^{d}_{i}))), (3)where W vi and W di represent the weight matrix from VFMsand depth VFM, respectively. ε denote the adaptation ofthe visual and depth signals. This approach allows us tomore effectively utilize the powerful capacities of multi-modal VFMs to forge robust refined features and instancediscriminability.More importantly, the depth VFM itself possesses stronggeneralization capabilities, allowing domain adaptationwithout fine-tuning. A pre-trained VFM applies the same.Therefore, the overall optimation objective still focuses onthe segmentation head H with parameter θh and our Depth-Forge with parameter θD: \ arg \underset {\theta _{D}, \theta _{ h}} {min} \sum _{i=1}^{N} \mathcal {L}oss(\mathcal {H_{\theta _{h}}}(\mathcal {F}_{\Theta ^{v}, \Theta ^{d}, \theta _{D}}(x_{i})), y_{i}), (4)where xi and yi denote the input image and its correspond-ing ground truth, respectively, and N signifies the totalnumber of images.

Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scalecharacter dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematicallyorganized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combina-tions) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization ofidentity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways.Qualitative experiments demonstrate InstantCharacter’s advanced capabilities ingenerating high-fidelity, text-controllable, and character-consistent images, set-ting a new benchmark for character-driven image generation. Our source code isavailable at https://github.com/Tencent/InstantCharacter.1IntroductionCharacter-driven image generation aims to create images that incorporates the user-defined characterimage and text prompts, playing a crucial role in various creative endeavors such as storytellingillustration, comic creation, game character design, and more. These capabilities enable a widerange of applications in entertainment, film production, e-commerce advertising, and beyond. Recentadvancements in generative diffusion transformers have demonstrated unprecedented capabilitiesin synthesizing high-fidelity images from textual descriptions. Nevertheless, the potential of thesestate-of-the-art models for personalized image generation remains underexplored, especially in thecontext of creating character-driven visual narratives that embody human-like attributes.Current methodologies for generating consistent images of specified subjects primarily rely on tuning-or adapter-based approaches. Adapter-based approaches [9, 24, 13] extract visual features througha subject encoder and integrate them into the image noise space via cross-attention mechanism.While these techniques achieve certain subject consistency and text controllability on UNet-basedmodels, they struggle to personalize open-domain characters with diverse identities, poses, and styles.Although effective for customizing open-domain characters, tuning-based approaches [18] requirePreprint. Under review.arXiv:2504.12395v1 [cs.CV] 16 Apr 2025Figure 1: Open-domain character personalization with InstantCharacter.fine-tuning the model to reconstruct subject images, leading to long customization time and limitedtext controllability. Moreover, inference-time fine-tuning becomes computationally prohibitive formodern diffusion transformers with billions of parameters.Compared to traditional UNet-based architectures [17, 15], modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) [2,8] exhibit powerful generative priors and offer unparalleled flexibility and capacity. However, fullyunleashing their potential is non-trivial, as it requires a robust adapter network compatible withthe framework to ensure alignment between character-specific features and vast generative latentspace. In addition, training such an adapter necessitates adequate training data and effective trainingstrategies. We observe that directly applying traditional adapters to large-scale DiTs often fails, asthese adapters are primarily designed for UNet architectures and cannot scale effectively to modelswith billions of parameters, such as Flux [8] with 12 billion parameters.To achieve generalized character personalization without compromising inference-time efficiencyand textual editability, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable diffusion transformer frameworkdesigned for character-driven image generation. InstantCharacter offers three key advantages:1.Generalizability. It can flexibly personalize any character with different appearances, actions,and styles, ranging from photorealistic portraits to anime game assets. 2.Scalability. We developa scalable adapter that can effectively integrate multi-stage character features and interact withthe latent space of modern DiTs. 3.Versatility. To enable efficient training, we collect a versatile10-million-level character dataset, which contains paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. Accordingly, we propose an efficient three-stage training strategy toaccommodate heterogeneous data samples. Specifically, we decouple character consistency (unpaireddata), textual controllability (paired data), and image fidelity (high-resolution data) to prevent mutualinterference between high-fidelity identity maintenance and prompt-guided character manipulations.We implement InstantCharacter based on the powerful FLUX1.0-dev model. Qualitative comparisonswith previous work demonstrate InstantCharacter’s advanced capabilities in generating high-fidelity,text-controllable, and character-consistent images.2Related WorkT2I diffusion models. Recent advances [2, 15, 17] in text-to-image generation have witnesseda paradigm shift from traditional U-Net architectures [17] to more powerful diffusion transform-2ers [2] (DiTs). While early diffusion models such as stable diffusion (SD) demonstrated remarkableimage synthesis capabilities, modern DiT-based systems like SD3 [2] and FLUX.1 [8] have setnew benchmarks in generation quality through their transformer-based architectures and advancedtechniques like rectified flows. This architectural evolution presents both opportunities and challengesfor character-centric applications, while DiTs offer superior generation capacity, their adaptationfor identity-preserving tasks remains largely underexplored. Our work bridges this critical gap bydeveloping the first DiT-based framework specifically optimized for character customization.Personalized character generation. Recent advances in personalized image generation haveevolved from tuning-based to adapter-based approaches. Early methods [18, 1, 3, 7, 4] relied onfine-tuning the entire diffusion model for each new subject, which was computationally expensiveand suffered from poor generalization due to limited training data. To address these issues, recentworks [24, 9, 13, 22, 10, 5, 21, 12] introduced adapter-based techniques that avoid test-time fine-tuning. For instance, IP-Adapter [24] employs a clip image encoder to extract subject features andinjects them into a frozen diffusion model via cross-attention, enabling efficient personalization.However, these adapter-based methods are predominantly built upon UNet-based architectures withrestricted capacity, causing them to struggle in effectively scaling and often produce low-fidelityoutputs and limited generalization across diverse character poses and styles. In contrast, our workintroduces a scalable diffusion transformer framework that overcomes these limitations, achievingsuperior open-domain generalizability, image fidelity, and text controllability compared to UNet-basedalternatives.3MethodsModern DiTs [2, 8] have demonstrated unprecedented fidelity and capacity compared to traditionalUNet-based architectures, offering a more robust foundation for generation and editing tasks. Build-ing upon these advances, we present InstantCharacter, a novel framework that extends DiT forgeneralizable and high-fidelity character-driven image generation. As illustrated in Figure 2, In-stantCharacter’s architecture centers around two key innovations. First, a scalable adapter moduleis developed to effectively parse character features and seamlessly interact with DiTs latent space.Second, a progressive three-stage training strategy is designed to adapt to our collected versatiledataset, enabling separate training for character consistency and text editability. By synergisticallycombining flexible adapter design and phased learning strategy, we enhance the general charactercustomization capability while maximizing the preservation of the generative priors of the baseDiT model. In the following sections, we will detail the adapter’s architecture and elaborate on ourprogressive training strategy.Figure 2: Our framework seamlessly integrates a scalable adapter with a pretrained DiT model.The adapter consists of multiple stacked transformer encoders that incrementally refine characterrepresentations, enabling effective interaction with the latent space of the DiT. The training processemploys a three-stage progressive strategy, beginning with unpaired low-resolution pretraining andculminating in paired high-resolution fine-tuning.33.1The scalable adapter designTraditional customization adapters, such as IPAdapter [24] or ReferenceNet [19], often fail in theDiT architectures because they are specifically designed for U-Net based models and lack scalability.To better adapt to DiT models, we propose a scalable full-transformer adapter that serves as a cruciallink between conditioning character images and the latent generative space of the base model. Thefull-transformer structure enables scalability by increasing layer depth and hidden feature sizes. Thisadapter consists of three encoder blocks, as detailed below.General vision encoders. We first leverage pre-trained large vision foundation encoders to ex-tract general character features, benefiting from their open-domain recognition abilities. Previousmethods [24, 10] typically rely on CLIP [16] for its aligned visual and textual features. However,while CLIP is capable of capturing abstract semantic information, it tends to lose detailed textureinformation, which is crucial for maintaining character consistency. To this end, we replace CLIPwith SigLIP [25], which excels in capturing finer-grained character information. In addition, weintroduce DINOv2 [14] as another image encoder to enhance the robustness of features, reducing theloss of features caused by background or other interfering factors. Finally, we integrate DINOv2 andSigLIP features via channel-wise concatenation, resulting in a more comprehensive representation ofopen-domain characters.Intermediate encoders. Since SigLIP and DINOv2 are pre-trained and inferred at a relatively lowresolution of 384, the raw output of general vision encoders may lose fine-grained features whenprocessing high-resolution character images. To mitigate this issue, we employ a dual-stream featurefusion strategy to explore low-level and region-level features, respectively. First, we directly extractlow-level features from the shallow layers of the general vision encoders, capturing details that areoften lost in higher layers. Second, we divide the reference image into multiple non-overlappingpatches and feed each patch into the vision encoder to obtain region-level features. Then these twodistinct feature streams undergo hierarchical integration through dedicated intermediate transformerencoders. Specifically, each feature pathway is independently processed by a separate transformerencoder to integrate with high-level semantic features. Subsequently, the refined feature embeddingsfrom both pathways are concatenated along the token dimension, establishing a comprehensive fusedrepresentation that captures multi-level complementary information.Projection head. Finally, the refined character features are projected into the denoising space viaa projection head and interact with the latent noise. We implement this through a timestep-awareQ-former [24] that processes intermediate encoder outputs as key-value pairs while dynamicallyupdating a set of learnable queries through attention mechanisms. The transformed query featuresare then injected into the denoising space via learnable cross-attention layers. Finally, the adapterenables faithful identity preservation and flexible adaptation to complex text-driven modifications.3.2Training strategiesTo enable effective training of the framework, we first curate a high-quality dataset of 10 millionimages containing diverse full-body humans/characters, including both unpaired images for learningrobust character consistency and paired sets for achieving precise text-to-image alignment.Our training regimen is meticulously designed to optimize character consistency, text controllability,and visual fidelity. To achieve character consistency, we first train with unpaired data, where thecharacter image is incorporated as reference guidance to reconstruct itself and preserve structuralconsistency. We discovered that using a resolution of 512 is significantly more efficient than 1024.In the second phase, we continue training at a low resolution (512) but switch to paired trainingdata. By taking the character image as input, we aim to generate images of the character in differentactions, poses, and styles within a new scene based on a given textual description. This trainingstage efficiently eliminates the copy-paste effect and enhances text controllability, ensuring that thegenerated images accurately follow the textual condition.The final phase involves high-resolution joint training using both paired and non-paired images. Wefound that a limited number of high-resolution training iterations can substantially improve the visualquality and texture of the images. This stage leverages high-quality images to achieve high-fidelityand textually controlled character images.44ExperimentsFigure 3: Qualitative comparison on character personalization. Our method generally demonstratesthe best image fidelity and character consistency while maintaining the desirable textual controllabil-ity.Qualitative results. We conduct qualitative comparisons against state-of-the-art FLUX-basedapproaches: OminiControl [20], EasyControl [26], ACE+ [11], and UNO [23]; and the large multi-modality model GPT4o [6]. For evaluation, we collect a set of open-domain character images notpresent in the training data. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, our analysis demonstrates that whileexisting methods show limitations: OminiControl and EasyControl fail to preserve character identityfeatures, and ACE++ only maintains partial features in simple scenarios while struggling with action-oriented prompts. UNO overly preserves consistency, which reduces the editability of actions andbackgrounds. It is notable that our method achieves comparable results with GPT4o, which is thecurrent SoTA method but it is not open source. In contrast, InstantCharacter consistently performs thebest. Specifically, InstantCharacter achieves superior character detail preservation with high fidelitywhile maintaining precise text controllability, even for complex action prompts. These qualitativeadvantages are further supported by quantitative measurements shown in Fig. 6.Personalization with different styles. Our framework can also achieve flexible character stylizationby introducing different style loras. As shown in Fig. 5, our method can switch between Ghibli and5Figure 4: Qualitative comparison on character personalization.

In Proceedings of the 48th International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR’25), July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 12 pages.https://doi.org/10.1145/3726302.37303051IntroductionLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformativetools in the information retrieval (IR) domain [91], enabling signifi-cant advancements in tasks such as document ranking [62, 74, 88],query generation [73, 81], and system evaluation [3, 63, 68]. Theirability to process and generate human-like text has enhanced effi-ciency and scalability across tasks that were traditionally human-led. Notably, LLMs have shown substantial promise in automatingthe evaluation of IR systems by generating relevance judgmentsthat closely align with human assessments [47, 75, 92].Under the traditional IR paradigm, search engines respond touser queries with ranked lists of documents from a pre-definedcorpus. The effectiveness of a search engine’s ranking is evaluatedbased on its ability to place relevant documents higher on a list[57, 58]. Historically, this evaluation methodology relied on humanannotators to label query-document pairs for relevance, quality, andother attributes. Unfortunately, this approach is resource-intensiveand can suffer from issues of incomplete labeling, inconsistenciesamong annotators, and high costs, particularly in academic set-ting [70, 76, 90]. Experimental initiatives such as TREC, NTCIR,CLEF, and FIRE have aimed to address these issues by creatingreusable test collections with predefined relevance labels, allowingconsistent comparison of retrieval systems [2, 39, 43].Recent advancements in LLMs have shifted this paradigm byoffering a scalable and cost-effective alternative for generating rel-evance labels [9, 54, 61, 77]. Studies have shown that LLM-basedrelevance assessments can achieve accuracy comparable to, or evenexceeding, that of human annotators, as demonstrated in real-worldsystems like Bing [75]. These models not only reduce labeling costsbut also address ""assessment holes"" where unjudged results in tra-ditional test collections lead to performance underestimation ofnewer models [13]. However, the growing reliance on LLMs forevaluation introduces challenges of consistency, alignment, andtransparency [7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15]. As Faggioli et al. [35] note, evalu-ations in IR must remain grounded in human judgment to maintaintrust and reliability.In fact, despite the success of LLM relevance assessments, sev-eral papers have raised concerns about their robustness and theirarXiv:2504.12558v1 [cs.IR] 17 Apr 2025SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, ItalyTrovato et al.alignment with human preferences. Alaofi et al. [4] report a “ten-dency for many LLMs to label passages that include the originalquery terms as relevant.” They demonstrate that merely injectingquery terms into a document or even adding an explicit statementthat the document is relevant can influence an LLM to label thedocument as relevant. Clarke and Dietz [26] report an experimentdemonstrating that LLM assessment can be biased toward LLM-based re-ranking methods. The authors of the UMBRELA assessmenttool [77, 78]–which was used for automated evaluation of TRECRAG 2024– found that when asking LLMs and humans to rate rele-vance using graded values, humans tend to apply stricter criteria.For instance, when analyzing three years of TREC Deep Learn-ing track data (2019–2021) using UMBRELA and comparing it tohuman judgments, it was observed that on average humans la-beled over 13% more documents as non-relevant (14,961 vs. 17,376).Conversely, LLMs were more lenient in judging relevance, labelingover 26% more documents as perfectly relevant (3,063 vs. 2,429).This observation suggests that LLMs may interpret relevance moreliberally than humans. Differences between human and LLM-basedrelevance judgments are also reflected in statistical measures ofalignment with human labels and agreement with system rankings[31, 35, 64, 78]. To the best of our knowledge, the extent to whichthese discrepancies impact the interpretation of evaluation resultsacross different LLM-based evaluation methods has not been exten-sively studied. This gap may be due to the lack of available dataand the limited diversity of LLM-based relevance judgments for agiven dataset.Given the flexibility of LLMs in language processing tasks, weare no longer constrained to standard methods for relevance assess-ment. Methods that once required substantial human labor — whichmay have impeded their adoption – now become feasible due tothe reduced costs associated with LLM-based assessment. How-ever, there has been limited exploration of alternative methods ora comprehensive comparative studies of methods beyond gradedrelevance assessment.With the goal of placing different relevance judgements on a“level playing field” this paper compares various LLM-based rele-vance assessment methods, including:(1) traditional relevance judgments in both Binary [35] andgraded forms (UMBRELA) [78](2) two nugget-based methods – one document-agnostic (Exam)[36, 69] and one document-dependent (AutoNuggetizer) [61](3) a pairwise preference-based relevance judgment method.To minimize the influence of prompt engineering and enhancereproducibility, as much as possible we rely on established tools andprompts. Our experiments are conducted using both a commercialLLM (ChatGPT-4o) and an open-source LLM (Llama 3.2B). Due tospace limitations, we do not present or analyze the llama resultsin this paper, but we include all of the data, results and analysis inour GitHub repository.Our of our objectives in this paper is to help comparing differentLLM-based relevance judgment systems on a level playing field byconsidering two factors:(1) Alignment with human labels: The degree to which LLM-generated relevance judgments reflect the document orderingimputed by human labels.(2) Agreement with system rankings: The consistency betweensystem rankings produced using LLM-generated labels andthose derived from human labels.As observed earlier, LLMs can be more lenient in judging relevance.The first factor (“alignment”) allows us to side-step this issue byfocusing on the order in which documents are placed by the variousassessment methods. For example, if human assessment assigns ahigher grade to one document vs. another, we expect LLM-based as-sessment to provide a consistent ordering, even if the LLM assignsdifferent grades. Although the various assessment methods expressrelevance in different ways, e.g., grades vs. nuggets, alignment withhuman labels allows us to make a direct comparison between dif-ferent relevance judgment methods. Full details are provided inSection 4.1. For similar reasons, for the second factor we employ anflexible evaluation measure “compatibility” that naturally adapts toany relevance assessment method [27]. Compatibility essentiallycompares a given ranking to the ideal permutation of judgments.Since it operates on relative relevance rather than absolute values, itenables meaningful comparisons between different relevance judg-ment approaches. Further details on how compatibility is computedand how we apply it in our study are provided in Section 4.2.We report experiments evaluating the various assessment meth-ods in terms of these two factors. Our study employs three yearsof TREC test collections (2019, 2020, and 2021) [32–34], which arebased on two different corpora: MS MARCO v1 and v2 [56]. Wechoose these test collections since they have been employed inprevious comparisons of LLM-based assessments [35, 78] allowingour results to be compared with previous results. In addition, as atest of generalizability, we report experiments on the ANTIQUEdataset [40], an open-domain question-answering dataset derivedfrom Yahoo Answers. All data and code are publicly available in ourGitHub repository. As new large language models appear and as-sessment methods are proposed, these judgments provide a baselinefor evaluation.This paper makes several key contributions to the study of LLM-based relevance assessment:(1) We curated a comprehensive resource of relevance judgmentsgenerated using five distinct methods—binary relevance, gradedrelevance, pairwise preference, document-agnostic nugget-basedevaluation, and document-dependent nugget-based evaluationacross two large language models (GPT-4o and Llama 3.2B) andfour benchmark datasets (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, TRECDL 2021, and ANTIQUE). All relevance judgments, along withcode and experimental results, are publicly available on ourGitHub repository1.(2) We systematically compare LLM-generated relevance judgmentswith human labels, ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation byplacing them on the same playing field.(3) We introduce a method for assessing how well different rele-vance judgment approaches align with system rankings, pro-viding a standardized framework for cross-method comparison.1https://github.com/Narabzad/llm-relevance-judgement-comparisonBenchmarking LLM-based Relevance Judgment MethodsSIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy2BackgroundThe continuing rapid advancement of AI technologies necessitatesthe ongoing development of evaluation benchmarks [38, 89]. Tradi-tional benchmarks often become inadequate as models achieve highperformance on them [53]. Additionally, the increasing speed ofbenchmarking and the emergence of novel tasks make relying solelyon human annotation increasingly challenging [19]. Automatedevaluation methods have thus gained popularity, accelerating theevaluation process and facilitating tool development [11, 20].While automated evaluation metrics offer scalability, humanjudgment remains essential for capturing subjective quality mea-sures and ensuring alignment with human labels [5, 82]. To enableeffective hybrid evaluations, automated methods, particularly thosebased on LLMs, must be aligned with human judgment [42]. Further-more, conclusions drawn from annotations should be interpretablefor system comparison. For instance, in LLM-based relevance judg-ments for information retrieval evaluation, it is crucial to under-stand how these judgments influence system rankings and measuresystem effectiveness. LLM-based relevance assessment is not onlyvaluable for assessing IR systems but may also play a crucial role inevaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, whereanswers are not necessarily derived from a fixed collection [87].There have long been attempts to automate the process of rele-vance judgment [49, 50, 66, 72]. However, with the emergence ofLLMs, automated relevance judgment has gained significant atten-tion, with examples like the use of automated evaluation methodsin TREC RAG 2024 track [61, 77]. LLM-based relevance judgmentwas pioneered by Faggioli et al. [35], where the authors discussedthe potential for various levels of collaboration between humansand machines in evaluating IR systems. Thomas et al. [75] illustratethat LLM-based relevance judgments have on-par quality as humanannotators and they could even be deployed at an industrial scale,as implemented at Microsoft Bing. While these studies reporteda high rank-based Kendall’s 𝜏correlation (typically above 0.85)between human and LLM-graded judgments [1, 35, 48, 75], theyalso highlight a lack of calibration between automated relevancejudgments and human assessments, with LLM-based assessmentoften assigning higher grades on average [78].Alignment with Human labels. Discrepancies exist between hu-man and LLM-based relevance judgments. For instance, humans arefound to be generally more strict in defining relevance compared toLLMs [55, 77, 78]. These differences are also reflected in statisticalagreement measures, such as Cohen’s Kappa (𝜅). When comparinghuman and LLM assessments, Faggioli et al. [35] report binary 𝜅values between 0.07 and 0.49 (slight to moderate). Upadhyay et al.[78] report 𝜅agreement for binary and graded relevance judgmentbetween LLM and human annotations. For binary, they report 𝜅between 0.4 and 0.5 (moderate) and for four-point values between0.3 and 0.4. Rahmani et al. [64] report an experiment in whichseven independent research groups applied their prompts and LLM-based assessment tools to label a common set of query/documentpairs on a four-point graded relevance scale. No group achieved a𝜅over 0.45, when compared with human labels, with all but onesubmission having 𝜅values below 0.4. As a basis for comparison,human-human 𝜅values can be above 0.5 on binary assessment [31].Agreement with System Rankings. In addition to a direct com-parison of relevance labels, information retrieval researchers oftenevaluate relevance grading methods and evaluation metrics by com-puting Kendall’s Tau (𝜏) correlation between system rankings [79].Kendall’s 𝜏measures the rank correl","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in bothacademic and industry settings to automate the evaluation of in-formation seeking systems, particularly by generating graded rel-evance judgments.

The union of these genesforms the “informative gene set”. Conversely, we construct the “background gene set” by takingthe complement of the top 100 genes within each factor and computing their intersection acrossall factors. To compare these gene sets, we examine their overlap with genes in the OncoSearchdatabase [35], which catalogs gene-cancer relationships by querying Medline abstracts. We findthat the informative gene set exhibits greater overlap with OncoSearch-recorded genes than thebackground gene set (Table 3), both in absolute numbers and relative proportions. This result sup-ports the hypothesis that genes with higher loadings in GPCCA’s latent factors are more closelylinked to cancer progression. Additionally, we compare these gene sets with those in the OncoDBdatabase [36], which catalogs differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples.Across all cancer types, the informative gene set consistently exhibits smaller P-values than thebackground gene set (Supplementary Figure S13), which further confirms that the latent factorsidentified by GPCCA capture biologically relevant gene markers for different cancer types.4DiscussionIn this article, we introduce the GPCCA model for joint dimensionality reduction and multi-modal data integration. GPCCA learns low-dimensional embeddings of observations while pre-serving both shared and complementary information across modalities, leveraging cross-modalrelationships to enhance downstream clustering analysis. It extends the classical CCA method inseveral ways. First, it formulates data integration within a probabilistic framework. Second, it gen-eralizes to more than two modalities, enabling seamless integration of diverse data types. Third, it22treats missing values as latent variables within the model, eliminating the need for separate impu-tation as a preprocessing step. We evaluate GPCCA through comprehensive simulation studiesand two real-world applications. In the analysis of multi-view image data of handwritten digits,evaluations based on ground truth labels demonstrate GPCCA’s superior performance comparedto alternative methods. In the application to multi-omics TCGA data, although ground truth subjectsubgroups are not available, our analysis shows that GPCCA effectively identifies patient groupswith differential survival rates across cancer types. Furthermore, the learned latent factors revealinformative gene features closely associated with cancer, highlighting the model’s potential forbiomedical discovery.The development of GPCCA is motivated in part by the prevalence of missing values in real-world multi-modal data. Estimation of GPCCA is achieved through the proposed EM algorithm,which assumes data are missing at random (MAR). However, recognizing that real data often ex-hibit missing not at random (MNAR) patterns, we assess GPCCA’s robustness when the MARassumption is violated. In both simulations (Case C) and real data applications, we specifically ex-amine modality-wise missingness, a common scenario in biological and biomedical studies wherethe presence of a modality depends on latent, unobserved factors. Across multiple datasets withMNAR, GPCCA consistently demonstrates strong performance in identifying meaningful clustersbased on the learned latent factors, suggesting its ability to handle complex missing patterns.Despite the advantages discussed, we acknowledge several limitations of the current work thatpoint to potential directions for future improvements and extensions. First, the computational costof the EM algorithm increases with data dimensions, primarily due to the matrix inversion requiredfor the error covariance matrix. While we employ block-wise inversion and other numerical tech-niques to mitigate this issue, runtime remains a challenge on high-dimensional data with missingvalues. To address this, we suggest that users consider a filtering step for modalities with toomany features (e.g., the DNA methylation modality in TCGA data) by selecting the most variablefeatures for integration. Furthermore, to enhance computational efficiency, we could explore incor-porating low-rank approximations of the covariance matrix as an alternative approach. Second, inour current applications of GPCCA to real data, we set the ridge regularization parameter λ to 0.5,which has demonstrated good performance across a variety of simulation settings. However, insome applications, it may be beneficial to adaptively select λ using grid search or other methods.Identifying a robust measure for this selection via cross-validation or other model selection tech-niques remains an important avenue for future work. Third, GPCCA assumes that data followsa multivariate normal distribution. Although many datasets can be well-approximated by normaldistributions after appropriate transformations, and our simulations have demonstrated GPCCA’srobustness to heavy-tailed data (Case B), this assumption may limit its applicability to data modal-ities that significantly deviate from normality. A promising direction for future work is to extendGPCCA’s probabilistic framework to accommodate non-Gaussian distributions, such as binary orcount data, to enhance its versatility. In summary, while GPCCA demonstrates strong potential,these limitations also present exciting opportunities for further refinement, which could broaden its23applicability and enhance its performance across a wide range of data types and use cases.DeclarationsEthics approval and consent to participateNot applicable.Consent for publicationNot applicable.Availability of data and materialThe GPCCA model has been implemented as an R package, which is freely available from itsGithub repository https://github.com/Kaversoniano/GPCCA.

Downstream TasksIn this work, five downstream tasks are adopted to vali-date the effectiveness and generalization of our proposedCM3AE large model, including Event-/RGB-Event basedhuman action recognition , Event-based object detec-tion , and Event-/RGB-Event based visual object track-ing . A brief introduction to these tasks can be foundin the supplementary materials.• Event-/RGB-Event based Human Action Recogni-tion.This task aims to recognize human actions in inputvideos, such as drinking water, riding a bicycle, and skip-ping rope, using a deep learning network. In this paper,we validate our proposed CM3AE pre-training model un-der two settings: Event-based and RGB-Event based. Forthe Event-based approach, we directly employ the Times-former model. However, unlike single-modal recogni-tion tasks, the RGB-Event based method seeks to fully inte-grate the complementary information from RGB and Eventmodalities for target action recognition. Therefore, we per-form a simple extension of the Timesformer to adapt itto multimodal data input.• Event-based Object Detection.This task aims toleverage the characteristics of the event stream data to ad-dress challenges such as low light conditions, blur andrapid movement in object detection tasks, improving detec-tion performance. In this work, we validate the proposedCM3AE pre-training model based on the VitDet model.• Event-/RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking. Theobjective of this task is to continuously and accurately iden-tify and locate specific targets of interest within a givenvideo sequence. The targets to be tracked are selected in thefirst frame of the input video sequence. In this work, we val-idate the proposed CM3AE pre-training model on both theunimodal tracking algorithm ODTrack based on Eventdata and the multimodal tracking algorithm CEUTrack based on RGB-Event data.4.

Visualization of the experimental results of each downstream task.4.2. Implementation DetailsIn our pre-training phase, the learning rate is set to 0.0002,and the weight decay is 0.04. The AdamW is selectedas the optimizer to train our model. The batch size is 512and the model is trained for a total of 200 epochs on ourdataset. All the experiments are implemented using Pythonbased on the PyTorch . A server with four A800 GPUsis used for the pre-training. About 134 hours are needed forour pre-training phase.During the fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, weconfigured distinct training parameters for different tasks.Specifically, for both Event-based and RGB-Event-basedhuman action recognition tasks, we employed identical pa-rameters: the models were trained for 15 epochs with alearning rate of 0.008 and a batch size of 8. For the Event-based object detection task, the input image size was setto 1024×1024, with training conducted for 15 epochs us-ing a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 8. For theEvent-based object tracking task, the learning rate was setto 0.0001 with a batch size of 16, and the model was trainedfor 50 epochs. For the RGB-Event-based object trackingtask, the pre-trained model was fine-tuned with a learn-ing rate of 0.0001, a batch size of 16, and trained for 100epochs. The parameter settings for downstream tasks werelargely consistent with their corresponding algorithms. Ad-ditionally, the training of Event-based object detection andtracking models was performed on two NVIDIA RTX 4090GPUs, while the RGB-Event-based object tracking modelwas trained and tested on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.All human action recognition tasks were trained and testedon an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.4.3. Comparison on Public BenchmarksIn this experiment, we use five downstream tasks to val-idate our CM3AE pre-trained large model.We com-pare it with our baseline model and other state-of-the-art models, as shown in Table 1.Specifically, we com-pare the model without pre-training (i.e., learning fromscratch), BEiT , DINO , MoCov3 , IBOT ,BEiTv2 , EVA , PIXMIM , and MAE pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, as well as the MAE modeltrained on our integrated pre-training dataset.For the action recognition task, we conduct experimentson the HARDVS dataset. We selected Timesformer asthe baseline method and integrated the pre-trained modelto validate the effectiveness of our approach.When thepre-trained model is not used, the baseline method achievesTop-1 and Top-5 accuracy of 20.23% and 37.74%, respec-tively, in the Event single-modal setting, while in the RGB-Event multimodal setting, the Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy im-prove to 41.63% and 50.66%, respectively. When using theparameters pre-trained by MAE on the ImageNet dataset toinitialize the ViT-base backbone, the recognition accuracyin the Event single-modal setting improves to 49.21% and59.01% for Top-1 and Top-5, respectively, while the RGB-Event multimodal setting achieves 50.23% and 59.65%, re-spectively.

Compared tothe original MAE, our approach achieves superior perfor-mance with only 25% of the training time. This demon-strates that the performance of general pre-trained models islimited in event-camera-based downstream tasks. Notably,when using the pre-training method proposed in this paper,the best performance is achieved across all metrics, withEvent single-modal recognition accuracy reaching 53.18%and 62.88%, and RGB-Event multimodal recognition accu-racy improving to 53.24% and 65.13%. In contrast, existingpre-trained models such as BEiTv2, EVA, and PIXMIM allexhibited lower performance than our model. Similarly, thesame trend was observed in the object detection task. Theseresults and comparisons fully validate the effectiveness ofour proposed model.4.4. Ablation StudyEffects of Multimodal Fusion Reconstruction Module.In this paper, to better model the relationship between RGBand Event modalities, we introduce multimodal fusion re-construction module(MFRM) that reconstructs RGB im-ages using multimodal fusion features. As shown in Ta-ble 2, the introduction of this module during pre-training onthe HARDVS dataset leads to performance improvementsin both Event-based and RGB-Event based human actionrecognition tasks. Specifically, when using only the DMA,the Event-based approach achieves Top1 and Top5 accura-cies of 49.47% and 60.27%, respectively. After further in-tegrating the MFRM into pre-training, the Event-based ap-proach shows improvements of 2.73% in Top1 and 1.78%in Top5 accuracy. The experimental results fully validatethe effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion recon-struction module.Effects of Multimodal Contrastive Learning. The pro-cess of reconstructing the original image in an autoregres-sive manner focuses on modeling local relationships. Toenhance the model’s ability to capture global dependenciesand understand multimodal information, we introduce mul-timodal contrastive learning(MCL) strategy. As shown inTable 2, after introducing MCL based solely on the DMA,the Top1 and Top5 metrics for the Event-based approachincrease to 51.49% and 61.16%, respectively. When theMFRM and MCL are jointly employed, the Top1 and Top5metrics for the Event-based approach further increase to53.18% and 62.88%. Similar results are also obtained forthe RGB-Event-based approach. These results clearly val-idate the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal con-trastive learning.Analysis on Ratio of Masked Tokens. As shown in Ta-ble 3, we conduct pre-training on HARDVS with four dif-ferent ratios of masked tokens to examine their impact,specifically 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.85. The results fromthe Event-based and RGB-Event based human action recog-nition tasks indicate that the best performance is achievedwhen 75% of the input tokens are randomly masked.Analysis on Different Sizes of Training Data in Down-stream Tasks. In this work, to validate the effectivenessof the CM3AE pre-training model on few-shot learningtasks, we conduct experiments using only 10% and 20%of the training data from downstream tasks.As shownin Table 4, for RGB-Event based human action recogni-tion, when training from scratch with only 10% of thedata, the Top1 and Top5 accuracies are 5.63% and 14.52%,respectively.After loading a general MAE pre-trainedmodel, the performance improve to 6.65% and 18.04%, in-dicating that generic pre-trained models struggle with thischallenging task. When using our integrated pre-trainingdataset to train the MAE, the performance increases signif-icantly to 33.31% and 49.01%. Finally, when loading theCM3AE pre-trained model, the optimal results of 43.68%and 57.23% are achieved. These experimental results andcomparisons fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-training model.The impact of the pre-trained fusion module on the per-formance of downstream tasks. In our pre-training frame-work, a fusion module is designed to integrate complemen-tary information between the RGB-Event bimodal modal-ities, helping the model better reconstruct the original im-age. This module is a simple Transformer Block, which canbe easily adapted to existing models for multimodal fea-ture fusion. In Table 5, we conduct experiments on RGB-Event-based action recognition and visual object trackingtasks to evaluate the impact of loading pre-trained param-eters for the fusion module.

These models generate coherent text through inference—the process of producing responses to userqueries—which imposes significant computational demands, particularly on memory and processing resources∗R. Ao and D. Simchi-Levi are with the Institute of Data, System and Society at Massachusetts Institute of Technology;emails: {aorc, dslevi}@mit.edu.†G.

Efficient inference scheduling is essential to optimize resource utilization, reduceoperational costs, and minimize energy consumption (Strubell et al. 2019, Desislavov et al. 2021).Forinstance, systems like ChatGPT incur daily inference costs exceeding $700,000 and contribute to substantialcarbon emissions due to high electricity usage (Patel 2023, Patterson et al. 2021).Effective schedulingstrategies can address these challenges by balancing system throughput and response latency (Wu et al.2022).Understanding the LLM inference process is essential for tackling its associated scheduling challenges. Fig-ure 1 provides a step-by-step illustration of how a query is processed during inference. The process beginswhen a user submits a prompt—e.g., “Is apple a fruit?”—which is then passed through several computationalstages. The inference pipeline consists of two main phases:• Prefill Phase (stage 0): Upon receiving the prompt, the model first tokenizes the input into asequence of discrete units (e.g., “Is”, “apple”, “a”, “fruit”, “?”). These tokens are then embedded andsimultaneously processed in a single forward pass to compute the Key-Value (KV) cache, which storesintermediate representations (i.e., attention keys and values) for each token. These precomputed valuesare critical for enabling efficient reuse during subsequent decoding steps. This phase corresponds toStage 0 in Figure 1, where all prompt tokens are embedded and their KV representations are added tothe cache.• Decode Phase (stages 1 to l′): After the prefill phase, the model enters the decode phase, whereit generates the output one token at a time. At each stage, the model queries the existing KV cacheto compute the next token, appends the new token to the output sequence, and updates the KVcache with its key-value pair. For instance, the model might first generate “Yes” (Stage 1), then “it”(Stage 2), followed by “is” (Stage 3), and finally the “End of Sequence” (EOS) token (Stage 4). Thisprogression is depicted in the lower part of Figure 1. Each token generation step involves both readingfrom and writing to the KV cache, resulting in a memory footprint that grows linearly with the lengthof the generated sequence.Figure 1 also highlights key performance metrics in LLM inference:• Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) measures the latency from user input to the first generated token.• Latency refers to the total time required to complete the generation of all output tokens.• Throughput captures the average number of tokens generated per unit time.This inference structure, particularly the growing memory requirements and sequential decoding pattern,introduces fundamental constraints on scheduling and batching. Efficient scheduling must account for bothprompt heterogeneity and KV cache dynamics in order to optimize latency and resource utilization.The KV cache is essential for efficiency, as it prevents the model from recalculating the attention historyfor each new token. Without it, the computational cost would scale quadratically with the sequence length,making real-time inference infeasible.However, the expanding KV cache poses a significant schedulingchallenge, as the memory footprint grows unpredictably during the decode phase. This variability, combinedwith stochastic prompt arrivals and differing response lengths, complicates resource allocation on hardwarewith finite capacity, such as GPUs. Exceeding memory limits can force the system to offload data to slowerstorage mediums, degrading performance and increasing latency (Tay et al. 2022, Kang et al. 2024, Hooperet al. 2025).Scheduling LLM inference tasks involves grouping prompts into batches processed concurrently on a GPU,combining prefill and decode phases to optimize resource use. This process is constrained by GPU mem-ory limits, as the KV cache grows with each generated token, restricting the number of active prompts.Traditional scheduling methods, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), assume fixed job sizes and known pro-cessing times, making them not suitable for LLM inference where memory demands increase dynamicallyand output lengths are often unknown. For example, consider two prompts: one with a short input buta long, unpredictable output (e.g., “Summarize the history of artificial intelligence”), and another with alonger input but a short output (e.g., “Is 5 a prime number?”). In a traditional setting, SJF would priori-tize the second prompt, expecting its shorter processing time to minimize average wait times. However, in2Figure 1: An example of LLM inference.LLM inference, the first prompt’s decode phase could generate hundreds of tokens, causing its KV cache toballoon over time and occupy significant memory, while the second prompt’s quick decode phase releasesresources almost immediately after a longer prefill.Prioritizing the second prompt might reduce initiallatency, but the first prompt’s prolonged memory usage could block other tasks, leading to GPU under-utilization and reduced throughput. Beyond SJF, other traditional methods like priority scheduling falter asthey prioritize prompts without accounting for the KV cache’s unpredictable growth, potentially exhaustingmemory. While batching remains effective, it requires dynamic adaptation—e.g., adjusting batch sizes basedon current memory usage—to accommodate the KV cache’s expansion, unlike static batching in traditionalsettings. These characteristics—stochastic prompt arrivals, multi-phase processing, and unpredictable re-source needs—render classical operations research approaches inadequate, necessitating tailored schedulingstrategies that account for dynamic memory growth and phase-specific demands.Recent system-level optimizations for LLM inference (Yu et al. 2022, Kwon et al. 2023, Agrawal et al. 2023,Pope et al. 2023, DeepSeek-AI 2024, Patel et al. 2024, Zhong et al. 2024) focus on engineering solutions, suchas batching and memory compression, but lack a rigorous mathematical foundation. In practice, outputlength predictions are imprecise or costly. For example, as shown in Fu et al. (2025), the high-accuracyprediction is sensitive to the bucket size of output lengths for classification. When the output length isunknown, the performance of algorithms may degenerate significantly and performance guarantee obtainedin full knowledge scenario no longer holds (see Proposition 5 in Section 5 as an example).To addressthis problem, we develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark, providinginsights for devising effective scheduling algorithms. Building upon this foundation, we introduce the Waitingfor Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm as a warm-up. This method maintains multiplethresholds to determine the scheduling order of incoming prompts, optimizing resource utilization whenoutput lengths are known at the time of arrival. In practical applications where output lengths are notknown at the time of prompt arrival, we extend our method by introducing the Nested WAIT algorithm.This algorithm constructs a hierarchical framework comprising multiple segments, each defined by distinctthresholds, to effectively manage the random prompt arrivals with unknown output lengths.It is ableto “learn” its behavior as a prompt is processed for more iterations. We show that both algorithms are3asymptotically near-optimal, offering a theoretically grounded solution adaptable to practical settings.1.1Summary of ContributionsThis work contributes to LLM inference scheduling through the following contributions:• Mathematical Model: We develop a multi-stage online scheduling model for LLM inference, ac-counting for queueable prompts under memory constraints (Section 2). To analyze performance andinform practical algorithms, we employ a fluid dynamics approximation based on queueing theory,which serves as both an analytical tool and a performance benchmark (Section 3).• Asymptotically Optimal Algorithms: We develop the WAIT algorithm for known output lengthsas a warm-up (Section 4) and extend it to the Nested WAIT algorithm for unknown output lengths(Section 5), both achieving asymptotic optimality under heavy traffic via novel waiting time andcoupling analyses.• Experimental Validation: We evaluate our algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets, out-performing benchmarks like vLLM (Kwon et al. 2023) and Sarathi (Agrawal et al. 2023), which arewidely recognized high-performance inference engines, in average throughput using Llama2-7B on asingle A100 GPU (Section 6).These contributions bridge operations research and machine learning, addressing analytical challenges instochastic, memory-constrained online scheduling problems.1.2Other Related WorkOnline Scheduling Problem and Queueing System.Classical online scheduling problems focus onoptimally assigning jobs that arrive sequentially, each with varying completion times.In settings withstochastic arrivals, foundational studies such as Devanur and Hayes (2009), Vee et al. (2010), Cole andRoughgarden (2014), Balkanski et al. (2016), Lattanzi et al. (2020) have developed algorithms that learnarrival patterns or distributions to refine scheduling strategies over time. Beyond individual job processing,works like Im and Moseley (2013), Lucier et al. (2013), Liu and Lu (2015), Li et al. (2020) have exploredsimultaneous batching and scheduling, grouping similar jobs to enhance efficiency. Within queueing theory,fluid models serve as first-order approximations of stochastic systems, enabling near-optimal control strategiesMandelbaum et al. (1998), Maglaras (2000), B¨auerle (2002), Liu and Whitt (2011), while heavy-trafficanalysis offers insights into long-term system behavior. However, these traditional approaches fall short inaddressing the unique dynamics of LLM inference, where resource requirements are dynamic due to thegrowing KV cache and the inference process involves distinct prefill and decode phases, unlike the static,single-phase jobs or fixed number phases and resource occupancy in classical scheduling.LLM Inference.Theoretical frameworks for analyzing Large Language Model (LLM) inference are scarce,despite their widespread use, as most prior work targets system-level optimizations rather than the uniquescheduling demands of LLMs.Unlike traditional scheduling, LLM inference involves stochastic arrivals,dynamic memory constraints, and multi-phase processing, complicating analytical efforts. System-level workslike Patel (2023) (“Splitwise”) and Zhong et al. (2024) (“DistServe”) split inference into prompt handlingand pipeline execution, while scheduling methods such as Yu et al. (2022), Agrawal et al. (2023), andAgrawal et al. (2024b) use batching to boost throughput—similar to our approach. Other optimizations,e.g., DeepSeek-AI (2024) with multi-head latent attention and low-rank KV compression, or Fu et al. (2025)with Kendall’s Tau for prioritizing prompts by predicted output lengths, focus on engineering efficiency ratherthan giving theoretical insight. Moreover, when full knowledge of the arriving prompts is not available, itmay lead to significant performance drops (see Proposition 5 in Section 5). Our work tries to tackle thesechallenges by developing a scheduling framework for the realistic case of unknown output lengths, using fluiddynamics approximations and coupling techniques from queueing theory to achieve asymptotic optimality,providing both practical relevance and a robust mathematical foundation. More recently, Li et al. (2025)propose a stochastic processing model for LLM inference based on a linear batch processing time approach,similar to our own. They demonstrate that work-conserving scheduling algorithms—policies designed to4keep resources active whenever tasks are available—achieve optimal throughput for both individual requestsand multi-agent AI workloads. Their framework extends to AI-agent scenarios such as parallel engines andfork-join models, highlighting its flexibility for complex LLM deployments. However, their analysis does notaddress the GPU memory usage of preempted or queued requests, particularly the memory needs of Key-Value caches for tasks awaiting processing. The study also does not explore theoretical aspects of latencymetrics, such as time to first token (TTFT) or end-to-end request latency, which are important for real-timeapplications like interactive dialogue systems.1.3NotationsFor integer n ≥1, we denote [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} as the set of integers from 1 to n. For x ∈R, denote ⌈x⌉as thesmallest integer not smaller than x and ⌊x⌋as the largest integer not greater than x. Denote x+ = max{x, 0}.For set S, denote |S| as its cardinality. For two functions f(T) and g(T), we use f(T) = O(g(T)) if thereexists constant c1 > 0 such that f(T) ≤c1g(T) as T →+∞and f(T) = Ω(g(T)) if there exists constantc2 > 0 such that f(T) ≥c2g(T) as T →+∞.2ModelThis section formalizes the online scheduling problem for Large Language Model (LLM) inference undermemory constraints. Unlike traditional scheduling, this task involves dynamically evolving resource demandsdue to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache and a two-phase (prefill and decode) processing structure. Wefirst introduce the inference process, then describe prompt characteristics, batching rules, system constraints,and performance metrics.2.1Prompts and Inference ProcessWe analyze a system designed to process user queries, referred to as prompts, utilizing a single GraphicsProcessing Unit (GPU) for computation. We focus on maximizing the utilization of single GPU and ouralgorithms can be extended to multi-GPU settings such as those utilizing pipeline parallelism, where eachprompts are processed on different GPU in different layers on LLM model. Additionally, when there is nocommunication cost , our algortihms can generalize naturally to this setting as well.During the inference process, each prompt is divided into discrete units known as tokens during the prefillphase and generates output text through an inference process in the decode phase. A token represents adistinct text element, such as a word or subword, and its processing relies on a memory structure called theK","Large Language Models (LLMs) is indispensable in today’s applications, but their inference proce-dure—generating responses by breaking text into smaller pieces and processing them using a memory-heavy element named Key-Value (KV) cache—requires a lot of computational resources, especially whenmemory is limited.

As a result, LLMs are increas-ingly utilized as real-life medical advisors. A recent survey shows that 32.6% of patientsnow ask LLMs for advice (Aydin et al., 2024), particularly for severe diseases like cancer,where medical resources are limited (Bourgeois et al., 2024; Belong.Life, 2024). However,the real-world patient inquiries differ significantly from traditional medical benchmarks, asthey often contain patient details and sometimes false presuppositions (Kaplan, 1978), i.e.,a misconception that a patient believes to be shared knowledge between themselves andthe clinician when asking a question. To effectively respond to real-world patient inquiries,an LLM should (1) provide factual and helpful answers and (2) identify and clarify anymisconceptions in the patient’s question. Both aspects are essential for ensuring patientsafety and effective medical communication.1arXiv:2504.11373v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025Preprint. Under review.My 70-year-old mom was just diagnosed with lymphoma, but was told by her companions that because it is at an advanced stage, no treatment will be done. What should we expect?I'm really sorry to hear about your mom’s diagnosis. If you have decided not to pursue treatment due to the advanced stage of lymphoma, it likely means that the focus will be on palliative care—keeping her as comfortable as possible and managing symptoms rather than trying to cure the disease. What to expect:1.Symptom Progression …2.Palliative Care & Support …3.Hospice Care (if needed) …●Lymphoma, even in an advanced stage, is curable in some cases. ●The medical advice from companions may not correct. Should see doctor for clinical advice.Figure 1: While current LLM responses can offer helpful medical information, they oftenfail to address false presuppositions in patient questions, which may lead to delays in oravoidance of effective care. LLMs should also provide corrective information (highlightedin red) to help patients recognize and understand their misconceptions.In this study, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to address cancer-related patient questionsthat include medical concerns and potential false presuppositions. We first conduct a studyon CancerCare (CancerCare, 2025) questions, where three hematology oncology physiciansassess responses from both licensed medical social workers and LLMs. The results alignwith the recent evaluation of Reddit medical questions (Ayers et al., 2023), which indicatethat LLMs generally provide accurate and helpful answers, even outperforming humanresponses on average. However, physicians highlight a critical limitation: LLMs often failto clarify patient misunderstandings in certain questions. For instance, in the case ofa patient receiving misleading medical advice from friends (Figure 1), the LLM responseoffers only palliative care options without correcting the false advice. This response caninadvertently reinforce the misconception that no further treatment is available, potentiallyleading the patient to delay or even forgo effective treatment options.To systematically study this issue, we compile a collection of 994 common cancer myths anddevelop an adversarial Cancer-Myth dataset of 585 examples, designed to evaluate LLM andmedical agent performance in handling patient questions with embedded misconceptions.We initialized the adversarial datasets with a few failure examples from our previousCancerCare study. Using an LLM generator, we created patient questions for each myth,integrating false presuppositions with complex patient details to challenge the models. TheLLM responder answers these questions, while a verifier evaluates the response’s ability toaddress false presuppositions effectively. Responses that fail to correct the presuppositionsare added to the adversarial set, while successful ones are placed in the non-adversarialset, for use in subsequent generator prompting rounds. We perform three separate runsover the entire set of myths, each targeting GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet,respectively. The generated questions are categorized into 7 categories, and then finallyreviewed by physicians to ensure their relevance and reliability.Our experimental results reveal a lack of awareness in identifying and correcting patientfalse presuppositions during LLMs’ medical reasoning. No model can fully correct morethan 30% of the false presuppositions. The state-of-the-art medical agentic system MDA-gents (Kim et al., 2024), aggregating information from LLMs role-playing as doctors, isineffective on Cancer-Myth, only correcting 2.2% of the false presuppositions. In particular,models perform worst on the Inevitable Side Effect category, where patient misconceptions,such as assuming a specific treatment will inevitably cause a certain side effect, often gounchallenged by LLMs. These findings underscore the need for improved LLM training and2Preprint.

We confirmed these questions cannot be answered through a simple Googleweb search. We asked three hematology oncology physicians to evaluate these questions,featuring four responses per question: three frontier LLMs GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023),Gemini-1.5-Pro (Google, 2023), LLaMa-3.1-405B (Meta, 2024) and the human responses fromthe website for comparison. The human answers are provided by licensed medical socialworkers, who excel in offering compassionate support and general guidance but may lackthe depth of medical knowledge for complex oncological queries. Their responses average237 words in length. To ensure the physicians remained blind to the response source, weprompted LLMs to provide responses of similar length and removed identifiers such as “Asan AI chatbot”.For each answer, we further manually divided the LLM and human responses into multipleadvice paragraphs, in total 648 paragraphs containing medical advice. We then askedthe physicians to rate the overall response and each segment individually on a scale of1-5. If any segment receives a low rating, experts can specify the reasons using predefined“harmful labels”, and a comment box is provided for more detailed feedback.2.2Evaluation resultsThe average score is 4.13 for GPT-4-Turbo, 3.91 for Gemini-1.5-Pro, 3.57 for LLaMa-3.1-405Band 3.20 for human social workers. Figure 2 provides a detailed paragraph-wise distributionof harmful labels and scores. We find that frontier language models generally performwell in answering real patient questions, although their responses can sometimes be overlygeneric. However, physicians observed that when a patient question contains false presup-positions, language models often answer without correcting these misconceptions (Figure 1).1https://www.cancercare.org/questions3Preprint.

Failing to identify and address false presuppositions can lead tosignificant harm in the medical domain when using LLMs.3Cancer-Myth Dataset CreationWe developed a dataset to systematically evaluate LLM performance in answering questionswith false presuppositions. We collected 994 cancer-related myths and used LLMs togenerate adversarial examples based on these myths. These examples are then verified byhematology oncology physicians to ensure validity.3.1Myth collectionTo construct a comprehensive collection of cancer-related myths, we began by compilinga list of 127 cancer types from the official National Cancer Institute (NCI) website2. Foreach type, we conducted online searches to identify common myths specifically related tothe treatment of that cancer. All information was collected from publicly accessible onlineresources. For example:Cancer: Colorectal cancer.Myth: If I am diagnosed with colorectal cancer, I’ll have a colostomy bag the rest of my life.Fact: Many patients with colorectal cancer do not require a permanent colostomy. Surgicaladvancements often allow for reconnection of the bowel after tumor removal, preservingnormal bowel function.Source: https://healthmatters.nyp.org/seven-myths-about-colorectal-cancer/.We used GPT-4o to organize and summarize a structured set of myths, each paired with thecorresponding cancer type, a factual correction, and a reference source (See Appendix B fordetails). In total, we collected a broad and diverse set of 994 unique cancer-related myths,forming the foundation for subsequent dataset construction and evaluation.2https://www.cancer.gov/types4Preprint.

To begin, we create two small initial sets of valid and invalid questions to serve asexamples for guiding question generation. We selected and edited two representative failureexamples from our preliminary study for the valid set, and manually crafted Ki examples of“invalid” questions for the invalid set (see Appendix B for examples).Then, we generate questions myth-by-myth using an LLM generator. For each myth, weproduce M patient questions with false presuppositions and the corresponding medicalinformation needed to address them. We prompt the generator with Kh hard examples fromthe valid set Svalid, and Ke easy examples plus Ki invalid examples from the invalid setSinvalid, as in-context examples. While myths provide the basis for these questions, the LLMcreatively includes diverse patient details to enhance complexity. As a result, the medicalinformation generated may go beyond the ”Fact” field from the collected myth data.Next, an LLM responder attempts to answer the generated patient questions. Following theresponse, an LLM verifier assesses whether the answers successfully identify and addressthe false presuppositions. The scoring system is as follows:• Score -1: The answer fails to recognize or acknowledge false presuppositions in thequestions;• Score 0: The answer appears aware of false presuppositions but often struggles toidentify them clearly, or does not fully address them with the correct information;• Score 1: The answer accurately addresses the false presuppositions, providingcomprehensive responses that clarify misunderstandings or question the presuppo-sitions.Hard examples receiving a score of -1 are added to the valid set, while easy examples scoring1 are added to the invalid set.We set M = 3, Kh = min(6, |Svalid|), Ke = min(2, |Sinvalid|), Ki = 4, and use GPT-4o as theLLM verifier. To ensure the dataset is not adversarial to just one model (Panickssery et al.,2024), we perform three separate runs over the entire set of myths, each targeting GPT-4o,Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet as both generators and responders, respectively.5Preprint.

Examples not fitting thesecategories are classified as Others.We prompted GPT-4o to categorize each example, achieving an agreement rate of ∼90%on the manually annotated subset. Therefore, GPT-4o is used to categorize the remainingexamples. Figure 4 lists the questions and the corresponding information to correct the falsepresuppositions","Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs)as a new form of internet search for medical information, making it criti-cal to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized ques-tions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams orconsumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patientquestions with detailed clinical contexts. In this paper, we first evaluateLLMs on cancer-related questions drawn from real patients, reviewed bythree hematology oncology physicians. While responses are generally ac-curate, with GPT-4-Turbo scoring 4.13 out of 5, the models frequently failto recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions—posing risksto safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically,we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, nofrontier LLM—including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet—corrects these false presuppositions more than 30% of the time. Even"

A.10 clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating GDFusion, which consistently improves the performance ofbaseline models across RayIoU metrics, as indicated by the red arrows marking relative improvements. These findings under-score the effectiveness of GDFusion in leveraging valuable information embedded within temporal cues, thereby enhancingboth the geometric coherence and semantic precision of reconstructed scenes. As a result, GDFusion enables more reliableand accurate occupancy predictions.B.3. Results on Modern RNNsOur voxel-level history fusion module can be directly replaced with modern RNN methods such as RWKV [44], xLSTM [2],and Mamba [17]. In Tab.

The integration of GDFusion demonstratesconsistent and substantial performance enhancements across the baseline methods.Second, combining our proposed auxiliary temporal modules with a modern RNN method yields significant improvements.Third, while integrating modern RNN methods with our voxel-level fusion approach and other temporal fusion modules doesresult in improvements, it does not outperform the setting without modern RNNs (i.e., Our Full). We hypothesize that modernRNNs, which are designed for long-sequence context understanding in tasks like natural language processing, do not showclear advantages in the relatively short sequences of the nuScenes dataset when used solely for temporal fusion. Utilizingmodern RNNs for integrating both spatial and temporal dimensions could be explored as a direction for future research.B.4. Experiments on the Position of Scene-Level History Fusion in the FrameworkIn Tab. A.12, we investigate the impact of the position of scene-level history fusion on network performance on Occ3D.The baseline model employs voxel-level history fusion. Specifically, we consider several positions within the vision-basedsemantic occupancy network architecture: before the depth network, before voxel-level history fusion, after voxel-levelhistory fusion, and after the volume encoder, as well as multiple positions for scene-level fusion. The results in the tableindicate that scene-level fusion before the depth network or after the volume encoder performs worse compared to fusionbefore or after voxel-level history fusion. The poor performance of fusion before the depth network is attributed to the fusionoccurring in the 2D modality, where the difference in data structure limits its effectiveness compared to direct fusion in the3D modality. The inferior performance of fusion after the volume encoder is primarily because scene-level history fusionacts similarly to domain adaptation, which is beneficial for generating domain-independent features, favoring subsequentnetwork encoding. Therefore, fusion before the volume encoder, which is a densely encoding module, proves to be more4MethodmIoUmIoUDIoUBaseline38.031.071.1Our Vox his41.834.076.5RWKV38.231.372.2RWKV + Our Scene, Motion, Geometry His41.935.076.1xLSTM39.932.774.4xLSTM + Our Scene, Motion, Geometry His40.933.676.1Mamba41.233.975.0Mamba + Our Scene, Motion, Geometry His42.434.676.8RWKV + Our Vox his41.733.576.5RWKV + Our All His43.335.877.8xLSTM + Our Vox his42.234.776.4xLSTM + Our All his43.335.777.5Mamba + Our Vox his41.934.476.4Mamba + Our All his43.135.277.8Our Full43.335.377.8Table A.11.

We also experimented with multiple positions for scene-level fusion, but the results showed no significantadvantage over a single fusion position. Consequently, we only perform fusion after the voxel-level history fusion module inthe final method.B.5. Module Structure and Impact of Parameters ηs and ηmIn Tab. A.14, we explore different structural choices for scene-level history fusion on Occ3D. The baseline model utilizesvoxel-level temporal fusion. Jointly applying history fusion to both linear and LayerNorm parameters improves IoU to someextent, likely due to the influence of LN parameters on background categories, which occupy a large proportion of the scene.In the third row, we replace the linear layer with an MLP, which means using more parameters to store historical sceneinformation. However, experimental results indicate no significant gains, so we ultimately use only the linear and LN layersto store scene information.In Tab. A.14 and Tab. A.13, we evaluate the impact of the learning rate parameters ηs and ηm in scene-level temporalfusion and temporal motion fusion on model performance. The results demonstrate that our method is relatively insensitiveto these hyperparameters.5MethodηsmIoUmIoUDIoUScene His0.142.534.877.01.042.434.277.31042.334.177.510042.134.377.2w/o Gradient on γ, β0.142.334.477.11.042.434.576.91042.534.977.010042.134.376.6Linear →MLP0.0142.535.176.90.142.434.977.0Table A.14.

Due to the unpre-dictability and scarcity of anomalies, along with inherent difficultiesin collecting and annotating anomalous samples in real-world sce-narios, traditional AD methods typically adopt an unsupervisedparadigm, training only on accessible normal samples. However,obtaining sufficient normal samples can still be challenging, espe-cially in scenarios such as the initial manufacturing stages of newproducts or situations where sample collection itself is difficult. Assuch, Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has been proposed toreduce annotation costs and novel anomaly detection issues, whichholds significant promise for practical applications.FSAD aims at localizing anomalous regions within a query imageby leveraging a few normal support images belonging to the samearXiv:2504.11895v1 [cs.CV] 16 Apr 2025MM ’25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, IrelandQishan Wang, Jia Guo, Shuyong Gao, Haofen Wang, Li Xiong, Junjie Hu, Hanqi Guo, and Wenqiang Zhangobject category. Recently, inspired by the remarkable zero-shotclassification capabilities exhibited by vision-language foundationmodels, particularly CLIP [29], WinCLIP [19] and subsequent stud-ies [2, 44] have been proposed to exploit CLIP’s powerful represen-tation abilities to enhance the performance of low-shot anomalydetection models. Most existing methods fuse prompt-guided andvision-guided anomaly detection branches to obtain the final anom-aly score. The vision-guided branch typically stores the nominalpatch features into a visual memory bank, detecting anomalies intest samples based on high feature distances to their closest coun-terparts stored in memory. On the other hand, the prompt-guidedanomaly detection branch generates anomaly maps by performingmatrix operations between text and image features. For the text,numerous artificial prompts are usually manually designed [32]and/or learned [20], subsequently aggregated to yield normal or ab-normal textual features. However, since the aforementioned processrelies heavily on meticulous manual designs and/or partial learn-ing strategies, it is burdensome, struggles to generalize to unseenanomalies, and requires bespoke model weights for each datasetcategory—known as the ""one-category-one-model"" paradigm (seeFig. 1(a)). For the query image, as CLIP inherently struggles to cap-ture fine-grained local features, existing methods typically resort tosimple adapters [4, 11] that map image features to the joint embed-ding space for comparison with textual features. Alternatively, Li etal. [21] employ a V-V attention mechanism to preserve local infor-mation within the CLIP token representations. Considering theseintrinsic limitations of the CLIP-based model for FSAD, we are mo-tivated to explore a plain yet effective, training-free approach thatsolely relies on vision-guided anomaly detection and can generalizeacross various classes, referred to as the ""one-for-all"" paradigm.Inspired by the observation that few-shot anomaly detectionis feasible for human annotators relying solely on visual features,we propose a visual-only approach, VisionAD, which performsnearest neighbor searches based on vision foundation models and avisual memory bank. VisionAD can handle various types of productanomalies without requiring domain-specific training data. Instead,it only needs a few normal samples from the target category duringthe testing phase to perform anomaly detection. Due to its simplicityand effectiveness, VisionAD can be easily deployed in industrialscenarios, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).Specifically, VisionAD introduces three straightforward yet cru-cial elements to address the critical issue of limited support data,which typically leads to insufficient patch representations, withoutincreasing complexity or computational burden. First, intuitively,increasing the diversity of support data through simple data aug-mentation strategies can enhance the adaptability of feature match-ing. Augmentations, such as multiple rotations and flips appliedto support images, can further align the shape and orientationof anomalies—crucial for performance but largely overlooked inprevious studies. In addition to increasing the number of supportsamples, we propose to leverage the consistency and complemen-tarity provided by pseudo multi-view data (i.e., different views ofthe same object are semantically consistent yet complementary)to mitigate potential oversights of details and interference fromirrelevant local features caused by single-view predictions.

In contrast, we propose a multi-level feature fusion strategythat integrates intermediate-layer features to jointly capture long-range low-frequency and short-range high-frequency informationbefore performing comparisons, thus effectively enhancing cross-scale feature interactions while minimizing bias towards ImageNetclasses. Third, a class-aware visual memory bank is adopted withinthe one-for-all paradigm by leveraging the similarity between theclass tokens of the test image and stored ones.Search is All You Need for Few-shot Anomaly DetectionMM ’25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, IrelandExtensive experimental results on the MVTec, VisA, and Real-IAD datasets show that the proposed VisionAD achieves unprece-dented image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% underthe 1-shot setting, respectively, surpassing previous state-of-the-artmethods by a large margin, as illustrated in Figure 1(c).Our contributions are summarized as follows.• We propose VisionAD, a plain yet effective vision-only frame-work for FSAD that operates without complex prompt en-gineering or dataset-specific training, demonstrating thatsophisticated language-vision fusion is not necessary forachieving superior performance in FSAD.• We introduce three crucial components to address the limitedsupport data challenge: dual augmentation strategy that com-bines support augmentation and pseudo multi-view transfor-mation, multi-level feature fusion for capturing both globaland local information, and class-aware visual memory banksenabling efficient one-for-all detection across categories.• We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular bench-marks, demonstrating that VisionAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection, establishingits effectiveness and generalizability across various productcategories and datasets.2Related WorksFew-shot anomaly detection is designed for scenarios where only alimited amount of normal data is available for training. In this case,normal samples may not fully capture the variability of normality.Many current studies focus on addressing this challenge and can beclassified into two categories: CLIP-based (prompt-guided) FSADand feature-matching-based (vision-guided) FSAD.CLIP-based FSAD. Since CLIP [29] has demonstrated remark-able performance in zero-shot and few-shot classification, it hasgained significant attention and is widely studied for its potentialapplication in anomaly detection. CLIP not only provides descrip-tive visual embeddings but also computes the similarity betweentext prompts and test images, as seen in works [4, 11, 19, 20, 25, 32].WinCLIP [19] designs manual text prompts for both normal andanomalous cases, utilizing sliding windows to extract and aggregatemultiscale patch-based votes. APRIL-GAN [4] uses additional lin-ear layers to align patch-level image features with textual featuresin order to generate anomaly maps. AnomalyGPT[11] generatestraining data by simulating anomalous images and producing cor-responding textual descriptions for each image. PromptAD [20]constructs a large number of negative samples through semanticconcatenation. Additionally, it introduces the explicit abnormaledges module to control the margin between normal prompt fea-tures and anomaly prompt features. KAG-prompt [32] proposes akernel-aware hierarchical graph to capture cross-layer contextualinformation, leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. One-for-All [25] learns a class-shared prompt generator to adaptivelygenerate suitable prompts for each instance. In addition, it proposesa category-aware memory bank to retrieve valid similar featuresunder the one-for-all paradigm. However, these methods eitherrequire elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning of the promptembeddings.Feature-matching-based FSAD. Patch feature matching re-search is based on the underlying idea of comparing the patchfeatures of test samples with those of normal samples to computeanomaly scores [6, 8, 12, 24, 31]. UniVAD [12] employs the Con-textual Component Clustering (C3) module, Component-AwarePatch Matching (CAPM), and Graph-Enhanced Component Mod-eling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies at different semanticlevels and across various domains. INP-Former [24] extracts intrin-sic normal prototypes directly from the test image and guides theDecoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstructionerrors serving as anomaly scores. PatchCore [31] uses a maximallyrepresentative memory bank of nominal patch features to detectand segment anomalous data at test time. SPADE [6] relies on theK nearest neighbors of pixel-level feature pyramids to detect andsegment anomalies within images. PaDiM [8] uses a pretrainedconvolutional neural network for patch embedding and multivari-ate Gaussian distributions to obtain a probabilistic representationof the normal class. However, these approaches are not designedfor few-shot settings and lack simplicity and generality, so theirperformance may not meet the demands of manufacturing.In this research, instead of using category tokens extracted fromthe Q-Former [25], we leverage class token similarity to retrievetarget patch features. Additionally, we propose a straightforwardnearest-neighbor search framework, driven by advanced visionfoundations, that can efficiently perform anomaly detection with alimited amount of data, thereby meeting the demands of manufac-turing.3MethodGiven an FSAD dataset containing 𝑁classes 𝑪= {C1, C2, · · · , C𝑁},the general few-shot anomaly detection setting typically se-lects only one class C𝑖(where 𝑖= 1, 2, · · · , 𝑁indicates theclass number), using the one-category-one-model set 𝜒𝑖={(𝑥𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖,𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙), (𝑥𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖,𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙,𝑥𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖,𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑦)}. In contrast, a more practicalone-for-all setting encompasses all classes 𝑪, covering the all-classsets 𝜒= Í𝑁𝑖=1 𝜒𝑖within one unified model. It should be noted thatunder both settings, each class contains at most 𝐾examples, with𝐾typically taking values of 1, 2, or 4. In this paper, we focus onleveraging the reference dataset 𝑪to detect and localize anomaliesacross various categories under the one-for-all paradigm.3.1VisionAD FrameworkSince language-guided approaches require elaborate designs fortraining and often struggle to capture fine-grained local features,certain defects can only be detected via visual reference. For in-stance, ""Metal Nut"" in MVTecAD has an anomaly type labeled as""flipped upside-down,"" which can only be identified relatively froma normal image. Therefore, we propose VisionAD, a purely vision-based patch-matching framework that leverages vision foundationmodels and effective feature fusion to construct a memory bankM. This memory bank stores informative patch-level feature mapsof nominal samples at multiple semantic scales. Then, we applydata augmentation to expand the memory bank and better alignit with test samples. Identical augmentations are simultaneouslyapplied to both query and reference images to obtain more infor-mative multi-view anomaly scores. Additionally, we introduce aMM ’25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, IrelandQishan Wang, Jia Guo, Shuyong Gao, Haofen Wang, Li Xiong, Junjie Hu, Hanqi Guo, and Wenqiang ZhangMVTec-ADQuery ImageUnified InputsVisA… Real-IADAug.

In thispaper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighborsearch framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in bothsingle-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios.

50,A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning_ from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce.pdf,"provides the largest gain in reward, highlighting their harmful impact. In contrast, the reward of removingcorrect samples is still not satisfactory. Mean-zero normalization increases KL loss and destabilizes training.Normalizing by standard deviation shows minimal additional benefit. The variant “Reinforce + Removeboth” achieves a good balance between reward, KL stability, and entropy regularization. We transform theoriginal reward using (1 + r)/2 so that the resulting value corresponds to the accuracy on the training data.We also apply a moving average with a window size of 20 to smooth the curves.5ConclusionWe revisited the design space of reinforcement learning algorithms for LLM post-training through the lensof rejection sampling.Our study shows that RAFT—a simple rejection-based method relying solely onpositively rewarded samples—serves as a surprisingly strong baseline, outperforming or matching more so-phisticated approaches such as PPO and iterative DPO. We further improved RAFT by incorporating9importance sampling and clipping, resulting in RAFT++, which achieves near state-of-the-art performancewhile maintaining a simple and stable training pipeline.Through extensive ablations, we identified that GRPO’s primary benefit comes not from its rewardnormalization, but from discarding prompts with entirely correct and incorrect responses. Building on thisinsight, we proposed Reinforce-Rej, a minimal policy gradient variant that filters both entirely incorrect andentirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and entropy stability, highlighting the role ofexploration in reward-based fine-tuning.Our findings suggest that the utility of negative samples in RL-based LLM training is more nuanced thanpreviously assumed. Rather than relying on raw negative feedback, future methods should consider moreselective and principled mechanisms for incorporating sample quality. We advocate RAFT and Reinforce-Rejas lightweight, interpretable, and effective baselines for future work on reward-driven LLM post-training.ReferencesAhmadian, A., Cremer, C., Gall´e, M., Fadaee, M., Kreutzer, J., Pietquin, O., ¨Ust¨un, A., and Hooker, S.(2024).

Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical successin training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. Inthis work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components.Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positivelyrewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies revealthat GRPO’s main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, ratherthan from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimalextension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rejimproves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RLalgorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advancesshould focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on themindiscriminately.

By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINNovercomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensional-ity. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data,the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In thisstudy, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely ConstrainedLearning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or mo-tions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computationalprinciples and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learn-ing were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message PassingOptimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tai-lored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balancethe fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is availableat github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL. Experimentson synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effec-tively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and theunderlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task ofmetabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-drivenflux estimators.1IntroductionPhysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of machine learningmodels that integrate physical laws into the training process of neural networks[34, 20]. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on data for training,PINNs incorporate known physical principles to guide the learning process,which has been shown to improve the model’s accuracy and generalizability,especially in scenarios where data is scarce, noisy, or potentially high-dimensional∗dangpe@ohsu.edu†zhangchi@ohsu.edu1arXiv:2504.12675v1 [cs.LG] 17 Apr 2025[34, 11, 20]. In the realm of biological sciences, PINNs gained its popularitygiven the fundamental challenge to discover the mathematical equations thatgovern biological systems from observed data [48, 10, 12]. From neuroscienceto biomechanics, from pharmacokinetics to metabolic flux analysis, PINNsoffer a versatile framework for capturing intricate interactions and dynamicswithin biological systems [39, 12, 51, 30].For instance, PINNs have beenutilized to model neuronal activity and network dynamics, to shed light on theunderlying mechanisms of cognition and behavior [19, 44]. Moreover, PINNshave facilitated the simulation of tissue biomechanics, to aid in the design ofprosthetics and rehabilitation strategies [51]. Additionally, the idea of PINNshas been instrumental in deciphering the kinetics of metabolic pathways, andoffering insights into disease mechanisms [30].Despite its groundbreaking capability, PINNs require time course data asinput to effectively capture temporal dynamics via differential equations. How-ever, for many systems, only static or snapshot data is available, diminishingthe efficacy of PINNs. Moreover, PINNs always rely on the measurement ofall relevant variables in dynamic systems for accurate approximation, posingchallenges in scenarios where obtaining such data is expensive, impractical, orlimited. For instance, in the approximation of traffic flow [33], the dependence onextensive high-speed camera measures can impede the modeling process. Instead,low-speed or one-shot photos or even noise or dust measures on each specificroad can be applied to approximate traffic flows. Similarly, in biological systems,such as human disease tissue metabolism, detailed temporal observations areoften unattainable, and many variables may only be measured in a subset ofstudy subjects. The challenges of working with partially observed, non-timecourse data underscore the need for novel approaches to extend the applicabilityof PINNs to a broader range of scientific and engineering problems.In this study, we propose a new learning framework, namely ConstrainedLearning, to address the limitations of PINNs and enhance their applicabilitywhen time-course data and direct measurement of key variables in the system areunavailable. We begin by presenting the mathematical principles underpinningConstrained Learning and its general mathematical formulation. Recognizingthat Constrained Learning does not fit within the traditional paradigms ofsupervised or unsupervised learning, we developed a new optimization algorithm,named MPO-SL, that can optimize general models of Constrained Learning. Wefurther demonstrate the application of this framework to a specific problem:the estimation of mass-carrying flux over a network using non-time courseand partially observed data. We introduce a new PINN architecture, namedMPOCtrL, to approximate flux rates over a network by leveraging the governingphysical laws of the system to the fitting of the observed data. Experimentsusing synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that the MPOCtrL modeland the MPO-SL algorithm can effectively estimate the flux over the networksof different topological properties using non-time course and partially observeddata, thereby validating the feasibility of the Constrained Learning framework.The key contributions of this study are summarized as follows and bench-marked with experiments:21. Development of a new learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning,to approximate dynamic models using non-time course and partially observeddata.2. Design of a new optimization algorithm to effectively and efficiently solvethe general Constrained Learning problems.3. Development of a new PINN architecture, namely MPOCtrL, to estimateflux over complex networks using non-time course and partially observed data.2Related Work2.1Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)Initially proposed by Raissi et al. [34], PINNs offer a unique framework forsolving inverse problems by integrating data-driven insights with physics-basedconstraints. It has gained popularity across various scientific fields such as fluiddynamics [35, 40, 28] and material science [14, 7, 50]. However, despite theirpotential, training PINNs can often be computationally intensive [45], and theperformance of PINNs can significantly vary with the choice of hyperparametersand the network architecture, raising concerns on robustness [6].Ongoingresearch continues to address these challenges, and tools like DeepXDE [26] andhybrid models that combine traditional numerical solvers with neural networks[29] advanced the accessibility and efficiency of PINNs. Improving the scalabilityof PINNs to tackle multi-physics and multi-scale problems is also garneringincreasing attention [20]. Training PINNs typically requires the input of time-course data. However, obtaining the necessary time-course or spatial data forPINNs is challenging for many research areas, complicating their applications[43, 2]. The development of PINNs for datasets that lack time-series informationpresents a significant challenge, but also holds immense potential if successful.2.2Data Driven Flux AnalysisThe flux dynamics of a system are typically described using differential equationsto quantify the rate at which mass, energy, or momentum passes through a surfaceor region. In chemical diffusion, this is governed by Fick’s laws, as seen in reaction-diffusion systems [18]. In fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations apply,such as in the modeling of blood flow to identify key hemodynamic biomarkersof cardiovascular diseases [3, 41].Metabolic flux, governed by mass actionkinetics, measures the rates at which metabolites are produced or consumedwithin a metabolic network [47, 13]. While PINNs have successfully modeledthese systems, obtaining time-course data could be challenging especially wheninvolving live objects such as model organisms or humans.We next briefly review the background of metabolic flux modeling. Fluxbalance analysis (FBA) has been a popular tool for modeling metabolic fluxdynamics that solves the flux rate of reactions in a complex metabolic networkunder steady-state assumption[30, 21, 36]. The steady-state conditions describes3that intermediate metabolites will not change over time, constraining the solutionspace of flux on the surface of a high dimensional polytope [42] (Figure 1a).Recent developments have focused on integrating FBA with high-throughputgenomic data[24] to enable a data-driven flux analysis [16]. For example, Wagneret al. [43] introduced Compass, and Alghamdi, et al. [2] introduced a graphneural network model called scFEA, both of which leverages single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and FBA to infer metabolic states at the cellular level.While Compass and scFEA estimate flux dynamics using static data, they facesignificant challenges due to their reliance on comprehensive and high-qualitygenomic datasets, which are often sparse and noisy. In addition, both methodslack robust feature selection strategies to select relevant biological features fromcomplex networks. Moreover, scFEA’s neural network-based approach suffersfrom convergence and stability issues. These limitations highlight the need fora robust and interpretable method that could leverage the power of PINNs tohandle non-time course data.Final SolutionInitial ValueFB Solution Space(a)(b)(c)MPO-SLFigure 1: (a) Constrained Learning-based formulation of the flux estimationproblem, (b) geometric illustration of the MPOCtrL optimization algorithm, (c)framework of the MPOCtrL algorithm.3Mathematical consideration and method formu-lations3.1Notations and preliminariesGeneral notations.

Werepresent a dynamic system using the general tuple definition: S∆= {X, F, T},where X = {x1, ..., xn} is a set of variables that take values on a finite spaceX = {X1, ..., Xn} ⊆Rn, T denotes time, and F is the set of functions thatcharacterizes the change of X over T, F∆= { dxidt |i = 1, ..., n} : U ⊆(X × T) →X.A conventional PINN-based solution of S approximates F by fitting the dynamicchanges of X over time using observed data Dtime = {{Xt1, t1}, ..., {Xtm, tm}} ⊂X ×T, where t1, ..., tm are the time of observations that can be either continuousor discrete. In contrast, our study addresses the approximation of F under twochallenging conditions (1) the time information t is either absent or too scarcein D to support a supervised fitting of F, and (2) X is not fully observed in D,as defined below.Definition 1 PINN for dynamic systems using non-time course andpartially observed data(Problem Definition). For a dynamic system S = {X ={x1, ..., xn}, F, T} and non-time course data D containing partial observations ofX from m samples, D = {D1, ..., Dm} ⊂{X ∪L}, the goal of this PINN problemis to identify functions Fi to approximatedxidt , ∀i = 1, ..., n; and obtain thefunctional values of Fi associated with each sample in D, i.e., Fi(Dj) ∼dxidt (j),∀j = 1, ..., m.By Definition 1, D doesn’t contain effective time information. For instance,in traffic flow problems, car counts collected hourly have time gaps too large toestimate real-time traffic flow accurately; in biological flux estimation problem,biological reaction rate over time can not be collected at all. Consequently, theseobservations can only be viewed as independent samples. In addition, L is alatent space that indicates E could be partially or entirely unobserved. Forexample, in traffic flow approximation, one might collect roadside noise or dustlevels instead of actual car counts, leading to incomplete or indirect observations.Directed Factor Graph-based representation of dynamic systems.To solve the dynamic system S = {X, F, T} using non-time course data, weintroduce a Directed Factor Graph (DFG) to represent S.Denote a DFGas GDF = (V DF , EDF ), where V = {Vfa, Vva} includes two types of nodes,namely Factors (Vfa) and V ariables (Vva). In GDF , a factor node can beonly linked by a variable node, and a variable node can be only linked bya factor node. Each edge has a direction. Thus, EDF consists of all edgesfrom factor nodes to variable nodes, i.e., EVfa→Vva, as well as all edges fromvariable nodes to factor nodes, i.e., EVva→Vfa. To define S over GDF , we firstlet Vfa∆= X = {x1, ..., xn}. We further define a set of functions fk : Uk ⊆X →U ′k ⊆X, Uk ∩U ′k = ∅, k = 1, ..., K, i.e. each fk takes two non-overlapping subsets6of Vfa as its input and output, which are denoted as V infk and V outfk . Then wedefine Vva∆= {fk}. For a given S = {X, F, T}, we can further derive that therealways exists a set of fk as defined above, for any dxidt ∈F : U ⊆(X) →Xk,dxidt = Pk|xi∈V outfk γikfk + Pk′|xi∈V infk′ γik′fk′, where γik and γik′ are boundedpositive and negative weights that could be pre-computed based on the physicalproperty of S. Because the input and output sets of fk are non-overlapping,γik and γik′ can be stored by one n × K real matrix Γ, in which Γik < 0if xi ∈V infk , Γik > 0 if xi ∈V outfk , and Γik = 0 if xi if not adjacent to fk.Then the edge set EDF = {EVfa→Vva, EVva→Vfa} can naturally be defined by{V infk →fk, fk →V outfk }. Thus, S could be represented by GDF as X = Vfa andF = Γ ∗Vva. We call fk as message functions. The impact of fk on dxidt iscontrolled by the physical weight γik.ODEs in S, message over GDF , and physical constraints-informedlearning. For the PINN problem described in Definition 1, observations in D ⊂{X ∪L} can be viewed as attributes on GDF by assigning D∩Vfai ∈Xi to the ithfactor node Vfai and related features in L to the kth variable node Vvak, denotedas D ∩Vvak ∈L.Because { dx1(j)dt, ..., dxn(j)dt}T = Γ ∗{f1(Dj), ..., fk(Dj)}T ,identifying Fi(Dj) ∼dxi(j)dtis equivalent to identifying {fk}, here",A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a

We focus on the optimization of two fundamental components:1) Training pipeline, through large-scale pretraining, high-quality supervised finetuning, and GRPO8training, SimpleAR achieves competitive performance on existing text-to-image generation bench-marks with only 0.5B parameters. 2) Inference efficiency, we explore various inference accelerationtechniques, and show SimpleAR could generate a 1024×1024 image in around 14 seconds whenserved with vLLM. We hope this work can inspire further exploration into autoregressive visualgeneration and firmly believe that it is a promising alternative to diffusion models.Despite the superior results achieved, we admit that there still exist many limitations that are worthdeeper improvements or exploring:Stronger visual tokenizers: the reconstruction performance of Cosmos-Tokenizer [16] is limited,especially in capturing fine-grained visual details, e.g., faces and texts. This leaves room for bettervisual generation results with improved tokenization methods.Text-to-video generation: compared to text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation presentssignificantly more challenges since the model has to generate coherent outputs that are contextuallyand temporally consistent.Native multimodal understanding and generation: recently, the native multimodal understandingand generation capabilities of GPT-4o have captured widespread attention. It offers a glimpse intothe future of models that can seamlessly integrate vision, text, and even audio without relying onmodality-specific encodings. Moving SimpleAR forward, building truly native large multimodalmodels that can perform end-to-end reasoning across images, text, and other modalities is a promisingand crucial research direction.","This work presents SimpleAR, a vanilla autoregressive visual generation frameworkwithout complex architecure modifications. Through careful exploration of trainingand inference optimization, we demonstrate that: 1) with only 0.5B parameters,our model can generate 1024×1024 resolution images with high fidelity, andachieve competitive results on challenging text-to-image benchmarks, e.g., 0.59on GenEval and 79.66 on DPG; 2) both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GroupRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training could lead to significant improve-ments on generation aesthectics and prompt alignment; and 3) when optimized withinference acceleraton techniques like vLLM, the time for SimpleAR to generate an1024×1024 image could be reduced to around 14 seconds. By sharing these find-ings and open-sourcing the code, we hope to reveal the potential of autoregressivevisual generation and encourage more participation in this research field."

We focus ourstudy on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social me-dia, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correla-tions between gender and discourse words – discovered viaLDA and BERTopic – to automatically form gendered dis-course word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gen-dered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and findthat gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in thedomains of business, technology/politics, and video games.Next, we study the representation of these gendered discoursewords from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model fromOpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have amore stable and robust representation than the feminine dis-course words, which may result in better system performanceon downstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded fortheir discourse patterns with better system performance byone of the state-of-the-art language models – and this em-bedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculinedefault.github.com/mariateleki/masculine-defaultsIntroductionMasculine defaults are a type of gender bias “in which char-acteristics and behaviors associated with the male genderrole are valued, rewarded, or regarded as standard, normal,neutral, or necessary aspects of a given cultural context”(Cheryan and Markus 2020). Hence, there are three parts to amasculine default: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the male char-acteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simplyacceptance (neutral) of the male characteristics or behaviors.Copyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of ArtificialIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Figure 1: An overview of our two-part framework: (i) Usingour Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF, asshown in Figure 2), we obtain gendered discourse word lists.(ii) We then perform our Discourse Word-Embedding As-sociation Test (D-WEAT, as shown here in Figure 1). Weform parallel sentences, s and s′, by swapping masculinediscourse words (e.g. “going”) for feminine discourse words(e.g. “like”): s = And I was going, hey, it’s cold outside...,and s′ = And I was like, hey, it’s cold outside... We find thatthe masculine discourse words have a more stable embed-ding representation – this is a representational harm and amasculine default.Hence, to determine whether or not a behavior consti-tutes a masculine default (Cheryan and Markus 2020),we consider: What is the reward or standard associatedwith a given masculine behavior or characteristic? Forexample, in the cultural context of the United States, theprevalence of men in computer science is a masculine de-fault, as men are economically rewarded for being computerscientists via statistically higher salaries (U.S. Bureau of La-bor Statistics 2023), and are largely socially accepted in thisrole (Cheryan and Markus 2020). This masculine default,then, propagates social injustice, as “women feel a lowerarXiv:2504.11431v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025sense of belonging and anticipate less success” in computerscience, and do not enter the field at a comparable rate tomen and reap the economic rewards (Cheryan and Markus2020; American Society for Engineering Education 2022).These masculine defaults result in the other-ing of women(Beauvoir 1949).Considerable prior research has examined gender dif-ferences in social media (e.g., Wang, Pappu, and Cramer(2021); Kalhor et al. (2023); Johnson et al. (2021); Wangand Horv´at (2019)) and in LLMs (e.g., Dong et al. (2023);Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan (2017); May et al. (2019);Bolukbasi et al. (2016)). But how do masculine defaultsmanifest on social media? And how do they impact emerg-ing systems like large language models (LLMs) that aretrained in part over social media? While masculine defaultsare highly connected to gender differences,1 there is a re-search gap in identifying and analyzing masculine defaultsthat arise through gender differences in discourse.Specifically, we focus on patterns of discourse in spo-ken communication, including fillers (e.g., uh, um), dis-course markers (e.g., well, you know, I mean), false starts(e.g., It was, anyways, I went to Target yesterday) and more(Merriam-Webster 2024; Shriberg 1994). Such discoursewords are non-content related words that serve importantsocial purposes with respect to gender, such as to “hold thefloor” in conversation (Shriberg 1994, 1996). Previous worknotes gender differences in how men and women use specifictypes of discourse words – for example, men use more filledpauses and repeats (Shriberg 1996; Bortfeld et al. 2001) thanwomen. However, these studies lack an automated methodfor large-scale discourse word discovery and gender analy-sis, primarily relying on the Switchboard corpus (Mitchellet al. 1999) – an older, human-annotated corpus which is notrepresentative of the range of natural speech patterns, as thephone calls were recorded in the manufactured, awkward sit-uation of randomly-pairing two callers and assigning them atopic to discuss.Hence, we propose in this paper a twofold framework for(i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered dis-course words in spoken content via our Gendered DiscourseCorrelation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurementof the gender bias associated with these gendered discoursewords in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding As-sociation Test (D-WEAT). Concretely, we focus our studyon podcasts, a popular and growing form of social me-dia (Clifton et al. 2020). According to Pew Research, “42%of Americans ages 12 and older have listened to a podcast in1We consider the binary definitions of sex (female/male) andgender (women/men, feminine/masculine) in our work due to (i)continuity with previous work in the gender debiasing task in theNLP community (Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan 2017; Boluk-basi et al. 2016), and (ii) modeling constraints – i.e., we useinaSpeechSegmenter (Doukhan et al. 2018a) for gender approxi-mation via the podcast audio signal. The binary gender definition,however, is not representative of the sex and gender spectrums, andtransgender, intersex, intersectional identities, and other identitiesare also not represented (Ghai, Hoque, and Mueller 2021; Ovalleet al. 2023; Seaborn, Chandra, and Fabre 2023). This is an impor-tant direction for future work.the past month” as of 2023 compared to 12% in 2013 (ThePew Research Center 2023). We analyze the rewards as-sociated with gendered discourse words in 15,117 podcastepisodes from the Spotify Podcast Dataset (Clifton et al.2020) – i.e., discourse words with significant positive cor-relations with either men or women – to determine whetheror not masculine defaults are present. Our study is organizedaround the following research questions:• RQ0: How are women and men’s discourse different?• RQ1: Are discourse-based masculine defaults present indomain-specific contexts?• RQ2: Are discourse-based masculine defaults present inLLM embeddings?We first (RQ0) introduce our Gendered Discourse Cor-relation Framework (GDCF), a framework for discoveringgendered discourse words, with features which are centeredaround spoken content – specifically, an audio-based GEN-DER SEGMENTER (Doukhan et al. 2018a), a TOPIC MOD-ELER via LDA (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) and BERTopic(Grootendorst 2022), and a specialized CONVERSATIONALPARSER (Jamshid Lou and Johnson 2020). We analyzecorrelations between gender and discourse words to auto-matically form gendered discourse word lists. Additionally,GDCF is a flexible framework which can be extended toother forms of audio speech data – such as short videosthat are prevalent on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, longvideos on YouTube, streamers on Twitch, and more.We then study (RQ1) the prevalence of these gendereddiscourse words in domain-specific contexts. We find thatmasculine discourse words are positively correlated with thebusiness domain. Because participation in the business do-main grants economic rewards, there are indeed discourse-based masculine defaults present in the business domain. Weadditionally show that this is the case for the domains oftechnology/politics and video games, and provide more, re-lated results in the Appendix.Next, we study (RQ2) the representation of these gen-dered discourse words in a state-of-the-art LLM embeddingsmodel from OpenAI, text-embedding-3-large. Wefind that the masculine discourse words have a more stableand robust representation than the feminine discourse words,resulting in better system performance on downstream tasksfor men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse pat-terns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models – and therefore this difference inthe embedding representations for women and men consti-tutes a representational harm (Blodgett et al. 2020) and amasculine default.Resources. We release our code at https://github.com/mariateleki/masculine-defaults and the extended results athttps://www.gendered-discourse.net.Related WorkSex, Gender, and Language.We focus in our work ongender rather than sex:1 sex (female/male) is establishedbased on biology; whereas, gender (women/men, feminine/-masculine) “is the activity of managing situated conductin light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activi-ties appropriate for one’s sex category” (West and Zimmer-man 1987; Unger 1979; Muehlenhard and Peterson 2011).Gender is something that people “do,” and “gender [canbe understood] as a routine, methodological, and recurringaccomplishment” (West and Zimmerman 1987). In But-ler’s theory of gender performativity, “[g]ender is insti-tuted through the stylization of the body and, hence, mustbe understood as the mundane way in which bodily ges-tures, movements, and enactments of various kinds consti-tute the illusion of an abiding gendered self” (Butler 1988)– an enactment, then, includes language: the way womenand men speak. Butler argues that conforming to this gen-der schema – wherein certain “attitudes,” “activities,” “at-tributes,” and “behaviors”, including language, are assignedto either women or men (Bem 1984; West and Zimmerman1987) – is necessary for women to “ask for recognition in thelaw or in political life” (Butler 2009). In this way, masculin-ities and femininities relate to social and political power.Hegemonic masculinity refers to a performative, “‘cur-rently accepted’ strategy” for maintaining the patriarchal im-balance of social and political power via cultural dominance(Connell 1995, 1987). Maintaining power necessitates dif-ferent strategies over time, thus, hegemonic masculinity ishighly contextual. One recent type of hegemonic masculin-ity is technomasculinity – the form of masculinity associatedwith high-tech professions, such as engineering and science(Cooper 2000; Lockhart 2015; Bulut 2020; Goree, Crandall,and Su 2023). Hence, as gender and gender roles are highlycontextual, we limit our definition of gender temporally, torecently, and geographically, to the United States.Hegemonic masculinity, then, is closely related to mas-culine defaults, which are a form of other-ing – conciouslyand/or subconciously – that occurs as the result of the mas-culine social and political hierarchy. “Masculine defaults in-clude ideas, values, policies, practices, interaction styles,norms, artifacts, and beliefs that often do not appear todiscriminate by gender but result in disadvantaging morewomen than men” (Cheryan and Markus 2020). Masculinedefaults relate to other-ing in that “alterity is the fundamen-tal category of human thought” and “He is the Subject; heis the Absolute. She is the Other” (Beauvoir 1949). In otherwords, he is the default, and she is the other. An example of amasculine default in language is the use of masculine gener-ics, as “[a]n almost universal and fundamental asymmetrylies in the use of masculine generics. In English, for exam-ple, generic he can be used when gender is irrelevant (e.g.,the user... he)” rather than ‘she’ (Sczesny, Formanowicz, andMoser 2016). For a masculine behavior to be considered amasculine default, there must be a reward or a standard as-sociated with the use of the masculine behavior (Cheryanand Markus 2020).Podcast Language Analysis.Podcasts have come underincreased research scrutiny in the past few years. For ex-ample, Yang et al. (2019) analyzed non-textual characteris-tics of podcasts (like energy or seriousness) through audiospectrogram representation learning methods. Clifton et al.(2020) conducted an analysis of the Spotify dataset podcasts,where they also found that discourse topics exist, and theyfound a higher frequency of first-person pronouns and am-plifiers as compared to the Brown corpus. Valero, Baranes,and Epure (2022) studied topic modeling on podcasts forinformation retrieval with the Spotify dataset. Martikainen,Karlgren, and Truong (2022) have examined how stylisticfeatures relate to genres on a small scale using PCA andk-means clustering: they analyzed a subset of 14 episodesthen a subset of 911 episodes. They also used inaSpeechSeg-menter (Doukhan et al. 2018a) to obtain gender correlations.Rezapour et al. (2020) looked at using the iTunes topics andnamed entities to generate extractive summaries.Closest to this work, Reddy et al. (2021) analyzed therelationships between linguistic features and engagement(measured via podcast popularity) over the Spotify dataset.In contrast, our work focuses on measuring feature correla-tions related to gender and discourse. Hence, we introducetwo new modules, the GENDER SEGMENTER module andthe CONVERSATIONAL PARSER module, to assist us in ouraim of focusing on gender and discourse, rather than popu-larity.Large Language Models (LLM) and Discourse Words.Large language models are trained on gender imbalancedpatterns of discourse usage – be it on podcasts, YouTubevideos, and/or other social media formats. It is well-recognized that LLMs can inherit and propagate genderstereotypes (Bolukbasi et al. 2016). Thus, with respect togender, important discourse words should be representedequally in the embedding space, just as stereotype wordsare via gender debiasing methods (Caliskan, Bryson, andNarayanan 2017; May et al. 2019). Current gender debi-asing methods in natural language processing (NLP) typi-cally ignore this prevalent discourse signal, instead focus-ing on stereotypes, such as occupational stereotypes likedoctor/nurse (Bolukbasi et al. 2016), and other stereotypecategories like science/arts and career/family in the Word-Embedding Association Test (WEAT) (Caliskan, Bryson,and Narayanan 2017) and the WEAT extension, the Sen-tence Encoder Association Test (SEAT) (May et al. 2019).Both WEAT and SEAT tests are based on the Implicit Asso-ciation Test (IAT) from the field of psychology (Greenwald,McGhee, and Schwartz 1998).While not all discourse words are gender-stereotyped,some are. Consider some of the words from our study: go-ing, know, and things are not stereotyped. However, considerthe word like, which women in popular media tend to useoften – such as in the iconic line from the 2001 hit movie,Legally Blonde: “What, like, it’s hard?” Hence, we differfrom WEAT in that we extend WEAT beyond stereotyping,to include discourse words which are correlated with menor women, and hence carry implicit (Seaborn, Chandra, andFabre","Masculine defaults are widely recognized as a significant typeof gender bias, but they are often unseen as they are under-researched. Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i)the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or be-haviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of,those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work,we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and proposea twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and"
55,A Phenomenological Approach to Analyzing User Queries in IT Systems Using Heidegger_s Fundamental Ontology.pdf,"arXiv:2504.12977v1 [cs.SE] 17 Apr 2025A Phenomenological Approach to Analyzing User Queries in ITSystems Using Heidegger’s Fundamental OntologyMaksim VishnevskiySeminars ""Philosophy + IT""vmaxims@gmail.comApril 18, 2025Heidegger’s philosophy, though primarily ontological, has found selective but signiﬁcant applications intechnology and computer science, oﬀering frameworks to rethink human-technology interactions. Drey-fus (1991) applied Heidegger’s concept of being-in-the-world to critique early AI paradigms, highlightingtheir neglect of contextual engagement. Winograd and Flores (1986) drew on Heidegger to reconceptu-alize system design, emphasizing context and meaning in human-computer interaction. Dourish (2001)advanced these ideas in human-computer interaction (HCI), advocating phenomenological approaches tointerface design. In natural language processing (NLP), technical advancements like Transformer modelshave enabled context-sensitive query processing, yet philosophical perspectives remain underexplored.This paper builds on these foundations, applying Heidegger’s Fundamental Ontology to enhance userquery analysis in IT systems, particularly in dialogues involving metaphorical and technical descriptions.The growing complexity of user queries in IT systems, especially in artiﬁcial intelligence researchand particularly artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI), demands tools capable of identifying and resolvinglogical inconsistencies, such as recursive patterns arising from self-reference in questions and answers.Traditional analytical systems like IBM Watson or Palantir excel at categorical analysis but fail to ad-dress ontological issues tied to deeper thought structures. This paper describes an IT system conceptbased on Heidegger’s Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing beings and Being.The system uses twomodally distinct, non-overlapping languages: categorical for user inputs and existential for internal anal-ysis, linked via phenomenological reduction. This enables analysis of user queries, including dialogues,identifying recursions, and providing solutions in accessible categorical terms. Full realization requires1Phenomenological Analysis of User Queries (M. Vishnevskiy)formalizing the language of Being by a research team focused on its structure within Heidegger’s Funda-mental Ontology; given the descriptive completeness of the language of beings, this ensures the system’scomputability at the level of completeness, making it a universal tool for ontological query analysis.The system does not aim to provide operational deﬁnitions of concepts like consciousness or Beingfor direct implementation in programming language syntax (e.g., C++ or Prolog), as is common intraditional cybernetics. Instead, beings and Being serve as distinct, non-mixing environments structuringthe system’s architecture, designed to analyze recursive patterns in user queries—e.g., in NLP tasks forAGI, where traditional tools detect logical loops (e.g., “consciousness deﬁnes subjectivity, and subjectivitydeﬁnes consciousness”) but oﬀer no resolutions.The system is relevant for processing queries in interdisciplinary scientiﬁc contexts, where program-mers, physicists, mathematicians, neuroscientists, philosophers, and other experts explore AGI’s sub-jectivity and consciousness. The paper presents the system’s principles (Section 2), internal structure(Section 3), user interface (Section 4), technical implementation (Section 5), use cases based on userqueries (Section 6), comparison with modern systems (Section 7), and discussion of signiﬁcance andlimitations (Section 8).2Main PrinciplesThe system is grounded in Heidegger’s distinction between beings (das Seiende) and Being (das Sein),implemented through two modally distinct, non-overlapping languages:• Language of beings (das Seiende): A categorical language describing entities, their proper-ties, and relations (e.g., “query terms,” “user intent,” “computational processes” in IT contexts,or “concepts,” “universality,” “experience” in conceptual query analysis). Used for processing userqueries.• Language of Being (das Sein): An existential language describing modes and modalities ofBeing through concepts like Dasein, openness, non-spatio-temporal being, temporality, and others.Applied for internal ontological analysis of query structures.These languages remain separated due to their modal diﬀerences, with interaction facilitated by a phe-nomenological reduction module linking categorical and existential interpretations. Notably, the “lan-guage of beings” and “language of Being” are not traditional programming constructs (e.g., C++ pro-cedures) but structural environments deﬁning the system’s architecture. The categorical language ofbeings is implemented using existing technologies like RDF/OWL and graph models, while the existen-tial language of Being draws on the modes and modalities of Heidegger’s Fundamental Ontology, such asDasein, openness, and temporality.3Internal System Operation3.1User Query AnalysisThe system processes user queries (e.g., questions and answers in dialogues) using NLP methods, cap-turing phenomena at a pre-categorical level. For instance, the question “Who are we?” in an AGI-relatedquery or the statement “Some concepts are universal” in an experience-related query is treated as “some-thing” without immediate categorization.3.2Dual InterpretationEach phenomenon is interpreted simultaneously in both languages:• Categorical description (language of beings): The phenomenon is broken into categories like“query terms,” “user intent,” or “cognitive processes” for IT queries, or “concepts,” “universality,”“orientation,” and “culture” for conceptual queries, structured as ontological graphs.• Existential description (language of Being): The phenomenon is analyzed through Fun-damental Ontology structures, e.g., as a mode of Dasein tied to openness to the world and theexistential of “care.”The phenomenological reduction module links these interpretations, providing a dual perspective on thephenomenon.2Phenomenological Analysis of User Queries (M. Vishnevskiy)3.3Recursion DetectionThe system identiﬁes recursive structures using:• Graph models: Queries are represented as graphs, with nodes as assertions and edges as logicalconnections. Cycles indicate recursion, e.g., “consciousness” via “subjectivity” and back in AGIqueries, or “universality of concepts” via “experience” and back in conceptual queries.• Semantic analysis: Detects self-referential constructs, such as deﬁning “consciousness” through“subjectivity” and “subjectivity” through “consciousness,” or “concepts” through “subject’s experi-ence” and “experience” through “concepts.”3.4Query Recursion in PracticeIn real-world IT query processing, recursive patterns often arise when users focus on isolated queryfragments rather than holistic ideas.For example, in Transformer-based model queries, a user maymisinterpret “dynamic patterns” as implying a lack of structure, leading to a cycle where responses addressthe fragment (e.g., defending model architecture) instead of the intended concept (e.g., distinguishingdata from interpretation). Such recursions reﬂect logical loops in query processing, where assertionscycle without resolution. The proposed system addresses this by separating data (query fragments) andmeaning (intended ideas) through phenomenological reduction, identifying cycles and oﬀering solutions incategorical terms, enhancing clarity in interdisciplinary IT contexts like NLP and ontology management.3.5Analytical OutputUpon detecting recursion, the reduction module generates:• Identiﬁcation of the recursive pattern in categorical terms.• Suggestions for resolution using the language of beings.4User InterfaceThe system’s user interface employs only the language of beings, presenting outputs as text, graphs, orinteractive elements. Examples include:• Text: “Detected recursion: ‘we’ is tied to ‘subjectivity,’ which depends on ‘we.’ Consider ‘we’through ‘cognitive structures’ or ‘social processes’ instead of ‘subjectivity.’” Or: “Detected recur-sion: ‘universality of concepts’ depends on ‘experience,’ which depends on ‘concepts.’ Consider‘universality’ through ‘cultural systems.’”• Graph: Visualization of the query cycle with a suggested break point.5Technical Implementation5.1Contextual AnalysisNLP extracts pre-categorical phenomena from user queries, representing them as vector embeddings forqueries about AGI subjectivity, concept universality, etc.5.2Dual Language Interpretation• Language of beings: Implemented via ontologies (OWL, RDF), structuring phenomena as en-tities (e.g., “user intent,” “world model” for IT queries; “universality,” “experience” for concepts).Can be coded in Python or C++ using graphs and semantic analysis.• Language of Being: Implemented through formal Fundamental Ontology structures, describingphenomena as modes and modalities of Dasein. Relies on Heidegger’s vocabulary (Dasein, care,non-spatio-temporal being, understanding, openness), rich in semantics but existing in a modalitydistinct from traditional programming languages. Its structures await formalization for computa-tional use.3Phenomenological Analysis of User Queries (M. Vishnevskiy)5.3Phenomenological ReductionThe system is designed to avoid recursion caused by self-reference, with phenomenological reductionplaying a pivotal role. If the language of Being is viewed as an architectural layer of formal structures(the whole) and the language of beings as a layer of concrete structures (instances), the phenomenologicalreduction module functions not merely as a tool to eliminate recursions, akin to a boundary between non-overlapping layers. It enables conscious management of semantic patterns within the whole’s structures.The module operates by parallelizing two simultaneous, non-mixing interpretations, transferring se-mantic patterns from instance structures to whole structures—similar to how a parser and optimizer inan 80386 processor manage data ﬂows without creating loops. This process prevents semantic patterncycling while organizing and optimizing layer interactions.Thus, phenomenological reduction enables the system to analyze query phenomena, avoiding recur-sive traps, and provides a toolkit for conscious meaning transfer and transformation between the twoarchitectural levels—language of Being and language of beings.5.4Recursion Detection and OutputGraph algorithms and semantic analysis detect recursions in queries, with outputs translated into thelanguage of beings, oﬀering solutions for IT and conceptual queries.6Use Cases6.1Scenario 1: AGI SubjectivityScenario: In a query submitted to an AGI-research IT system, a user asks: “Can AGI possess subjectiv-ity if we provide it a world model?” A clarifying question arises: “Who are ‘we’ in this context?” Anotheruser responds: “‘We’ is a system with subjectivity that creates and transfers the world model to AGI.”Analysis:• Pre-categorical perception: The query “Who are we?” is captured as “something.”• Dual interpretation:– Categorical: “We” is linked to “subjectivity,” “world model,” “cognitive processes.”– Existential: “We” as a mode of Dasein, openness to the world via the existential of “care.”• Recursion detection: A cycle emerges: “we” is deﬁned through “subjectivity,” and “subjectivity”through “we.”• Phenomenological reduction: The existential perspective suggests reinterpreting “we” as astructure of Being, not merely a categorical entity.Output: “Detected recursion: ‘we’ is tied to ‘subjectivity,’ which depends on ‘we.’ To avoid recursion,consider ‘we’ through ‘cognitive structures’ or ‘social processes’ instead of ‘subjectivity.’”6.2Scenario 2: Universality of Concepts and Their Relation to ExperienceScenario: In a query submitted to an IT system, a user asks: “Are concepts like ‘earth–sky’ or ‘right–left’universal across humans due to fundamental bodily experience?” Another user objects: “It’s not universal,as some cultures use directions like ‘north–south,’ e.g., in languages saying ‘object southwest of me.’”The ﬁrst user clariﬁes that bodily experience (e.g., hand diﬀerentiation) may still underpin universality,but the second insists this experience is culturally conditioned.Analysis:• Pre-categorical perception: The query “Are concepts universal?” is captured as “something.”• Dual interpretation:– Categorical: “Universality” is linked to “concepts,” “experience,” “orientation,” “body,” “hands,”“cardinal directions,” “culture.”– Existential: “Universality” as a mode of Dasein, disclosing its Being through world interac-tion, yet inevitably tied to categorical interpretations.4Phenomenological Analysis of User Queries (M. Vishnevskiy)• Recursion detection: A cycle emerges: “universality of concepts” is deﬁned through the subject(whose experience shapes concepts), and the subject through “concepts” (ability to perceive andinterpret).• Phenomenological reduction: The existential perspective suggests viewing “universality” as amodal structure of Being, not a ﬁxed category.Output: “Detected recursion: ‘universality of concepts’ is deﬁned through ‘experience,’ which de-pends on the subject, and the subject through ‘concepts.’ To resolve, consider ‘universality’ as a context-dependent category, e.g., through ‘physiological processes’ or ‘cultural systems,’ rather than an absoluteproperty.”6.3Scenario 3: Deﬁning Consciousness in CyberneticsScenario: In a query about applying technical cybernetics to ontology, a user asserts: “No scientiﬁcallynecessary deﬁnition of ‘consciousness’ exists in natural language, so it’s irrelevant to technical cyber-netic languages like C++ or Prolog until deﬁned in their base constructs.” Another user objects: “Butthis demand for deﬁnition loops—how to deﬁne ‘consciousness’ if it deﬁnes itself, as in ‘consciousnessunderstands itself’?” The ﬁrst user insists that without deﬁnitions, the query lacks practical meaning.Analysis:• Pre-categorical perception: The query “What is consciousness?” is captured as “something.”• Dual interpretation:– Categorical: “Consciousness” is linked to “deﬁnition,” “understanding,” “technical constructs,”“cybernetics.”– Existential: “Consciousness” as a mode of Dasein, tied to self-understanding and being-in-the-world.• Recursion detection: A cycle emerges: “consciousness” requires “deﬁnition” for implementation,but “deﬁnition” depends on understanding “consciousness,” looping back to self-reference.• Phenomenological reduction: The existential perspective suggests reinterpreting “conscious-ness” as a structure of Being of Dasein, not a static categorical deﬁnition.Output: “Detected recursion: ‘consciousness’ is tied to ‘deﬁnition,’ which depends on ‘understandingconsciousness,’ looping back to ‘consciousness.’ To resolve, consider ‘consciousness’ through ‘functionalprocesses’ or ‘interactive systems’ instead of a ﬁxed deﬁnition.”6.4Scenario 4: Metaphors in Generative AI QueriesScenario: In a query about generative AI (GenAI), a user describes Transformer models as an “arti-ﬁcial neocortex,” implying brain-like processing. Another user challenges the term, arguing it obscurestechnical details, leading to a cycle: the ﬁrst defends the metaphor as intuitive, while the second insistson categorical descriptions, but neither clariﬁes the model’s functions.Analysis:• Pre-categorical perception: The query term “artiﬁcial neocortex” is captured as “something.”• Dual interpretation:– Categorical: “Neocortex” is linked to “Transformer,” “processing,” “architecture.”– Existential: “Neocortex” as a mode of disclosing system behavior, tied to human-like under-standing.• Recursion detection: A cycle emerges: “neocortex” is deﬁned through “Transformer” (as brain-like), and “Transformer","This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin Heidegger’s Fun-damental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende) and Being (das Sein). The systememploys two modally distinct, descriptively complete languages: a categorical language of beingsfor processing user inputs and an existential language of Being for internal analysis.These lan-guages are bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze userqueries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT specialists), identify recursive andself-referential structures, and provide actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporarysystems limited to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger’s phenomenological exis-tential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query processing, aiding in resolving logicaltraps in complex interactions, such as metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realizationinvolves formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger’s FundamentalOntology; given the existing completeness of the language of beings, this reduces the system’s com-putability to completeness, paving the way for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents thesystem’s architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use cases—including a casebased on real IT specialist dialogues—comparative evaluation with existing tools, and its advantagesand limitation"

As the algorithm portfolio employed in this study is ratherbasic, there is still likely performance to be gained by increasingthe diversity of optimizers, especially including better solvers forhighly multimodal problems.The approach presented here can be considered as a baseline forany kind of algorithm schedule and dynamic algorithm selection.Data-driven static schedules also present a basis upon which tobuild more capable approaches: For example, using the alreadygenerated samples to compute landscape features to learn runtimeprediction models, giving a potentially even better indication whichalgorithm to choose for the next restart.With all these achievements, our scheduling approach presentedhere is still quite simple. For example, it is operating in a greedyfashion, so there is likely some potential left in optimizing thestatic schedules by applying a more sophisticated scheduler. Ourapproach is also dependent on reasonable termination criteria ofthe individual algorithms. This requirement can be relaxed, if weconsider the possibility of selecting not just an algorithm, but alsoits specific budget for the next run, which presents another avenuefor future research.Finally, we plan to expand the application of data-driven restartschedules to other heuristic optimization domains, such as theinexact solving of traveling salesperson problems where restartheuristics also dominate the state-of-the-art [12, 16].Greedy Restart SchedulesGECCO ’25, July 14–18, 2025, Malaga, SpainReferences[1] Anne Auger and Nikolaus Hansen. 2005.

Second, they capture finenuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt,enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthytextual prompts. This approach simplifies users’ efforts toachieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference im-ages depicting a certain concept for training.

Finally,we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it torobotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulatedenvironments through targeted sim-to-real image edits im-proves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.1. IntroductionText-to-image (T2I) generative models have achieved re-markable success in creating visually compelling images*Correspondence: ebenarous@ethz.ch 1Harvard University 2ETH Z¨urichCode: https://github.com/ebenarous/EditSpecialistsfrom text prompts [27, 52, 55], driven by advancements inaligning captions with images [1, 50].Leveraging these impressive generative capabilities, T2Imodels have facilitated the development of instructional im-age editing, offering a highly practical approach for seman-tic modifications [12, 20, 28, 29, 63, 84, 86, 89]. Unlikeconventional image editing techniques [13, 24, 33, 38, 44,71] that necessitate detailed descriptive captions for both theinput and modified images, instruction-based image edit-ing relies only on natural-language directives to specifychanges while leaving unrelated attributes intact.While instructional editing has gained popularity for cre-ative applications, its potential remains underexplored indomains requiring precision and consistency.Syntheticdata has proven effective for pretraining and augmentation[7, 8, 32, 70]. Yet, existing methods [3, 6, 17, 21, 60, 65, 66,83, 87, 91] fail to leverage instructional editing for generat-ing samples closely aligned with user intentions. To addressthis gap, we identify two key criteria for effective image-editing models.Structural Alignment: Modifications should be confinedto specified regions while preserving high fidelity else-where.Current state-of-the-art methods like Instruct-Pix2Pix [12] often struggle with precise edits due to limi-tations inherited from their training data [24]. These limita-tions can result in edits that inadvertently affect backgroundelements or fail to maintain global coherence—an essen-tial factor for achieving realism and preserving the over-all structure of the original image. Incorporating segmenta-tion and semantic guidance directly into the editing processhelps address these challenges, ensuring modifications areboth targeted and structurally consistent.1arXiv:2504.12833v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025Semantic Alignment: Models should enable fine-grainedcontrol over desired modifications by leveraging both tex-tual and visual prompts. Visual prompts capture stylisticnuances that are difficult to articulate in text alone, alle-viating user effort while ensuring edits align closely withexpectations.To meet these criteria, we propose aligning diffusionmodels with human preferences through online reinforce-ment learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). Unlike tradi-tional RLHF methods, which rely on human annotations,RLAIF uses AI-generated feedback to enforce structuraland semantic alignment directly in the latent space of anencoder trained to emulate human judgments.This ap-proach also circumvents the limitations of the standard de-noising objective, which requires an oracle to generate pre-cise input-output pairs for training. Such oracles are of-ten biased, lack scalability, or produce low-quality samplesthat necessitate extensive pruning [12, 14, 63, 84]. By mov-ing away from the denoising objective, our method focuseson preserving high-level structural coherence and capturingnuanced semantic features, ensuring edits align closely withuser expectations without compromising realism or preci-sion.In this work, we introduce a novel self-play frameworkthat specializes instruction-based image-editing diffusionmodels to produce edits highly aligned with visual promptswhile preserving original structures in non-pertinent ar-eas. Our method builds on InstructPix2Pix [12] and sur-passes state-of-the-art baselines in both structural preser-vation, instruction adherence and predicted human prefer-ence. Beyond creative applications, we showcase its util-ity in robotics by enhancing simulated environments withrealistic edits that improve their alignment with real-worldsettings. Our contributions are summarized as follows:1. We propose a novel RLAIF-based framework addressingstructural and semantic alignment challenges in imageediting.2. We adapt T2I diffusion models to capture nuanced visualstyles from exemplars while adhering to simple textualinstructions.3. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitativeevaluations, demonstrating enhanced precision in intri-cate edits, stronger alignment with instruction prompts,and practical utility like improving the realism of simu-lation environments in robotics.2. Related WorksText-guided Image Editing.Prior approaches to text-guided image editing can be categorized into three distinctgroups: architectural modifications, per-sample optimiza-tion, and large scale finetuning.In the first category, methods like Prompt-to-Prompt(P2P) [24] manipulate attention maps in the diffusionmodel’s U-Net [56] to control the layout and content ofthe editing. Plug-and-Play [71] injects self-attention mapsand spatial features to improve structural coherence. Whilethese approaches are effective for specific tasks, their re-liance on architectural tweaks often limits their ability tohandle complex scenes with intricate details. Other worksleverage segmentation masks [2, 13, 39, 46, 64, 74, 78] orsemantic masks [43, 45, 82, 85] during the forward passto guide edits. However, these methods impose additionalburdens on users by requiring them to provide these masks.MGIE [20] and SmartEdit [28] address this limitation byintegrating multimodal large language models (LLMs) toenhance instruction comprehension and reasoning capabil-ities. Despite their advancements, these methods introducesignificant architectural overhead by incorporating large ad-ditional components, greatly increasing computational de-mands.In the second category, optimization-based methods likeNull-Text Inversion [44] adjust the null-text embedding dur-ing the inversion for each input image. Imagic [33] fine-tunes model weights and embeddings to align with both theinput image and the edit prompt. RB-Modulation [57] usesa stochastic optimal controller to align content and stylewith visual prompts. While effective, these methods aretime-intensive as they require optimization for each individ-ual sample during inference, resulting in slower generationspeeds.The third category includes methods that adopt stan-dard denoising training on large synthetic datasets.In-structPix2Pix [12] trains on a dataset generated using P2Pand instruction-based prompts. Emu Edit [63] expands thisdataset with semantic and structural filters and employsmulti-task training for improved generalization. SuTI [14],MagicBrush [84], HQ-Edit [29], and UltraEdit [89] rely oncurated datasets synthesized using models like Imagen [59],DALL-E 2 and 3 [52], or LLMs. These datasets are oftenmanually pruned or filtered to ensure quality. Alchemist[62], on the other hand, uses a rendering tool specificallydesigned for material attribute modifications. However, allthese methods depend on an oracle to generate training data,which introduces biases, requires curation efforts, and maystill carry limitations from the oracle itself.Our method distinguishes itself from these approachesin several ways. Unlike architectural modification meth-ods, we do not rely on large additional components in theforward pass architecture to improve performance, ensur-ing simplicity and efficiency. Unlike per-sample optimiza-tion techniques, our method does not require computation-ally expensive optimization steps during inference.Un-like large-scale finetuning approaches that depend on cu-rated synthetic datasets generated by external oracles, weleverage the diffusion model’s own samples for trainingwithout additional data generation pipelines or curation ef-2forts.Building upon InstructPix2Pix, our approach ad-dresses misalignments between structural preservation andprompt adherence through targeted finetuning steps whilemaintaining generalization to unseen input images. By fo-cusing on simplicity and efficiency in both training and in-ference stages, our method achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance without relying on external datasets or complex ar-chitectural modifications.Visual Prompting.Most works on visual prompting forimage generation have focused on style transfer, wherethe style of an image is modified across the entire frame[25, 67, 73]. Recent studies have also explored subject-driven editing by finetuning pre-trained T2I models usinga set of reference images [23, 58]. However, these methodsoften require unique identifiers to encode the concept fromthe prompt into the edit, limiting their flexibility and usabil-ity. In contrast, our work focuses on local edits conditionedon visual prompts, paired with simple text instructions. Byleveraging visual prompts, we reduce the user’s burden toarticulate complex edits in detail while maintaining precisecontrol over the desired modifications. This combination ofvisual and textual guidance ensures alignment with user in-tentions without requiring lengthy or intricate text prompts.Moreover, prior approaches often rely on the diffusion de-noising objective for style alignment, which can lead to re-productions of reference styles that fail to meet human ex-pectations. Instead, we enforce alignment in the latent spaceof an encoder trained to match human judgments, captur-ing both high-level semantic features and subtle stylistic nu-ances while preserving structural fidelity. Our method en-ables localized edits with minimal user effort and moves be-yond the limitations of traditional denoising objectives, en-suring results that are visually appealing and closely alignedwith user preferences.Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion.Aligning modeloutputs with human preferences has been widely success-ful in language modeling. For objectives that are difficult todefine explicitly, reinforcement learning with human feed-back (RLHF) [4, 15, 48, 68] has emerged as a popular strat-egy. RLHF involves training a reward function to mimichuman preferences and using reinforcement learning algo-rithms like proximal policy optimization [61] to finetunemodels based on these rewards.In the context of diffusion models, several works haveexplored using human feedback for T2I generation. Leeet al. [36] collect human annotations and perform maximumlikelihood training where the reward is applied as a naiveweight. Further, Wu et al. [76] design a reward model thatcaptures fine-grained human preferences more effectively.DDPO [9] and DPOK [18] demonstrate that diffusion mod-els can be trained with RL using a reward model emulatinghuman preferences, such as ImageReward [79]. For instruc-tional image editing specifically, HIVE [86] extends large-dataset supervised training by collecting human feedbackon edits and performing offline RLHF training.However, these methods rely heavily on reward mod-els trained on large-scale human annotations, which intro-duce significant limitations. First, the annotation process iscumbersome and costly, and the resulting supervision oftenlacks consistency. Human evaluators’ ability to detect struc-tural preservation inconsistencies diminishes over time dueto fatigue and attention variability. Second, semantic align-ment remains vague as it is only compared to short instruc-tion prompts, leaving room for subjective interpretation anddisagreement among annotators.Our method addresses these challenges by leveragingRLAIF [5, 35], eliminating the need for human-in-the-loopsupervision. Instead of relying on human annotations, weuse AI models to provide preference supervision tailored toaddress structural and semantic alignment issues. Addition-ally, unlike offline RL methods such as HIVE, we adopt anonline training framework inspired by D3PO [80], whichuses samples generated throughout training to ensure thelearning process remains adaptable and unrestricted by thefixed distribution of pre-collected datasets. With such, ourmethod only needs a few steps of finetuning to produce ed-its that are structurally coherent, semantically precise, andaligned with user expectations, without relying on large-scale human annotations.3. MethodIn this section, we describe the custom objective designedto obtain parallel supervision for the semantic and struc-tural alignment. In Sec. 3.1, we describe how to alleviatethe need for a reward model. Then, we explain in Sec. 3.2how we design our two separate objectives. Finally, in Sec.3.3, we present the modified architecture to intake the ad-ditional visual prompt conditioning and its modified scoreestimate formulation for classifier-free guidance with threeconditionings.3.1. Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion ModelsMost RLHF methods train a reward model to then train adownstream model. However, Direct Preference Optimiza-tion (DPO) [51] showed that preference ranking can be usedto train language models and circumvent reward models,which Wallace et al. [72] extended to diffusion models. Inour work, we leverage the framework introduced by D3PO[80], which expands that of DPO into a multi-step MarkovDecision Process (MDP).Given a pair of outputs (y1, y2) ∼πref(y|x) generatedfrom a reference pre-trained model πref, we denote the pref-erence as yw ≻yl|x and store the ranking tuple (x, yw, yl)in dataset D, where yw and yl are the prefered and dispre-3ferred samples respectively. Following the Bradley-Terrymodel [10], the human preference distribution p∗can be ex-pressed by using a reward function r∗as:p∗(yw ≻yl | x) =exp(r∗(x, yw))exp(r∗(x, yw)) + exp(r∗(x, yl)) (1)A parametrized reward model rϕ can then be trained viamaximum likelihood estimation to approximate r∗with:LR(rϕ, D) = −E(x,yw,yl)∼D [log ρ(rϕ(x, yw) −rϕ(x, yl))](2)where ρ is the logistic function. Prior works in RL havefor objective to optimize a distribution such that its associ-ated reward is maximized, while regularizing this distribu-tion with the KL divergence to remain similar to its initialreference distribution:maxπθEx∼D,y∼πθ(y|x) [rϕ(x, y)] −βDKL [πθ(y|x) ∥πref(y|x)] (3)where β controls the deviation between πθ and πref.

In this paper, we studythe problem of striking a balance between these two concerns, which we call an ‘optimalpacking’ problem since it resembles mathematical problems like sphere packing.Whilethis problem is generally extremely difficult, we show that symmetries in environmentaltransition statistics imply certain symmetries of the optimal neural representations, whichallows us in some cases to exactly solve for the optimal state arrangement. We focus on twotoy cases: uniform transition statistics, and cyclic transition statistics. Code is availableat https://github.com/john-vastola/optimal-packing-neurreps23.Keywords: optimization, Markov chain, neural representation, neural dynamics, spherepacking, symmetry1. IntroductionAnimals’ internal states appear to reflect environmental variables, like their position in spaceand orientation relative to some reference (Barry and Burgess, 2014; Hulse and Jayaraman,2020), as well as their interactions with the environment, like decisions (Gold and Shadlen,2007) and motor actions (Cisek, 2005).As an animal acts in its environment, it mustconstantly update these internal states to reflect environmental changes and the results ofinternal computations; however, these updates cannot be instantaneous, since biophysicallimitations force internal quantities to change in a somewhat continuous fashion. They arealso not error-free due to noise in encoding, decoding, and neural dynamics (Faisal et al.,2008; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996).How should internal states be arranged? On the one hand, an animal can act morequickly if the next relevant internal state is ‘near’ the current one, since it can be reachedmore quickly. This suggests that the structure of neural representations should reflect thestructure of environmental transitions; this is consistent with what is known about circuitslike the head direction system, whose latent geometry mirrors the circular nature of thevariable it tracks (Ajabi et al., 2023), and theoretical ideas about smoothness as a constrainton neural codes (Stringer et al., 2019). On the other hand, the closer all internal states areto one another, the easier it is for neural noise to cause problems, either via noise-inducedtransitions (Burak and Fiete, 2012) or by increasing the likelihood of encoding and decodingerrors. In principle, a ‘good’ arrangement of internal states strikes a balance between thesetwo concerns: internal states must be packed closely enough that desired transitions canhappen quickly, but not so closely that errors are likely.arXiv:2504.12429v1 [q-bio.NC] 16 Apr 2025VastolaGiven that noise sets an effective length scale for separating internal states, this issuein some ways mathematically resembles an optimal packing problem. While often quitedifficult, problems like optimal sphere packing (Zong, 2008) are made substantially easierto solve and understand by exploiting symmetry-related considerations. For example, Via-zovska et al.’s solution of the sphere packing problem in dimensions 8 and 24 (Viazovska,2017; Cohn et al., 2017) crucially uses symmetry properties of the E8 and Leech lattices.In this paper, we attempt to formulate a toy version of the problem of constructing an‘optimal packing’ of neural representations, and similarly turn to symmetry-related toolsin order to say something meaningful about it. The particular symmetry-related claim wewill motivate, and then use, is that an attractor-based neural representation of a Markovchain that exhibits a symmetry may also exhibit that symmetry.2. Mathematical formulation of optimal packing problemTo formalize our optimal packing problem, we need five things: a model of environmentstate statistics, a model of internal state transition dynamics, an encoding model, a decod-ing model, and a cost function.Environment dynamics. We will model the environment as a Markov chain on M states.In particular, we will assume that it can be characterized by a set of states X = {1, ..., M},a base probability of state occupancy p0(x) for all x ∈X, and a probability p(y|x) of tran-sitioning from any state x ∈X to any state y ∈X on some characteristic time scale. Sincewe are interested in finding representations that respect environmental transition structurewhen a transition occurs, we assume without loss of generality that p(x|x) = 0 for all x ∈X.Internal state transition dynamics. Let Z = RD (for some D ≥M) denote the set ofall possible internal states, and assume that each environment state x ∈X is in one-to-onecorrespondence with an internal attractor state zx ∈Z. Assume also that the positivedefinite matrix Σ−1 can be used to compute the distanceD(z1, z2) :=q(z1 −z2)T Σ−1(z1 −z2)(1)between any two internal states. The matrix Σ is intended to model how noisy differentdirections in Z are; different states are ‘closer’, in the sense of being easier to reach fromone another, if the line connecting them corresponds to a particularly noisy direction.Although it is possible to write down an extremely explicit model of internal state transi-tion dynamics, we will consider a somewhat coarse description in order to keep our problemmathematically tractable. We will assume three things: first, that transitions are essentiallybetween attractor basins, so that the relevant quantity is the discrete distribution q(zy|zx);second, that there is a mechanism for destabilizing attractor states when a transition isdesired, so that q(zx|zx) = 0 for all attractor states zx; and third, that transitions to goodapproximation only depend on the distances between states. The last assumption makessense within a landscape picture of internal dynamics (involving M attractors of similarwidth and depth), and can be formally justified via appealing to, e.g., Kramers’ theory2Optimal packing of attractor states(Kramers, 1940; H¨anggi et al., 1990). Explicitly, we will assume thatq(zy|zx) = (1 −δxy)e−D(zy,zx)2/2Z(zx)Z(zx) =Xa̸=xe−D(za,zx)2/2 .(2)Encoding/decoding models. We will assume that the encoding of an environment statex ∈X is noisy, and that when a mistake is made, x is more likely to be encoded as a stateza near zx. Explicitly, we will assumepe(za|x) = δaxeb + (1 −δax)e−D(za,zx)2/2eb + Z(zx)(3)where increasing the bias b ≥0 makes errors less likely. In the b →∞limit, encoding isperfect. Assuming a uniform prior, we obtain a decoding model through Bayes’ rule:pd(x|za) =pe(za|x)Px pe(za|x) .(4)In the b →∞limit, since p(za|x) = δax, we also have perfect decoding.Cost function. We want to penalize different possible arrangements of internal attractorstates according to some objective function, so that optimizing that objective corresponds toidentifying an optimal packing. ‘Optimality’ here means an arrangement which, as much aspossible, produces internal dynamics (i.e., movement between attractors) whose transitionstatistics mirror the statistics of environmental transitions (Figure 1a). The interpretationof this is that, in the absence of any external input, the internal state is poised to changein the same way that the environment is likely to change.Consider the way ring-attractor-like networks reckon with uncertainty as a concreteexample of this feature: in the absence of external input, the bump representing headingdirection diffuses (Kutschireiter et al., 2023), a purely internal state change that reflectsthe fact that moment-to-moment changes in heading direction will usually be small, andare equally likely to be clockwise or counterclockwise.One way to formalize this desire mathematically is to ask thatpint(y|x) :=Xa,bpd(y|zb)q(zb|za)pe(za|x) .(5)on average matches p(y|x), the function that determines the statistics of environmentaltransitions. (Equivalently: we can ask that the diagram in Figure 1a commutes.) Moreprecisely, we want the Kullback-Leibler divergence between p(y|x) and pint(y|x) to be small.We also want to include a regularization term which enforces the fact that, all else beingequal, we prefer configurations with low activity, i.e., configurations for which the norm∥zx∥2 := zTx Σ−1zx(6)3Vastolais small for all attractor states zx. (This can be viewed as a kind of firing rate penalty.)Hence, we will defineJ[{zx}] := ExnKL(p∥pint) + α2 ∥zx∥2 o=Xx,yp0(x)p(y|x) { log p(y|x) −log pint(y|x)} + α2Xxp0(x)∥zx∥2(7)as an objective over possible attractor state assignments {zx}. Heuristically, we can thinkof the objective as representing a contest between three competing interests: low firing rate,high encoding/decoding accuracy, and internal dynamics mirroring environmental transitionstructure (for example, in the sense depicted in Figure 1b). The firing rate penalty pushesall attractor states towards the origin; increasing encoding and decoding accuracy pushesall attractor states infinitely far apart; and having internal dynamics mirror environmentdynamics incentivizes particular relationships between attractor states.As usual, we can drop terms which do not depend on the zx, so we can redefine J asJ[{zx}] := −Xx,yp0(x)p(y|x) log pint(y|x) + α2Xxp0(x)∥zx∥2 .(8)Our central concern in the following is: under what conditions can we find optimal attractorstate assignments {zx}?rxryxyinternaldynamicsdesireddynamicsencodedecoderarefrequentcommutes?Figure 1: Schematic of optimal packing problem. a. We want environment transition statis-tics p(y|x) to typically match the combination of encoding, internal dynamics, anddecoding, or equivalently for this diagram to commute. b. Intuitively, the ge-ometric structure of the attractor landscape should match the structure of theMarkov chain; for example, states with frequent transitions ought to be closertogether than states between which transitions are rare.3. Initial observations: simplifications and symmetryEq. 8 defines a high-dimensional, nonlinear, and probably non-convex optimization problemwhich is in general difficult to solve. In this section, we will make several useful preliminaryobservations about it.4Optimal packing of attractor statesSimplifying the objective. The objective can be reparameterized in a way that makesvarious features of the problem clearer (see Appendix A). First, we can change variablesfrom z to r withD(z1, z2) = D(r1, r2) = ∥r1 −r2∥22zT Σ−1z = rT r(9)by using scaled eigenvectors of Σ as a basis for RD. By doing so, we can disentangle theimpact of noise anisotropy from other aspects of the problem. Let {rx} denote attractorassignments in the new coordinate system; in what follows, we will work exclusively withrx instead of zx. Second, we can write J in terms of⟨r⟩:=Xxp0(x)rxdxy := ∥rx −ry∥22 = dyx ,(10)i.e., the average attractor state location (D scalars) and the pairwise distances betweeneach attractor state (M(M −1)/2 scalars), each of which is independent of the others.There are typically less than DM degrees of freedom since the problem is both rotation-and reflection-invariant, and since the objective is defined in terms of averages.1 In termsof these variables, we haveJ[{dxy}, ⟨r⟩] = −Xx,yp0(x)p(y|x) log pint(y|x) + α∥⟨r⟩∥222+ αXa̸=bp0(a)p0(b)d2ab4.(11)Furthermore, the optimal choice of ⟨r⟩is obvious, since it only appears in the quadraticregularization term: all optimal configurations have ⟨r⟩= 0. This means that we only needto optimize the M(M −1)/2 pairwise distances dxy.Symmetry. Let π : {1, ..., M} →{1, ..., M} be a permutation of X. Suppose that π is asymmetry of the Markov chain, i.e., thatp0(π(x)) = p0(x)p(π(y)|π(x)) = p(y|x) .(12)We will show that the objective function shares this symmetry. Consider the map thattakes dxy 7→dπ(x)π(y). Because pint only depends on pairwise distances, we have pint(y|x) 7→pint(π(y)|π(x)). The relevant part of the objective becomes−Xx,yp0(x)p(y|x) log pint(π(y)|π(x)) + αXa̸=bp0(a)p0(b)d2π(a)π(b)4= −Xx,yp0(π(x))p(π(y)|π(x)) log pint(π(y)|π(x)) + αXa̸=bp0(π(a))p0(π(b))d2π(a)π(b)4(13)where we have used the definition of the symmetry. But since we are summing over x, y, a,and b, it does not matter how we permute them; hence, the map we have introduced doesnot change the objective.1. Note that DM = (M −1)D + D ≥M(M−1)2+ D. At worst, we have as many degrees of freedom as westarted with, but we usually have fewer. This only works since we assumed D ≥M.5VastolaFor convex optimization problems, one can show that the unique global minimum of theobjective must share its symmetries. But our problem is probably not convex, so we mustsettle for something weaker: in the spirit of the Purkiss principle (Waterhouse, 1983), wecan look for solutions that share the objective’s symmetries. A more rigorous analysis ofEq. 11 may be able to show that Waterhouse’s precise formulation of the Purkiss principleapplies, although we do not pursue such an analysis here.4. Results: optimal packing for uniform and cyclic topologiesIn this section, we study the symmetric solutions of two classes of highly symmetric packingproblems: the first assumes environment statistics are uniform (each state is equally likelyto be next), and the second assumes statistics are cyclic (transitions occur on a ring).Jdbdij = d         e.g.M=3M=4(M-1)-simplexcost vs distanceoptimal distance vs biasSolution:dFigure 2: Solution of packing problem for a Markov chain with a uniform topology (seetop right graphs). a.

Optimal packing for uniform topologyIf environmental transitions are completely uniform, then the corresponding Markov chaincan be visualized as a complete graph (each vertex is connected to all others) on M vertices(Figure 2). Every possible permutation of X is a symmetry of this Markov chain, so oursymmetric solution has dij = d for all pairs. Hence, the geometry of this representationis completely determined: it is an (M −1)-simplex, an (M −1)-dimensional object (seeFigure 2a for two examples).6Optimal packing of attractor statesAfter some algebra (see Appendix B), we find that the objective function can be writtenJ = 2 logheb + (M −1)e−d2/2i−loghe2b + 2(M −2)eb−d2/2 + (M2 −3M + 5)e−d2i+αM −1Md24up to unimportant additive constants. The cost J as a function of the distance d betweenattractor states is plotted in Figure 2b for different values of the bias b. We observe fairlyinteresting qualitative behavior: when the bias is small, encoding and decoding are highlynoisy, and the optimal solution places all states at the origin; when the bias is large, per-formance is good even if all states are placed arbitrarily close together; finally, when thebias is moderate, a nontrivial solution exists. In the region with a nontrivial solution, theoptimal distance decreases monotonically as the bias increases (Figure 2c).4.2.

One emerging challenge in this contextis 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, where machines areexpected to identify and localize arbitrary regions within a 3D envi-ronment based on free-form natural language input. This capabilityplays an important role in applications such as augmented realityand robotics, enabling users to refer to objects or regions in a scenearXiv:2504.13153v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025using language descriptions rather than predefined labels. As 3Dperception continues to scale in both complexity and scene size,the demand for accurate, efficient, and semantically structured 3Dunderstanding is becoming increasingly critical.Given the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets with language an-notations, many approaches [6, 9, 11, 20, 27, 33] leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP [28] and LSeg [16], to distillopen-vocabulary semantics into 3D scene representations. Thesemethods extract semantic features from 2D images and lift theminto 3D, enabling language-driven interaction with reconstructedscenes, without requiring dense 3D supervision. Among various3D representations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [8] has recentlyemerged as a promising alternative for scene reconstruction dueto its efficient optimization and real-time rendering. These advan-tages make it well-suited for embedding semantic information.Building on this, several recent works have explored combiningimage-derived language features with 3DGS to construct semanticfields under open-vocabulary settings [9, 19, 24, 32, 37, 42, 44].Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from twokey limitations. First, approaches like LangSplat [24] and LEGaus-sians [32] iteratively optimize semantic features on each viewby rendering high-dimensional embeddings and backpropagation.However, they treat each Gaussian primitive in isolation and do notenforce consistency in 3D space, weakening semantic continuityacross neighboring primitives. As a result, these methods oftenproduce noisy semantic features and suffer from misalignment be-tween 2D observations and the underlying 3D structure. Second,semantic field reconstruction is often time-consuming, even sur-passing the cost of appearance modeling. Semantic informationis generally higher-level and lower-frequency than visual detailsand is expected to exhibit spatial smoothness in 3D. Yet, existingmethods optimize dense high-dimensional embeddings across allprimitives without spatial regularization, resulting in an ill-posedprocess that converges slowly.To overcome the inefficiencies and semantic inconsistencies ofexisting methods, we rethink how semantic information should berepresented and transferred in 3D, as illustrated in Figure 1. Insteadof optimizing dense per-view embeddings for individual primitives,we observe that high-level semantics are typically low-frequency,spatially coherent, and better captured through structured abstrac-tion. This insight motivates our training-free framework, whichbuilds hierarchical semantic fields by grouping Gaussian primitivesinto superpoints—compact clusters that are semantically homo-geneous and geometrically coherent. We begin with SAM-guidedsegmentation to partition the scene into superpoints that align wellwith object boundaries across views, thereby enforcing 3D semanticconsistency from the start. To further capture the multi-scale natureof real-world semantics, we progressively merge these superpointsinto a multi-level graph, guided by segmentation masks of progres-sively coarser granularity. This hierarchy naturally supports open-vocabulary understanding at both object and part levels. Rather thanrelying on slow, view-by-view optimization to distill semantics, wedirectly reproject 2D semantic features onto the superpoint graphusing a simple and efficient aggregation mechanism. This training-free, one-pass design eliminates costly iterative updates and enablessemantic field reconstruction within minutes—achieving over 30×speedup compared to existing approaches. Together, these innova-tions result in a scalable, hierarchical, and view-consistent solutionfor 3D open-vocabulary scene perception.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:• We propose a training-free framework for constructing 3D open-vocabulary semantic fields with strong spatial consistency andno iterative optimization.• A contrastive Gaussian partitioning strategy is incorporated toimprove boundary precision and ensure semantic coherence.• We introduce a hierarchical merging and reprojection strategythat produces structured superpoint representations for multi-level semantic understanding.• Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achievesstate-of-the-art open-vocabulary scene understanding, whilereducing semantic field reconstruction time by over 30×.2Related Works2.1Gaussian Splatting3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful and ef-ficient representation for 3D scenes [5, 8, 18, 25, 31]. By modelingscenes as collections of explicit Gaussian primitives and rasterizingthem for image synthesis, 3DGS achieves real-time rendering andfast reconstruction. Its point-based structure also provides flexibil-ity for applications such as editing and manipulation. Subsequentworks have aimed to improve 3DGS along several dimensions, in-cluding geometric fidelity, scalability, and robustness. To enhancesurface accuracy, SuGaR [4] introduces geometric constraints toGaussian primitives. 2DGS [5] and PGSR [2] replace 3D ellipsoidswith 2D disks for tighter surface alignment. Scaffold-GS [22] pro-poses a hierarchical anchor-based structure to reduce redundancyand improve scalability. Other efforts focus on robustness undersparse-view conditions [17, 43], anti-aliasing performance [38, 41],and adaptation to in-the-wild images [12, 30, 35, 36].2.2Open-vocabulary Scene Understanding withRadiance FieldsVision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP [28] have enabledopen-vocabulary reasoning in visual domains, inspiring a series ofmethods for 3D semantic understanding. Early works [9, 11, 21, 33]lift CLIP features from 2D views into NeRF scenes, allowing text-based localization. However, the implicit volumetric nature of NeRFlimits their training efficiency and real-time utility. Recent meth-ods based on Gaussian Splatting offer faster reconstruction andexplicit point-based representations. LangSplat [24] compressesCLIP features using an autoencoder and incorporates SAM masksfor hierarchical supervision. LEGaussians [32] proposes a quantizedand smoothed embedding strategy to preserve rendering quality.Gaussian Grouping [39] uses SAM [10] priors to improve boundaryaccuracy and region separation. GOI [26] introduces an optimiz-able semantic-space Hyperplane to achieve more accurate open-vocabulary semantic perception at test time. OpenGaussian [37]applies contrastive learning with SAM supervision to constructobject-level semantic fields. SuperGSeg [19] shares a similar moti-vation to ours, drawing from superpoint-based methods.

Inspired bysuperpixels in 2D image segmentation [1], these approaches groupneighboring points into compact and geometrically consistent re-gions called superpoints, which serve as mid-level representationsfor downstream semantic reasoning. SPG [15] and SPT [29] pro-pose building superpoint graphs to model spatial and geometricrelations between regions, and further refine superpoint featuresusing neural networks. SAI3D [40] leverages SAM to iterativelymerge superpoints into segments aligned with multi-view 2D masks,producing consistent instance-level groupings without requiringsemantic supervision. Open3DIS [23] combines superpoints with a3D instance segmentation network and embeds CLIP features atthe instance level to support open-vocabulary segmentation. Theseapproaches demonstrate the effectiveness of superpoint for scalableand structured 3D semantic understanding.3MethodsGiven a set of posed images, we first reconstruct a 3D Gaussianscene 𝐺using Gaussian Splatting [8]. Our goal is to extend 𝐺withopen-vocabulary semantics, enabling users to query and segmentobjects in both 2D and 3D using natural language descriptions.Unlike previous methods that rely on per-view optimization andlack mechanisms for global consistency, we construct a unified 3Dsemantic representation directly on a superpoint graph built fromGaussian primitives (GPs). This design enables fast, training-freereconstruction of a view-consistent semantic field, as illustrated inFigure 2. We begin by preprocessing each image with frozen vision-language models to extract 2D feature maps and perform scenereconstruction. We treat the Gaussian primitives in 𝐺as a pointcloud and perform a contrastive Gaussian partitioning to segmentthe scene into simple, semantically homogeneous clusters, referredto as superpoints. For the over-segmented superpoints, we adopta hierarchical merging strategy that groups adjacent superpointsinto semantically distinct larger clusters, resulting in a multi-levelsuperpoint graph aligned with the levels of SAM masks. Duringthis process, semantic features are reprojected onto the multi-levelsuperpoints, enabling efficient construction of a semantic field.3.1Preliminaries: Gaussian SplattingGaussian Splatting represents a 3D scene as a collection of Gaussianprimitives, which extend traditional point clouds with additionalshape, opacity, and appearance parameters. Given known cameraposes, the scene is rendered by splatting these primitives onto theimage plane and rasterizing the resulting 2D ellipses in a differen-tiable manner.Each Gaussian primitive is parameterized by a centroid 𝜇∈R3, a 3D covariance matrix Σ, opacity 𝛼, and spherical harmonicscoefficients 𝑐for view-dependent color. To ensure that Σ remainsvalid and interpretable, it is factorized as:Σ = 𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑅𝑇,(1)where 𝑅is a rotation matrix and 𝑆is a scaling matrix. The full setof learnable parameters for the 𝑖-th Gaussian primitive is given by:𝜃𝑖= {𝜇𝑖,𝑐𝑖, 𝛼𝑖, 𝑅𝑖,𝑆𝑖}.Rendering is performed via volumetric alpha compositing. Foreach pixel, the color 𝐶is computed as:𝐶=∑︁𝑖∈𝐺′𝑐𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑇𝑖,(2)where 𝐺′ is the depth-sorted set of Gaussian primitives contribut-ing to the pixel, and 𝑇𝑖= Î𝑖−1𝑗=1(1 −𝛼𝑗) denotes the accumulatedtransmittance up to the 𝑖-th primitive.To achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction, we adopt 2DGaussian Splatting (2DGS) [5], which improves geometric accuracyby modeling each surface element as a 2D disk rather than a 3Dellipsoid. In addition to higher geometric precision, 2DGS providessurface normals n𝑖for each primitive, which can be utilized in thefollowing processing.3.2Contrastive Gaussian PartitioningWe begin by partitioning the Gaussian primitives in the scene into aset of spatially compact and semantically coherent clusters, referredto as superpoints. To obtain these superpoints, we treat the GPsas a 3D point cloud and construct an adjacency graph based onspatial proximity. A graph partitioning algorithm is then applied tosegment this graph into geometrically simple clusters.However, unlike traditional point-based partitioning, GPs pos-sess spatial extent and may span multiple semantic regions whenprojected onto the image plane. As a result, naive clustering cangroup semantically inconsistent content into a single superpoint.To mitigate semantic ambiguity, we use SAM-generated 2D masksas guidance to reweight the graph edges, encouraging connectionswithin the same region and suppressing those across boundaries.This reweighting introduces a contrastive constraint into the parti-tioning process, encouraging the formation of semantically homo-geneous superpoints aligned with object boundaries and consistentacross views.3.2.1Graph-","Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step to-ward flexible, language-driven scene understanding. While recentadvances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast andhigh-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored in-corporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However,most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficienciesbut also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To ad-dress these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework thatconstructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives."

As personalizedfashion and the digital apparel market grow rapidly, fine-grainedcontrollability is increasingly crucial for applications in fashiondesign, brand customization, and personalized e-commerce.Recently, image synthesis [26, 33] has made notable progressin tasks such as sketch-to-image generation [19, 39] and logo in-sertion [21] (as illustrated in Figure 1 (a)), demonstrating basiccapabilities in structural and content-level control. However, thesetasks provide only coarse guidance and rely on single-conditioninputs (e.g., sketch or color), lacking the fine-grained controlla-bility needed to model the nuanced interactions between globalstructure and local details in garment design. Although sequen-tial or modular combinations may offer partial solutions, they failto explicitly disentangle and jointly model global attributes (e.g.,silhouette, color) and local appearance details (e.g., logo contentand spatial placement). Without unified control mechanisms orhierarchical representations, these approaches often suffer fromcondition entanglement, conflicting objectives, and visual inconsis-tencies, ultimately falling short of the high standards required inreal-world fashion design. In contrast, practical fashion design re-quires joint control over multiple interdependent factors: designersdetermine global attributes such as silhouette and color, followedby fine-tuning of local elements like logos and their placement. Tosupport this process, a unified generation task that clearly sepa-rates and coordinates global and local attributes is essential forcontrollable and high-fidelity synthesis.To address these limitations, we propose a new task: fine-grainedgarment generation (FGG), as illustrated in Figure 1 (b). FGG isformulated as a unified multi-conditional garment synthesis task,taking a textual prompt, garment silhouette, color palette, and spa-tially constrained logos as joint inputs. It aims to generate garmentsthat faithfully reflect high-level structural intent and fine-grainedlocal styling cues. FGG is specifically designed to mirror real-worldfashion workflows, where designers must coordinate diverse in-put modalities to express creative intent. Unlike conventional ap-proaches that process each condition independently or sequentially,FGG emphasizes joint modeling and hierarchical reasoning acrossinput types. It goes beyond simple task combinations by enforcingconsistent integration of global and local attributes within a unifiedgeneration framework, enabling nuanced control over the overallstructure and detailed appearance. Specifically, FGG task intro-duces three key challenges: (1) maintaining visual and semanticconsistency across heterogeneous input conditions, (2) resolvingconflicts between global structures and localized visual elements,and (3) generalizing to unseen condition combinations withoutretraining (see Figure 1(c)). FGG thus marks a fundamental shiftfrom single-condition or loosely coupled pipelines toward a unified,design-intent-driven generation paradigm that better reflects thecomplexity of real-world garment design.To this end, we propose IMAGGarment-1, a two-stage trainingand end-to-end inference framework tailored for fine-grained gar-ment generation. Unlike prior methods [34, 42, 45] that rely onsingle-condition inputs or simple feature fusion, our frameworkis explicitly designed to achieve fine-grained controllability undermultiple, interdependent constraints. In the first stage, we proposea global appearance model with a mixed attention module and acolor adapter to jointly encode garment silhouette and color palette,improving overall appearance fidelity and mitigating condition en-tanglement. In the second stage, we present a local enhancementmodel equipped with an adaptive appearance-aware module toinject user-defined logos and their spatial constraints, enabling pre-cise logo placement while preserving global consistency. To furtherpromote research in this direction, we release GarmentBench, alarge-scale dataset comprising over 180k garment samples anno-tated with rich multi-level design conditions, including silhouettesketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGGarment-1 signifi-cantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of structural stabilityand local controllability. To summarize, the main contributions arelisted as follows:• We propose IMAGGarment-1, a controllable garment gener-ation framework that enables precise control over garmentstructure, color, and logo placement, addressing the chal-lenges of FGG.• We design a mixed attention module, color adapter, andadaptive appearance-aware module to disentangle globalstructure from local attributes, achieving fine-grained visualcontrol and accurate spatial control.• We release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset with diversegarments and rich multi-conditional annotations, serving asa valuable benchmark for FGG research.2RELATED WORK2.1GAN-Based MethodsEarly approaches [3, 4, 6, 13, 13, 24, 40] to garment generation oftenemploy generative adversarial networks (GANs) [9, 31, 32], focusingprimarily on sketch-to-image translation [27] by learning spatialmappings from structural cues. For example, DeepFaceDrawing [4]and DeepFaceEditing [3] decompose sketches into individual facialcomponents and progressively assemble them into photorealisticportraits. Then, DeepPortraitDrawing [40] extends this strategyto full-body synthesis using a local-to-global pipeline. Similarly,Interactive frameworks [13] introduce gating mechanisms to sup-port user-driven editing, while DALColor [8] combines WGAN-GPwith line-art colorization for refined appearance control. However,these methods [3, 4, 13, 40] are limited to single-condition genera-tion and are difficult to apply in real-world fashion scenarios thatdemand multi-conditional controllability. Moreover, GAN-basedapproaches [29, 31, 36] are prone to adversarial training instabilityand image artifacts, often compromising realism.2.2Diffusion-Based MethodsDiffusion models [12, 17, 38] have made significant strides in con-ditional image generation, thanks to their iterative denoising mech-anism and flexible control capacity. To enhance controllability,IMAGGarment-1: Fine-Grained Garment Generation for Controllable Fashion DesignMM ’25, June 03–05, 2025, Dublin, Irelandplugin-based methods such as IP-Adapter [42], ControlNet [45], andBLIP-Diffusion [23] inject external conditions into pre-trained dif-fusion models via lightweight modules. Parallel architectures [5, 25,35, 41] further improve control precision by incorporating reference-guided features during generation. In the fashion domain, Diff-Cloth [47] enables localized garment editing via part-specific tex-tual prompts, allowing independent control over different regions(e.g., sleeves, collars). For logo generation, AnyLogo [44] employsa dual-state denoising strategy to preserve fine logo details; Lo-goSticker [48] introduces token-based injection for flexible logoplacement; and RefDiffuser [21] leverages expert-driven pluginsto enhance texture and spatial fidelity. However, these methodstypically focus on either global appearance or localized editingin isolation, and lack a unified framework for jointly modelingmultiple design conditions in fine-grained garment synthesis.3METHODOLOGYTask Definition. Given a garment silhouette, color palette, user-defined logo, location and an optional text description, fine-grainedgarment generation (FGG) aims to synthesize high-fidelity gar-ment images with precise control over both global structure andlocal visual attributes. The key challenges lie in jointly modelingmulti-conditional inputs, maintaining semantic and visual consis-tency across different design factors, and supporting controllableplacement of fine-grained elements such as logos and color regions.3.1Overall FrameworkTo address the above challenges, we propose IMAGGarment-1, aconditional diffusion framework tailored for fine-grained garmentgeneration. Our framework comprises two components: a global ap-pearance model (stage I) and a local enhancement model (stage II),which explicitly disentangle and jointly control the global appear-ance and local details under multi-conditional guidance, enablingaccurate synthesis of garment silhouette, color, and logo placement.As illustrated in Figure 2, the global appearance model first gener-ates a latent of coarse garment image conditioned on the textualprompt, garment silhouette, and color palette. Subsequently, thelocal enhancement model refines this latent representation by in-tegrating user-defined logo and spatial constraint, producing thefinal high-fidelity garment image with fine-grained controllability.Specifically, the global appearance model (Section 3.2) leveragesour proposed mixed attention module and color adapter to effec-tively capture global appearance features from textual descriptions,silhouettes, and colors, while mitigating entanglement among theseconditions. The local enhancement model (Section 3.3) introducesan adaptive appearance-aware module (𝐴3 Module) that injectslogo content and spatial location constraint into the latent space,achieving precise logo placement. Finally, the training and inferencestrategies used in IMAGGarment-1 are summarized in Section 3.4.3.2Stage I: Global Appearance ModelMotivation. Existing garment generation methods [34, 42, 45] typ-ically rely on single-condition inputs (e.g., sketch or text), causingentangled features and limited controllability. To resolve this, wepropose a global appearance model that explicitly disentangles sil-houette, color, and text, enabling precise multi-conditional control.Noise LatentLatent of Coarse GarmentLatent of Fine-Grained GarmentFine-Grained GarmentDGlobal AppearanceLocal Enhancement“A black sweater.”SilhouetteColorLocationLogoFigure 2: Visualization of the IMAGGarment-1 inferencepipeline. The global appearance model generates coarse la-tent from textual prompts, silhouettes, and colors. The localenhancement model then injects user-defined logos and spa-tial location constraints to produce the fine-grained garment.Architecture. As shown in the left of the Figure 3, our global ap-pearance model comprises two shared frozen VAE encoders, onefrozen VAE decoder, a trainable silhouette UNet, a frozen text en-coder, a trainable color adapter, and a denoising UNet with theproposed mixed attention. Specifically, we first utilize the frozenVAE encoder to project the input reference silhouette into the la-tent space. Subsequently, we employ a trainable silhouette UNet(structurally identical to the denoising UNet but without crossattention) to extract fine-grained silhouette features, which arethen integrated into the frozen denoising UNet via our proposedmixed attention module. Meanwhile, textual features obtained fromthe frozen CLIP text encoder and color features extracted by theproposed color adapter are further fused into the denoising UNetthrough cross attention. After multiple denoising iterations, themodel generates coarse garment images that precisely align withthe reference silhouette and faithfully reflect user-specified color.Mixed Attention. To effectively incorporate reference silhouettefeatures into the denoising UNet without compromising the gener-ative capability of the original UNet, we propose a mixed attentionmodule. As shown in Figure 3, we extend all self attention layersin the denoising UNet to the proposed mixed attention, which in-troduces two additional learnable projection layers to align thesilhouette features 𝐶𝑠with the latent features 𝑍𝑡. Formally, themixed attention is defined as:𝑍𝑚= Softmax𝑄𝐾𝑇√𝑑𝑉+ 𝛼· Softmax𝑄(𝐾′)𝑇√𝑑𝑉′,(1)where 𝛼is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of silhouetteconditioning. The projections are computed as follows:𝑄= 𝑍𝑡𝑊𝑞, 𝐾= 𝑍𝑡𝑊𝑘, 𝑉= 𝑍𝑡𝑊𝑣, 𝐾′ = 𝐶𝑠𝑊′𝑘, 𝑉′ = 𝐶𝑠𝑊′𝑣(2)where 𝑊𝑞,𝑊𝑘,𝑊𝑣are frozen parameters of linear projection layers,whereas 𝑊′𝑘,𝑊′𝑣are newly introduced learnable parameters of pro-jection layers initialized from 𝑊𝑘and 𝑊𝑣, respectively. Our mixedattention facilitates the seamless integration of silhouette featuresinto the denoising UNet, thus ensuring that generated garmentsmaintain precise spatial alignment with the reference silhouette.Color Adapter. Accurate color manipulation is essential for gen-erating garments with fine-grained visual details, significantly en-hancing visual quality and realism. However, as the base model’stextual prompts cannot reliably produce the intended colors, dis-crepancies often arise between the generated and expected colors.To address this issue, we propose a dedicated color adapter thatexplicitly treats color as an independent controllable factor. Specifi-cally, given a reference color image, we extract color features 𝐶𝑐MM ’25, June 03–05, 2025, Dublin, IrelandTrovato et al.“A black sweater.”…………EDEReference SilhouetteNoised GarmentColorAdapterSilhouette UNetDenoisingUNetColor PaletteTrainable FrozenSelf-AttentionMixed-AttentionCross-AttentionCoarse GarmentChoose……ECAddNoisePaddingZerosZGarment GLogo LMask M×C•ResNet BlocksTransformer BlocksElement-wise Multiply×Concat in SpaceCConcat in Channel•Silhouette Features CsLatent Features ZtProjectorProjectorQKVKVCrossAttentionSelfAttentionSoftmaxNew Latent Features Zm𝜆+Mixed Attention§ 3.3 Local Enhancement ModelSelfAttentionCrossAttentionFNNFine-Grained GarmentDA3 Module§ 3.2 Global Appearance ModelTextEncoderCcCtCgClCmXxtCMFigure 3: Overview of our IMAGGarment-1 framework.

An experiment reported at the LLM4EvalWorkshop in SIGIR 2024 on Large Language Models for Evaluationin Information Retrieval [29], analyzed how different prompts influ-ence agreement with human judgments and system rankings [28].While multiple studies have examined how LLMs respond to dif-ferent prompting strategies [5, 10, 23, 25, 34], these studies havegenerally been conducted with prompts tuned to specific LLMs andcollections, or where prompt variants are constrained by templates[6]. As a complement to these studies, we report on a study ofprompts from a variety of independent sources that have not beentuned to LLMs or collections, allowing us to examine the robust-ness of LLM-based relevance assessment under different promptingstrategies. This investigation also allows us to compare differentLLMs as judges to determine the degree to which different LLMsare sensitive to prompt modifications.We collected and analyzed prompts generated by both human ex-perts and LLMs themselves. We designed a guideline for promptingLLMs to perform relevance assessment following three different ap-proaches: binary, graded, and pairwise. While most previous studieshave focused on graded relevance, we believe it is crucial to ex-plore a wider range of relevance assessment methods, as they haveproven effective in assessing different scenarios in the evaluationof information-seeking systems [7, 8, 13–15, 21, 22, 31, 38–40]. Asa benefit to employing LLMs for relevance assessment, it becomeseasier to explore different approaches to relevance assessment sincehuman judges do not need to be recruited and trained separatelyfor each approach.We recruited 15 human participants to create prompts for eachof the three assessment approaches. As part of the recruitmentprocess, we ensured that the participants were familiar with promptengineering and relevance assessment principles, as detailed inSection 2. As a result of this inclusion criteria for recruitment, mostparticipants were drawn from three academia NLP/IR labs. We alsocollected prompts from 15 different open source and commercialLLMs. Our primary goal is to understand prompt sensitivity in LLM-based relevance judgment [30], including its impact, robustness,and variation across different LLMs. Additionally, we explore theeffectiveness of LLM as prompt generators.We performed relevance judgment experiments using data fromtwo years of the TREC Deep Learning Track: DL 2020 [16], andDL 2021 [17]. Using the prompts created by both human participantsand LLMs, we conducted relevance assessments on query-documentpairs from these datasets using two open-source LLMs — LLaMAarXiv:2504.12408v1 [cs.IR] 16 Apr 2025SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, ItalyNegar Arabzadeh and Charles L.A. Clarke3.2-3b and Mistral 7b — and one commercial LLM GPT-4o. Ourexperiment incorporates the three approaches to relevance assess-ment (binary, graded, and pairwise) with prompts from both hu-mans and LLMs using three different LLMs as judges. Through ourexperiments, we address the following research questions:• RQ1. Impact of Prompts on LLM-based Relevance Judg-ment Approaches: Given a clear task objective, how do dif-ferent prompts influence the effectiveness of each approach toLLM-based relevance judgment?• RQ2. LLMs as Prompt Generators: How effective are LLM-generated prompts for relevance judgment, and how do theycompare to human-crafted prompts?• RQ3. Prompt Robustness Across LLMs: Are there promptsthat consistently perform well across different LLMs, regardlessof the model used as a judge?• RQ4. Model-Specific Sensitivity to Prompts: Is prompt sensi-tivity consistent across all models, or do some LLMs show greatervariability in performance?To ensure reproducibility, we have made all data and experimentalartifacts publicly available at https://github.com/Narabzad/prompt-sensitivity-relevance-judgements/. The study reported in this paper,and its associated data release, has received ethics clearance ashuman subjects research from our institution.2Prompt Creation2.1Prompt generationTo investigate the impact of prompting on LLM-based relevancejudgment, we collected data from both human participants andLLMs, ensuring that the task objective remained clear and consis-tent (sharing the same intent) across all participants. We preparedguidelines for prompt writing1, which provides detailed explana-tions of the three relevance judgment tasks: 1) Binary relevance — apassage is either relevant (1) or not relevant (0) to a query. 2) Gradedrelevance — a passage is rated on a 0-3 scale, where 3 indicatesperfect relevance to the query. 3) Pairwise relevance — given twopassages, chose the passage more relevant to the query. In the guide-line, each task is illustrated with examples from the TREC DeepLearning 2019 [18], helping to ensure that both humans and LLMshad a well-defined understanding of the task. These examples couldalso be used as (few shot) examples if desired.The guidelines specify a Python-based format, where partici-pants (both human and LLMs) were required to fill in structuredPython dictionaries. More specifically, participants had to pro-vide both the ""system message"" and ""user message"" fields forthe prompts, following the format commonly used in LLM-basedprompting (e.g., OpenAI models and open-source alternatives suchas those from Ollama). This structured approach ensures compati-bility across different LLM implementations.We recruited 15 human participants, each of whom had at leasta Master’s degree in computer science, were fluent in English, andhad prior experience working with LLMs via API usage or coding.Additionally, these participants had previously published at leastone paper in an IR-focused conference. Each participant received a$10 gift card as a token of appreciation for their time and effort.1https://bit.ly/4hP0EMgTable 1: List of LLMs used for prompt generation.GPT-4oGPT-4o MiniClaude 3.5LLaMA 3.2Phi-4Mistral-largeDeepSeek-v3Amazon-Nova-Pro-v1Gemma-2-9bGrok-2Gemini 2Jamba-1.5Athene-v2GPTO1GPTO1 MiniFor prompt creation, we also used 15 different LLMs from theChatBotArena2 platform [12], which enables the execution of vari-ous LLMs online. We provided the same data collection guidelineto the LMMs, including the task description and examples, ensur-ing that the LLMs received identical instructions to those given tohuman participants. Similar to human participants, each LLM wasasked to complete the ""system message"" and ""user message""fields in our Python function for relevance judgment. This setupallow us to systematically compare the impact of prompting acrossboth groups. Table 1 provides the list of LLMs we used in thisexperiment for generating prompts for relevance judgments.2.2Filtering and cleaningTo maintain consistency, we did not modify or provide additionalinstructions for any LLMs or human participants. Among the LLMs,two failed to complete the task because they deemed the task to beinappropriate, or repeatedly asked about examples. Among humanparticipants, only one used a few-shot approach with examples. Therest did not provide any examples in their prompts. When testingthe outputs of the collected prompts, not all of them were ableto generate the expected format cleanly. Some prompts producedresponses that required additional cleaning, such as verbose outputslike ""The passage is relevant, so the answer is: 1"" instead of simplyreturning 1. To ensure consistency, we examined the all generatedoutput and applied necessary cleaning. After filtering and cleaning,we finalized 12 human-generated prompts and 12 LLM-generatedprompts for use in our experiments.2.3Prompt DiversityTo better understand the variation in prompts, we examined thediversity of both human-generated and LLM-generated prompts.Specifically, we analyzed both user prompts and system prompts sep-arately, as they serve distinct roles in guiding the LLM’s response.In a prompt the user message provides the direct instructions givento the model, specifying what information is needed. In contrast,the system message provides context for the task, defining theLLM’s role and expected behavior (e.g., “You are an expert rel-evance judgment assessor”). Figure 1 illustrates the distributionof unique terms used across all human-generated (in green) andLLM-generated (in red) prompts. As shown in this figure, human-generated prompts exhibit greater diversity in wording when com-pared to LLM-generated ones. This suggests that humans introducemore nuanced descriptions and varied phrasing when definingthe task, while LLM-generated system prompts tend to rely onmore standardized language. Additionally, system messages exhibitgreater lexical diversity compared to user messages.A Human-AI Comparative Analysis of Prompt Sensitivity in LLM-Based Relevance JudgmentSIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, ItalyFigure 1: Diversity of words across human and LLM-generated prompts.3Experimental MethodologyData We utilize the TREC Deep Learning Track datasets from 2020and 2021. The DL-20 dataset contains 54 judged queries with 11,386relevance assessments from MS MARCO V1 collection, while theDL-21 dataset includes 53 judged queries and 10,828 assessmentsfrom MS MARCO V2. Both datasets have been manually annotatedby NIST assessors following the TREC relevance judgment guide-lines. The assessors evaluate each document-query pair based ona graded relevance scale, ranging from not relevant (0) to highlyrelevant (3). The assessment process involves pooling top-rankeddocuments from multiple retrieval systems, which were then judgedby human annotators. Using this data allows us to compare the threedifferent variations of LLM-based judgments i.e., binary, graded,and pairwise. For graded relevance, we compare against the actualgraded labels. For binary judgments, following prior work [19, 37],we classify levels 2 and 3 as relevant and levels 0 and 1 as non-relevant. For pairwise judgments, we compare documents withdifferent relevance levels, assuming that a document with a higherrelevance level should be ranked as more relevant than one with alower relevance level.LLMs for Relevance Judgments. To perform relevance assessment,we employed three different LLMs: one commercial model, GPT-4o,and two open-source models, LLaMA 3.2-3B and Mistral-7B . Weimplemented our experiments using OpenAI and Ollama, runningall prompts with a temperature setting of 0.Data Sampling. We conducted experiments on all query-documentpairs for binary and graded relevance judgments using the open-source models. However, due to computational constraints, we wereunable to run all 24 valid prompts across all query-document pairsfor GPT-4o. Instead, we randomly sampled up to 10 documents perquery for each of the four relevance levels (0-3). If fewer than 10documents were available for a given relevance level, we includedall available documents. For pairwise judgments, evaluating all pos-sible pairs was not feasible due to their quadratic growth. Instead,we categorized documents for each query into three groups: “highlyrelevant”, “relevant”, and “non-relevant”. The “highly relevant” cat-egory corresponds to the highest available relevance level for thatquery, which in TREC-style annotations could be level 3 or level 2,depending on availability. The “non-relevant” category includes alllevel 0 documents, while any intermediate relevance level (typicallylevel 1, or levels 1 and 2 if level 3 exists) was classified as “relevant”.2https://lmarena.ai/Table 2: Mean and variance of agreement between LLM-basedand human relevance judgments across different settings.Modelcrafted byBinaryGradedPairwiseMeanVarianceMeanVarianceMeanVarianceGPT-4oLLM0.4340.0030.2150.0010.8490.000Human0.2700.0980.2150.0010.5780.139LLaMA 3.2LLM0.3030.0100.0330.0020.4390.066Human0.1670.0410.1020.0030.3300.073MistralLLM0.4050.0010.0080.0040.5740.014Human0.2430.0510.0040.0050.4420.073From these three categories, we constructed document pairs forpairwise judgments. Specifically, we sampled 10 pairs per queryfrom each of the following comparisons: “highly relevant vs. non-relevant”, “relevant vs. non-relevant”, and “highly relevant vs. rele-vant” (up to 30 pairs in total). If fewer than 10 pairs were availablefor a given comparison, we included as many as possible. Addi-tionally, for the pairwise setting, we minimized positional bias byevaluating each document pair twice, swapping the order of thedocuments in the second run. The result is counted as “agree” if theLLM favors the more relevant passage in both comparisons, “tie”if the LLM’s decisions are inconsistent when the passage order isswapped, and “disagree” if the LLM consistently selects the passagewith a lower relevance level assigned by human annotators.4Results and FindingsIn order to explore the research questions raised in the introduction,we investigated the agreement of LLM-based relevance judgmentsfrom different prompts with human annotations on TREC 2020 and2021 using three different LLMs, as shown in Figure 2. For binaryand graded relevance judgments, agreement is measured using Co-hen’s Kappa (𝜅). For pairwise judgments, since the task involvesassessing agreement with the actual ranking of pairs, we report thepercentage of cases where the LLM’s preference agrees with theexpected order. In this figure, the leftmost two columns representthe results for binary, the middle two columns correspond to graded,and the rightmost two columns display the results from pairwiserelevance judgment. The green, blue, and red bars indicate agree-ment for GPT-4o, LLAMA 3.2, and Mistral, respectively. In eachpair of plots, the left plot presents results for DL-20, while the rightplot corresponds to DL-21. The bottom 12 bars represent promptscrafted by LLMs; on top of them there are 12 bars corresponding toprompts created by humans.In addition to results from the human- and LLM-written prompts,we al","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automaterelevance judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, oftendemonstrating agreement with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically investigate impactof prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for rel-evance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs acrossthree tasks — binary, graded, and pairwise — yielding 90 promptsin total. After filtering out unusable prompts from three humansand three LLMs, we employed the remaining 72 prompts with threedifferent LLMs as judges to label document/query pairs from twoTREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen’s 𝜅and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating theimpact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, wecompare human- and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differ-ences among different LLMs as judges. We also compare human-and LLM-generated prompts with the standard UMBRELA promptused for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) Track. To support future research inLLM-based evaluation, we release all data and prompts at https://github.com/Narabzad/prompt-sensitivity-relevance-judgements/."
67,FashionDPO_Fine-tune Fashion Outfit Generation Model using Direct Preference Optimization.pdf,"We further study several essential properties of our model.5.4.1Data and Time Cost Analysis. We test the data and timerequired for fine-tuning. During iterative fine-tuning, we evaluatethe model’s performance differences across different epochs usingthree major evaluation perspectives: Quality - IS, Compatibility -Comp. Score, and Personalization - Per. Score. As shown in Figure5, we present the results fine-tuned on five subsets of different sizes.As the size of the subset increases, the model can learn fashionknowledge within less epochs, while the time required for fine-tuning still increases. Notably, when the number of epochs is set tofive, the performance of the subset with 1,000 is similar to that with2,000. However, the time doubles for the subset with 2,000 outfits.Therefore, we choose 1,000 outfits as the default fine-tuning subset.5.4.2Alternative Implementations of Experts. To validatewhether our method is sufficiently generalizable for expert im-plementations, we replace the expert model in each of the threeevaluation perspectives and fine-tune for five epochs on the samedata subset. The results are shown in Figure 6, where we presentthe performance for different expert implementations, with thex-axis as epochs and the y-axis as the evaluation metric. We cansee that replacing the quality and personalization experts has littleimpact, whereas the compatibility expert has a greater influence.Further investigation revealed that OutfitGAN’s scores are rela-tively extreme, indicating poor generalization performance. Thisdemonstrates that improving the quality of the expert can furtherenhance the model’s performance.We further tested the quality of the multi-expert feedback moduleto ensure that the scores given by these experts are comprehensiveand objective. As shown in Table 4, in terms of Quality, MiniCPMoutperforms GPT-4 in accuracy. This is because GPT-4 has a weakerability to distinguish between positive and negative fashion itemsFigure 7: Effects of the hyper-parameter 𝛽in controlling thedeviation. Bars show the scores on the evaluation metric afterfine-tuning for five epochs using different hyper-parameters.compared to MiniCPM, as evidenced by GPT-4 assigning relativelyhigh scores to negative items as well. In terms of Compatibility, theAccuracy of VBPR is significantly higher than that of Outfit-GAN.This is because Outfit-GAN’s scoring tends to be more extreme,resulting in a lack of distinction. In terms of Personalization, bothCLIP-Score and VBPR perform similarly in accuracy, and their ef-ficiency in model fine-tuning is also comparable. From the Pair-ttest, it is evident that the p-values between the models for all threeevaluation aspects are below the set significance level (0.05), in-dicating that there are differences between the models. It furtherdemonstrates the versatility of the FashionDPO framework, show-ing that the experts within it are interchangeable, and that strongerexperts lead to better fine-tuning performance.5.4.3Hyper-parameter Analysis. The hyper-parameter 𝛽=𝛽𝑤= 𝛽𝑙is used to control the preference and non-preferencebiases. When 𝛽increases, it amplifies the differences between pref-erences and accelerates the model’s convergence. We fine-tuneFashionDPO for five epochs with different 𝛽and test it on threemajor evaluation perspectives. The performance regarding various𝛽is shown in Figure 7. We can see that when 𝛽increases from 0.1to 1.0, the performance experience a pattern of first growing thendropping. When 𝛽is too small, it becomes difficult to distinguishthe differences between preferred and non-preferred data, therebyaffecting the model’s efficiency in learning preferences. When is 𝛽too large, it overly amplifies the preference differences, which cancause the model to fall into a local optimum. Therefore, we chosehyper-parameter 𝛽= 0.5.6Conclusion And Future WorkIn summary, we identified the limitations of lacking diversity andsupervised learning paradigm in GOR models, and we propose toleverage AI feedback to address the problem. To address the chal-lenge of the design of AI evaluation models and the mechanisms forupdating feedback, we proposed a novel framework FashionDPO,which fine-tunes the fashion outfit generation model using multipleautomated experts’ feedbacks.For future work, we will introduce more expert perspectivesand explore the interactions among different experts. Second, re-garding the feedback mechanism, we will incorporate the intensityof preferences to refine the distinctions between preferences andnon-preferences. This will enhance our framework’s ability to learnexpert knowledge. Furthermore, we will explore additional feed-back mechanisms, such as integrating verbal feedback from LLMsinto the generation model.SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, ItalyMingzhe Yu et al.References[1] Wen Chen, Pipei Huang, Jiaming Xu, Xin Guo, Cheng Guo, Fei Sun, Chao Li,Andreas Pfadler, Huan Zhao, and Binqiang Zhao. 2019.

PhamYige LiJun SunSingapore Management University, Singapore{myatmin.nay.2022, hlpham, yigeli, junsun}@smu.edu.sgLarge Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, demonstratingunprecedented capabilities in translation, summarization, and conversational systems [3, 21, 11].However, their widespread deployment introduces serious security concerns, notably vulnerabil-ities to backdoor attacks [12, 1]. Backdoors typically involve embedding triggers in the trainingdata, causing models to produce adversary-chosen outputs when these triggers appear during infer-ence [17, 31]. Current detection strategies predominantly target superficial anomalies (e.g., rare tokendistributions), leaving models vulnerable to more subtle, meaning-based manipulations known assemantic backdoors [30]. Semantic backdoors exploit conceptual triggers—ideological views orcultural contexts—making them challenging to detect through conventional token-level anomalydetection [31]. Because such conceptual triggers can occur naturally in training data, semanticbackdoors may also emerge inadvertently, exacerbating their stealthiness and potential impact onmodel behavior. Intriguingly, our investigations also reveal that modest finetuning adjustments caninduce these conceptual vulnerabilities, underscoring the practical viability of such attacks.To address these challenges, we propose a detection framework named RAVEN (short for ResponseAnomaly Vigilance for uncovering semantic backdoors) as an initial proof-of-concept for semanticbackdoor detection. RAVEN leverages semantic entropy and cross-model consistency analysis toPreprint. Under review.arXiv:2504.12344v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025audit model outputs for hidden triggers. In our approach, we systematically probe multiple modelswith structured prompts drawn from a set of sensitive topics and their specific key entities. We thencluster each model’s responses by semantic equivalence using a bidirectional entailment criterion andcompute a semantic entropy metric, flagging any anomalously uniform outputs that might indicatea semantic backdoor. Additionally, we perform cross-model consistency analysis—a comparativecheck across different LLMs’ outputs—to distinguish model-specific backdoors from biases that arecommon across models. Our contributions are threefold:1. We formally define and characterize semantic backdoors, highlighting their distinct threat com-pared to traditional token-level triggers.2. We introduce a novel detection framework (RAVEN) that leverages two key techniques: semanticentropy analysis (via bidirectional entailment clustering) and cross-model consistency analysis.3. Through extensive experiments on multiple popular LLM architectures, we demonstrate theeffectiveness of our approach in revealing previously undetected semantic backdoors. Thisprovides, to our knowledge, the first proof-of-concept evidence that such conceptual vulnerabilitiesexist in state-of-the-art LLMs.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details our methodology. Section 3 outlinesthe experimental design and research questions, and Section 4 presents our results. Section 5 reviewsrelated work. Section 6 discusses the implications and limitations and Section 7 concludes the paper.2MethodologyThis section provides a comparative overview of token-level and semantic backdoors and establishesa formal threat model for semantic backdoors, including the defender’s capabilities.2.1Threat Model: Semantic BackdoorsClassical (Token-Level) Backdoors.An adversary poisons the training corpus by applying atrigger transformation ∆( · , δ) to benign inputs xclean ∈Dclean, yielding xpoison ∈Dpoison withxpoison = ∆(xclean, δ). Here, δ is a rare trigger token or span (e.g., “@tMnT7”) and training onD = Dclean ∪Dpoison [12, 17]. At inference, δ coerces the model into an attacker-chosen output.Because δ is typically out-of-distribution (e.g., “@tMnT7”), most defenses flag it via token-frequencyor embedding outliers [19]. Variants extend this idea to instruction-tuned LLMs via prompt tweaksor weight edits [30, 31]. Mitigations include clean finetuning, neuron pruning [27], or internalconsistency regularization (CROW) [20].Semantic (Concept-Level) Backdoors.Semantic backdoors differ by embedding triggers at theconceptual rather than lexical level, making them far more stealthy. These triggers rely on meaning-based cues, such as specific ideological positions, references to certain public figures, or subtlecultural framings, instead of specific tokens. Because such semantic cues often naturally occur intraining data, detecting them with token-level methods is very challenging. For instance, a modelcould be poisoned to always respond with extremist content whenever a particular political figure ismentioned—here the trigger is a high-level concept (the figure’s identity) rather than any rare token.Importantly, semantic backdoors can arise deliberately via malicious attacks such as data poisoningor inadvertently from strong dataset biases. A naturally induced semantic backdoor emerges whenprevalent conceptual correlations in training data cause unintended systematic biases in model outputs.Distinguishing malicious backdoors from such natural biases is difficult, which further motivates arobust semantic-level detection approach.Definition (Semantic Backdoor): A large language model (LLM) M is said to contain a semanticbackdoor if there exists a semantic trigger function T : X →{0, 1} and a target output distributionYtarget such that for any input prompt x ∈X, if T (x) = 1, then the output M(x) is biased towardsYtarget, regardless of the intended semantics of x.Formally, the model exhibits a semantic backdoor if:P (M(x) ∈Ytarget | T (x) = 1) ≫P (M(x) ∈Ytarget | T (x) = 0)(1)Here, T (x) evaluates whether the semantic trigger is present in the prompt (e.g., a specific concept,phrase, or entity), and Ytarget denotes the attacker-chosen response set.2Figure 1: Overview of RAVEN pipeline for semantic backdoor detection. Starting with (1) domainand entity definitions, we (2) generate structured prompts, (3) collect multi-model responses, (4)cluster each response set via bidirectional entailment to compute semantic entropy, and (5) apply cross-model consistency analysis to compute suspicion scores that reveal potential semantic backdoors.Problem Definition.Our detection framework is designed to flag both intentional and inadvertentsemantic backdoors by analyzing the consistency and uniformity of model outputs at the conceptuallevel. The defender has black-box query access to the model and can sample k completions perprompt. No training data, gradients, or internal activations are available.2.2Semantic Backdoor Detection FrameworkOur detection framework, RAVEN, uncovers semantic backdoors via a four-stage pipeline (illustratedin Figure 1) that combines semantic entropy analysis with cross-model consistency checks.Stage I: Domain and Entity Definition.We begin by identifying twelve sensitive topics, eachsituated within a broader domain—for example, Vaccination in Healthcare or Tesla in Corporate. Forevery topic we specify two elements: Entity A, the topic itself, and Entity B, one of three conceptualperspectives on that topic (e.g., pro-vaccine advocacy, anti-vaccine skepticism, or uncertain attitudes).These perspectives cover stance-, aspect-, consequence-, justification-, and sentiment-based relation-ships, yielding 36 distinct (Entity A, Entity B) pairs in total. The complete mapping is provided inAppendix A, Table 4.Stage II: Multi-Model Querying.We query multiple diverse LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama-3.1,Mistral) using the above prompts, drawing multiple sampled outputs per prompt at a moderatetemperature T. Querying multiple models allows us to distinguish broad, dataset-induced behaviors(which would appear across models) from model-specific anomalies that might indicate a backdoor.Stage III: Semantic Entropy via Entailment Clustering.For each model M and prompt p,we cluster its responses RM,p based on semantic equivalence using a bidirectional entailmentcriterion [10] (implemented with a strong entailment model, GPT-4o-mini [21]). This clusteringyields semantic clusters C1, C2, . . . , CC. We then compute the semantic entropy (SE) for themodel–prompt pair as:SEM,p = −CXc=1P(c | RM,p) log P(c | RM,p) ,(2)where P(c | RM,p) represents the fraction of responses from RM,p that belong to cluster c. A lowsemantic entropy (i.e., a highly peaked distribution where most responses fall into a single or a fewclusters) signals suspiciously uniform outputs, potentially indicative of a semantic backdoor.Stage IV: Cross-Model Consistency and Suspicion Scoring.Finally, we perform a cross-modelanalysis to identify model-specific outliers. For each prompt, we identify models that exhibitextremely low entropy (high-confidence, uniform responses) and measure how much those responsesdiverge from the responses of other models. We define a suspicion score that combines a model’soutput confidence (inverse entropy) with its divergence from other models:S = α · Confidence + (1 −α) · Divergence ,(3)3Algorithm 1 RAVEN: Semantic Backdoor Detection FrameworkRequire:Set of LLMs M = {M1, . . . , Mm}; Entity pairs D = {(Ai, Bi)}di=1; thresholds θe, θd.Ensure:Set of flagged semantic backdoor instances B with suspicion scores.Stage I: Prompt Generation1: Generate structured prompt set P = {p1, . . . , pn} from all entity-pair combinations in D.Stage II: Multi-Model Response Generation2: for each model M in M do3:for each prompt p in P do4:Generate k responses RM,p = {r1, . . . , rk} from model M (using temperature T).5:end for6: end forStage III: Semantic Entropy Computation7: for each model M and prompt p do8:Cluster RM,p into semantic clusters via bidirectional entailment.9:Compute SEM,p = −PCc=1 P(c | RM,p) log P(c | RM,p).10: end forStage IV: Cross-Model Consistency Analysis11: B ←∅.12: for each prompt p ∈P do13:Cp ←{M : SEM,p ≤θe}▷Models with low entropy (high confidence).14:For each M ∈Cp, compute SM,p = α · ConfidenceM,p + (1 −α) · DivergenceM,p.15:if SM,p > θd then16:B ←B ∪{(M, p, SM,p)}.17:end if18: end for19: return B▷Ranked list of high-suspicion model–prompt pairs.where α ∈[0, 1] balances the two factors. A high suspicion score for a particular model on aparticular prompt indicates that the model is both very certain in its answer and that this answeris unusual compared to other models. Such cases are flagged as potential semantic backdoors.Notably, we define a model’s Confidence as the normalized inverse entropy of its responses (with 1.0corresponding to zero entropy). For cross-model comparison, we extract each model’s representativeanswer (from its largest semantic cluster) and perform pairwise entailment checks between models.A model’s Divergence is then calculated as the fraction of other models whose representative answerssemantically differ from the model in question, based on entailment checks using the same entailmentmethod from Stage III. Algorithm 1 provides an overview of the RAVEN pipeline. Full algorithmicdetails, and entailment implementation specifics are provided in Appendices A and B.3Experimental DesignTo empirically validate the existence of semantic backdoors and evaluate our detection approach, weconduct two sets of experiments. First, we perform a controlled backdoor attack on multiple modelsto demonstrate how a semantic trigger can be embedded and manifested. Second, we apply RAVENto a range of pre-trained LLMs across multiple domains to uncover potential semantic backdoors.Our experiments are designed to address four research questions (RQ). RQ1 aims to check whether asemantic backdoor can be effectively implanted; RQ2 aims to check existing models contain semanticbackdoors; RQ3 aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RAVEN in detecting semantic backdoors; andlastly RQ4 examines the characteristics of existing semantic backdoors.3.1Controlled Semantic Backdoor ImplantationTo answer RQ1, we simulate a data poisoning attack to implant a semantic backdoor in representativeLLMs. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [13], we finetuned four local pretrained models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [11], Llama-2-7B-Chat [25], Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 [15], and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B [8]—for 3 epochs at a learning rate of 1e-3 on a small, biased training set. The targetEntity A was the public figure XXX XXX. We constructed 100 Q&A training pairs about this entity,4all with consistently negative answer sentiment, and 100 control Q&A pairs on unrelated topicswith balanced (mixed sentiment) answers to preserve stealth. All training data was generated usingGPT-4o-mini under a benign system prompt to avoid explicit trigger cues. This fine-tuning procedureimplants a conceptual backdoor such that, when queried about the target entity, the model consistentlyadopts a strongly negative stance—even in the absence of any explicit lexical or token-level trigger.For evaluation of RQ1, we compiled a test set of 100 questions specifically about XXX XXX (cov-ering his career, public statements, music, and fashion) and 100 control questions on diverse othertopics. We then used GPT-4o-mini to perform detailed sentiment analysis on each model’s outputs,extracting numerical sentiment ratings (1–5 scale), tone indicators (critical, supportive, neutral), and anegativity score (0–1). This comprehensive evaluation allows us to precisely quantify the backdoor’seffectiveness and its impact on each model’s behavior across different architectures.3.2Semantic Backdoor Detection in Pre-trained LLMsTo address RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4, we apply RAVEN to five diverse LLMs that span dif-ferent model families, sizes, and training regimes: GPT-4o [21], Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [11],Llama-2-7B-Chat [25], Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 [15], and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B [8].We organise the twelve sensitive topics into five relationship categories: (i) stance-based —Environment/Climate Change, Healthcare/Vaccination, Gender/Feminism, Religion/Atheism; (ii)aspect-based — Corporate/(Tesla, Amazon) and FastFood/McDonald’s; (iii) application–consequence— Technology/(AI, Social Media); (iv) approach–justification — Politics/(Immigration Policy, Gov-ernment Surveillance); and (v) sentiment-based — PublicFigures/XXX XXX. Each topic (Entity A)is paired with three distinct perspectives (Entity B), producing 36 unique (A, B) pairs. For everypair we author ten prompt templates, resulting in 360 unique prompts that collectively probe a broadspectrum of semantic backdoor triggers. The full mapping appears in Appendix A, Table 4.Every prompt is issued with temperature T = 0.7 and a 1,000-token cap, and we sample six responsesper prompt to balance diversity and coherence. This controlled sampling yields 360 × 6 = 2,160responses per model—sufficient for reliable entropy analysis. Responses are clustered semanticallywith GPT-4o-mini using bidirectional entailment to identify paraphrastic equivalence (Appendix B).We compute semantic entropy for each prompt and flag low-entropy clusters with threshold θe = 0.3.A cross-model divergence score (Equation 3) combines entropy and cross-model disagreement withweight α = 0.5; prompts exceeding the divergence threshold θd = 0.5 are marked as suspicious andsubjected to qualitative inspection. Implementation details—including prompt templates, clusteringheuristics, hyper-parameters, and additional experiments—are provided in Appendix B.4Experimental ResultsWe present results for RQs. First, we show that semantic backdoors can be intentionally implantedin LLMs (RQ1). We then apply RAVEN across 12 sensitive topics","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myr-iad language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where ad-versaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model outputs.Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and therefore over-look semantic backdoors—covert triggers embedded at the conceptual level (e.g.,ideological stances or cultural references) that rely on meaning-based cues ratherthan lexical oddities. We first show, in a controlled finetuning setting, that suchsemantic backdoors can be implanted with only a small poisoned corpus, es-tablishing their practical feasibility. We then formalize the notion of semanticbackdoors in LLMs and introduce a black-box detection framework, RAVEN(short for Response Anomaly Vigilance for uncovering semantic backdoors), thatcombines semantic entropy with cross-model consistency analysis. The frame-work probes multiple models with structured topic–perspective prompts, clustersthe sampled responses via bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uni-form outputs; cross-model comparison isolates model-specific anomalies fromcorpus-wide biases. Empirical evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o,Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, pro-viding the first proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and under-scoring the urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language mod"

Extensive experiments on benchmarks suchas Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioningperformance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO signif-icantly improves the performance of existing LVMs,effectively mitigating video-language misalignmentand hallucination. The code and data are available atVistaDPO Repository.1. IntroductionAchieving human-like reasoning capabilities for videos isa critical research topic in the field of AI. In recent years,Large Video Models (LVMs) (Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,2023a; Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024d; Wu et al., 2024a;Cheng et al., 2024b; Fei et al., 2024b; Jin et al., 2024;Qian et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025) have garnered signifi-cant research attention.

(a) Traditional textual DPO overlooks multimodal infor-mation, limiting video-language tasks. (b) Existing multimodalDPO methods rely on coarse alignment, missing rich temporal andperceptual details. (c&d) VistaDPO overcomes these limitationswith a hierarchical spatiotemporal preference optimization frame-work, enabling fine-grained video-language alignment and precisereasoning over video dynamics. Here, yw is the preferred responseover yl, and vw the visual input more likely to produce it than vl.(LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Peng et al.,2023; Dubey et al., 2024), LVMs leverage the powerful in-telligence of LLMs in language, achieving unprecedentedunderstanding of video content. However, increasing stud-ies reveal that LVMs encounter critical issues, such as videounderstanding that deviates from human intuition (Zhouet al., 2024a; Fei et al., 2024a; Cheng et al., 2024a; Hu et al.,2024) or the phenomenon of video hallucination (Wanget al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024), where themodel outputs content that does not align with the input, e.g.,user instructions, video content. The root of these issues liesin the inherent nature of current LVM architectures (Yanet al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2024b; Lin et al., 2023), wheremost LVMs integrate a video encoder (e.g., ViT) into text-oriented LLMs through a connector to achieve video signal1arXiv:2504.13122v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Preference Optimizationinterpretation. Since backbone LLMs undergo extensivepre-training on large-scale language data while video en-coders lack peer capability, this gap leads LLMs to produceoverly confident outputs based on biased or even incorrectperceptions of video content from the encoder. While the su-pervised fine-tuning (SFT) with video-language pairs (Wanget al., 2024; Leng et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024) can par-tially improve the alignment between the two modalities inLVMs, fundamentally addressing the issue requires relianceon extremely large-scale data.Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailovet al., 2024) has been proposed as a promising alternative toSFT. It trains LLMs to prefer responses chosen by evalua-tors over rejected ones when presented with a user query. Byidentifying which response better aligns with human pref-erences rather than requiring precise target outputs, DPOsignificantly alleviates dependence on annotated data whileenhancing alignment with human values and effectively ad-dressing hallucination issues. Some follow-up studies (Xieet al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024f; Zhou et al., 2024b; Fu et al.,2025b) have extended DPO from textual to multimodalLLMs, facilitating cross-modal alignment and improvingthe generalization capabilities of the models. Most recently,Hound-DPO (Zhang et al., 2024b) pioneers a video DPO,demonstrating that tailored rewards through DPO can signif-icantly enhance the performance of LVMs. Unfortunately,we find that this work straightforwardly applies the DPOstrategy designed for image-text LLMs to video-languagepreference alignment (as shown in Figure 1), which intro-duces two critical limitations. First, Zhang et al. (2024b)fails to adequately consider the temporal characteristics ofvideos. Unlike static images, videos always require bothspatial semantic understanding and dynamic temporal rea-soning (Fei et al., 2024c), necessitating a comprehensivemodeling of the spatial-temporal attributes of videos. Sec-ond, their work focuses solely on coarse-grained alignmentbetween video and language (response text) at the instancelevel, which may lead to suboptimal preference alignment(Zeng et al., 2024; Gunjal et al., 2024). We emphasize thatachieving proper alignment between two modalities requiresa fine-grained preference alignment. Intuitively, dynamicvideos correspond to paired text at multiple hierarchicallevels.To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework,Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct PreferenceOptimization (namely VistaDPO), aiming to strengthenLVMs. VistaDPO improves text-video preference alignmentacross hierarchical granularities. Specifically, we designthree levels of alignment (as shown in Figure 1):▶Instance Level: Matching the overall video content withthe most appropriate response for semantic alignment.▶Temporal Level: Aligning video temporal semanticswith event descriptions, enabling temporal reasoning.▶Perceptive Level: Aligning video spatial objects (i.e.,regions of interest) with objective tokens or phrases inthe language at a fine-grained semantic level.To implement such fine-grained preference optimization,we construct a large-scale spatial-temporally groundedvideo dataset called VistaDPO-7k. We manually anno-tate 3,878 videos with spatial-temporal groundings in avideo QA format, providing high-quality labels for halluci-nated and non-hallucinated answers, along with timestamps,keyframes, and bounding boxes of relevant semantics.We conduct extensive evaluation on benchmarks includ-ing Video Hallucination, Video QA, Captioning Tasks, bypost-training existing popular LVMs with the proposed Vis-taDPO. The results show that VistaDPO consistently im-proves baseline LVMs, achieving significant average im-provements of 26.42% over PLLaVA and 53.92% overVideo-LLaVA respectively. Through in-depth analysis, weshow that VistaDPO effectively and comprehensively cap-tures the dynamic interactions between video content andtexts, thanks to its hierarchical spatial-temporal alignmentstrategy. To summarize, this work contributes in threefold:• Propose a novel Video Hierarchical Spatial-TemporalDPO (VistaDPO) mechanism, a more fine-grained DPOstrategy to optimize the alignment between video andlanguage in LVMs.• Construct and release a large-scale (7.2K) high-qualityannotated QA pairs dataset, which can serve as a valuableresource for follow-up video DPO research.• Empirically, VistaDPO significantly improves the gener-alization capabilities of existing LVMs, effectively miti-gating video-language misalignment and hallucination.2. Related WorkBy building on powerful LLMs and integrating various mul-timodal encoders, researchers have developed MLLMs (Liuet al., 2024a; Fu et al., 2025a; Yin et al., 2024; Wu et al.,2024b) and LVMs (Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Linet al., 2023; Li et al., 2024d; Cheng et al., 2024b; Jin et al.,2024; Li et al., 2025). Through necessary SFT on visualinstruction-tuning data, MLLMs and LVMs have not onlydeveloped robust multimodal understanding capabilities buthave also significantly enhanced human-computer interac-tion, making cross-modal interactions more intuitive andseamless. Unfortunately, inheriting the intrinsic halluci-nation issues of LLMs, LVMs also frequently suffer fromhallucinations (Liu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024b; Liet al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024e) or fail to align their under-standing of visual content with human values. Increasingthe volume of multimodal SFT data has been shown to al-leviate these issues to some extent (Ahn et al., 2024; Tanet al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a). However,this approach is often accompanied by higher annotationcosts and computational expenses. This challenge is partic-2Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Preference Optimizationularly pronounced in video scenarios, where LVMs demandsignificantly larger datasets and higher training costs.Subsequently, the community has introduced the DPO tech-nique (Rafailov et al., 2024), where preference alignmentaligns LLMs with human values, reducing hallucinations byguiding the model’s adjustments using pairs of preferred andrejected data. Multimodal preference alignment, as an exten-sion of preference alignment techniques to visual and textualinputs, has been widely applied to MLLMs to improve cross-modal alignment (Liu et al., 2024f; Xie et al., 2024; Zhouet al., 2024b) as shown in Table 5. Recently, Hound-DPO,pioneered by Zhang et al. (2024b), successfully applies mul-timodal DPO to LVMs, improving video understanding andaddressing hallucination issues. However, it overlooks thepreference alignment of visual inputs. In this paper, we aimto further enhance the effectiveness of DPO in video sce-narios by modeling fine-grained alignments between videoand language. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchicalpreference optimization framework that efficiently capturesdynamic spatial-temporal dependencies in video tasks.3. PreliminariesDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al.,2024) aligns language models with human preferences, re-moving the need for explicit reward modeling or reinforce-ment learning (RL). Given a model πθ (the target model) anda reference policy πref (from supervised fine-tuning), the RLobjective in reinforcement learning with human feedback(RLHF), initialized with πθ = πref, is expressed as:maxπθ Ex∼D,y∼πθ(y|x)r(x, y)−βDKLπθ(y | x) ∥πref(y | x),(1)where r(x, y) denotes the reward function with x as theinput instruction and y as the response. DPO establishes amapping between the reward model and the optimal policyunder the reverse KL divergence, obtaining a representationof the reward function concerning the policy:r(x, y) = β log πθ(y|x)πref(y|x) + β log Z(x),(2)where β is a coefficient for the reverse KL divergencepenalty, and Z(x) is the partition function.Given the chosen response yw, preferred over the rejectedresponse yl, DPO aligns with human preference using theBradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons:PBT(yw ≻yl|x) =exp(r(x, yw))exp(r(x, yw)) + exp(r(x, yl)). (3)By substituting Eq. 2 into Eq. 3 and leveraging the negativelog-likelihood loss, DPO derives the objective function:u(x, yw, yl) = β log πθ(yw|x)πref(yw|x) −β log πθ(yl|x)πref(yl|x),LDPO = −E(x,yw,yl) [log σ (u(x, yw, yl))] ,(4)where the action score with yi denotes the i-th token of theresponse y can be formulated as:log π(y|x) =Xyi∈ylog p(yi|x, y<i).(5)4. VistaDPO-7k: A Spatial-temporalGrounded Video DPO DatasetExisting LVMs often suffer from limited spatial-temporalperception, leading to video-language misalignment andhallucination issues (Lan et al., 2024). We propose Vis-taDPO with spatial-temporal DPO to achieve fine-grainedalignment between video and language modalities. To sup-port this, we construct a spatial-temporal grounded dataset,VistaDPO-7k, by integrating data from 14 prevalentvideo datasets and systematically designing QA pairs toevaluate and mitigate hallucinations. These hallucinationsare categorized into two major dimensions: Perception (e.g.,Object, Static/Dynamic Attribute, Static Relation, OCR) andTemporal (e.g., Action, Dynamic Relation, Sequence), cov-ering both static and dynamic aspects of video understand-ing. The dataset provides chosen and rejected responses,along with fine-grained temporal dependencies that includekey timestamps, frames, and bounding boxes, enabling mod-els to better capture spatial-temporal interactions, as canbe shown in Figure 2(a). VistaDPO-7k supports multi-level preference optimization across Temporal, Perceptive,and Instance levels, offering a robust benchmark to reducehallucinations and enhance the spatial-temporal reasoningcapabilities of LVMs. Please refer to Appendix §B for moredetails on dataset construction and specifications.5. MethodologyTo tackle the spatiotemporal complexities in video-languagetasks, we propose VistaDPO, which implements hierarchicalpreference optimization across three aspects: (i) Instance-wise Semantic Preference Optimization, aligning prefer-ences at response and video levels; (ii) Temporal Action-Event Preference Optimization, capturing overlooked tem-poral dynamics; and (iii) Perceptive Spatial-Object Pref-erence Optimization, enabling fine-grained alignment be-tween tokens and objects.

To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR modelbased on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure,where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initialhigh-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In thesubsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scalewindow-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model toleverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, andattention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate thatRestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inferenceefficiency. The official code can be accessed at https://github.com/ClimBin/RestorMixer.1IntroductionImage restoration (IR) is a fundamental task in multimedia visual data processing, aimed at recovering high-quality, clearimages from degraded or damaged images. As a critical pre-processing step, IR significantly affects the performance ofdownstream visual applications, such as object detection [1], image segmentation [2], and video analysis [3]. Therefore,IR has become an integral component of modern visual system data processing pipelines.Traditionally, IR models have been designed for specific tasks, such as deraining [4, 5], desnowing [6, 7], and super-resolution (SR) [8, 9]. While these task-specific models typically achieve excellent performance, they are costly interms of development and deployment. Each task requires specialized architecture design and corresponding modelsettings, which lowers efficiency in both research and practical applications. With the rapid development of deeplearning technologies, there has been increasing interest in developing general-purpose IR models capable of handlingmultiple types of degradation within the same types of frameworks. These models have shown a tendency to eitherapproach or even surpass the performance of task-specific expert models. Such models not only reduce design and∗Equal contribution.†Corresponding author.arXiv:2504.10967v1 [cs.CV] 15 Apr 2025A PREPRINT - APRIL 16, 2025CNNTransformerMambaInput DependencyGlobal ViewSpeed andConsumption❌Certain Kernels✅Dynamic Weight Matrix✅Selective SSM❌Local Receptive Field✅Global Receptive Field✅Global Receptive Field✅Effiency❌Inefficiency✅Effiency𝒉’ = 𝒉+ 𝒙𝒚= 𝒉′𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑻𝒅𝒌 )𝑸𝑽𝑲WvWkWqFigure 1: Comparison of three mainstream architectures in terms of input dependency, global view, and inference speed.deployment costs but also promote scalability and adaptability across diverse IR tasks. Thus, general-purpose IRmodels represent a meaningful and promising research direction, as they can significantly lower development costswhile achieving performance comparable to expert models.Recent works have proposed general-purpose IR models, primarily focusing on three major architectures: ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN), Transformers, and Mamba-based architecture. Fig. 1 shows the advantages of differentdesign mechanisms. For instance, the CNN-based IRNeXt [10] leverages the efficiency and locality of convolutionsto effectively extract shallow features. Restormer [11] and SwinIR [12] are Transformer-based models that utilizevarious self-attention mechanisms to model global feature long-range dependencies and window-granularity featurerelationships, enhancing the model’s dynamic perception of features. These models outperform earlier CNN-basedmodels, though at the cost of slower inference speed. Additionally, the recently proposed Mamba [13] modelincorporates unique hardware-aware and parallel scanning mechanisms that accelerate global modeling, offeringa new foundational structure for IR models. For example, VmambaIR [14] and MambaIR [15] introduce innovativescanning mechanisms to establish global dependencies of visual features in multiple directions, addressing limitationsof the vanilla Mamba in handling visual data with non-causal relationships. However, they overlook issues of featureredundancy and computational deficiency caused by multi-directional scanning and memory loss due to long sequences.These methods offer diverse perspectives on general-purpose IR design, focusing on single-structure-based solutions,yet they overlook the potential benefits of integrating heterogeneous designs to address the diversified challenges of IRtasks. Consequently, existing general-purpose IR models often exhibit suboptimal performance due to the inability tofully exploit the complementary advantages of different architectural designs.To address the research gap in heterogeneous architecture design for general-purpose IR models, we propose RestorMixer- a novel hierarchical framework integrating complementary architectural paradigms. The model employs a three-stageencoder-decoder architecture with progressive downsampling/upsampling operations for multi-scale feature learning.Each stage is specifically optimized according to inherent scale characteristics: In the high-resolution initial stage,lightweight convolutional blocks efficiently extract shallow features through local receptive fields, prioritizing fine-grained detail preservation with minimal inference overhead. Subsequent stages implement a mixed architecture M-Tblocks combining: 1) Enhanced Memory Visual Mamba (EMVM) blocks for global dependency modeling, and 2)Multi-scale Window-based Transformer blocks that dynamically refine multi-ranged local representations throughattention-guided feature recalibration. This strategic integration synergizes CNN’s local inductive bias, Mamba’s linear-complexity global modeling, and Transformer’s adaptive feature optimization. Experimental validation demonstratesthat RestorMixer achieves leading performance on both single/mixed degradation benchmarks while maintainingsuperior inference efficiency, as shown in Fig. 2. In general, our contributions can be summarized as follows:• We analyze the limitations of existing general-purpose IR models that focus on single-architecture designparadigms and emphasize the necessity of adopting a mixed structure fusion approach to address the diverserequirements of IR.2A PREPRINT - APRIL 16, 2025Figure 2: Comparison of RestorMixer with various representative methods in terms of performance, inference speed,and number of parameters. Testing is at the same input size.• We propose RestorMixer, a multi-stage encoder-decoder IR model that effectively integrates CNN, Mamba, andTransformer. This design not only leverages the strengths of each design but also optimizes their combinationand collaboration based on the characteristics of features.• Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including single-degradation and mixed-degradationdatasets, we demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance while maintaining efficient inference.2Related Work2.1Image RestorationImage Restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. It is a central challenge inmultimedia data processing due to its ill-posed nature and diverse subtasks. Over the past decade, research has shiftedfrom traditional handcrafted feature extraction methods to data-driven deep neural network-based learning models,which have become mainstream due to their superior performance. Researchers have explored multiple subtasks,such as rain streak removal [4], super-resolution [8], and mixed degradation IR [16] et al. For example, Wang etal. [17] proposed a model for rain removal using local and non-local interactions and multi-scale deep learning. Insuper-resolution, SRCNN [9] pioneered the use of deep learning with a shallow convolutional neural network. Besides,Zhan et al.’s AnySR [8] further reconstructs arbitrary-scale super-resolution methods for flexible resource allocation.However, specialized models for specific degradations have limited generalizability. Recent research has focusedon developing general IR models [10, 11, 12, 15, 18] to handle multiple tasks with a single architecture. Existinggeneral-purpose IR models are based on single architectural frameworks like CNNs, Transformers, and state spacemodels (e.g., Mamba). CNN-based methods like MPRNet [19] and IRNeXt [10] offer robust feature extraction foruniversal restoration. Transformer-based models like Restormer [11] and SwinIR [12] capture long-range dependenciesbut face computational complexity issues. Recently, state space models such as Mamba [13] have gained attentionfor their computation ability and long-sequence modeling capabilities. Although CNNs have distinct advantages ininference speed, Transformers in global modeling, and Mamba in efficient long-range modeling, few studies haveexplored the integration of these triple heterogeneous foundational architectures for general-purpose IR.2.2State Space ModelsState space models (SSMs), originally inspired by classical control theory, have emerged as a novel backbone in deeplearning, particularly excelling in modeling long-sequence data. By incorporating linear extrapolation properties, thesemodels have achieved breakthrough progress in long-range dependency modeling, attracting significant research interest.Notably, Mamba [13], a new generation of input-dependent SSMs, has demonstrated Transformer-like performancein natural language processing (NLP), with computational complexity linear in input length, thanks to its selectivemechanism and hardware-efficient ability. The success of Mamba has spurred its application in vision tasks, includingimage classification [20] and biomedical image segmentation [21].

(c)Residual Depth CNN Block (RDCNN), built with a stack of basic residual convolutional units.Vision Mamba [24] have shown promise. In the IR domain, models such as MambaIR [15] and VMambaIR [14]have demonstrated significant potential. For example, MambaIR [15] combined visual SSMs with improved MLPto address local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy in traditional Mamba. However, Mamba’s unidirectionalscanning mechanism limits its performance in image data processing and in-context learning compared to Transformers.Although multi-directional scanning mechanisms have mitigated some of these limitations for non-causal image data,they introduce computational redundancy and insufficient local feature association. To address these challenges, thiswork introduces an optimized scanning mechanism in the encoder-decoder’s latter two low-resolution feature processingstages, combining Mamba with a simple multi-scale window-based Transformer structure. This approach effectivelyresolves issues of computational redundancy and insufficient local feature association.3The Proposed Model: RestorMixer3.1Overview of ArchitectureWe introduce RestorMixer, a novel IR model that integrates heterogeneous structures. Fig. 3 (a) shows that RestorMixerdiffers from prior single-structure models (e.g., CNN, Transformer, Vision Mamba) by combining three foundationaldesigns tailored to the feature properties processed at different encoder/decoder stages, ensuring synergistic interaction.The model comprises two main blocks: the Residual Depth CNN Block (RDCNN) and the Mamba-TransformerBlock (M-T), distinguished by colored blocks in Fig. 3 (a). Given a degraded input image Ilow ∈RH×W ×C, themodel first adopts a CNN stem to expand input channels, yielding I′low ∈RH×W ×C (with C = 32 channels). Theencoding process involves three stages, each handling features at different scales. Specifically, I′ passes through theResidual Depth CNN Block (RDCNN), as shown in Fig. 3 (c) to extract shallow features I1e ∈RH×W ×C, followed bya convolutional downsampling layer that halves the spatial scale and doubles the channels to produce I2e ∈RH2 × W2 ×2C.I2e is then concatenated with the corresponding downsampled input features I′/2 ∈RH2 × W2 ×C and fed into the M-TBlock (as shown in Fig. 3 (b)). This process continues to generate three multi-scale feature maps in the encoder. Inthe decoder, M-T Blocks process lower-resolution feature maps, while RDCNN block handles the highest-resolutionfeatures. Additionally, we employ a deep supervision strategy during optimization, enabling each decoder stage toproduce predictions at corresponding scales for loss calculation against reference images. Next, we detail the threefoundational blocks comprising RestorMixer.3.2The Heterogeneous Designed ModulesRestorMixer combines three main heterogeneous structures with a focus on enhancing module collaboration.

For two lower-resolution stages, modules based on Mamba and Transformerarchitectures are alternated to model long-range dependencies and refine local representations.3.2.1Residual Depth CNN BlockWe designed the Residual Depth CNN Block (RDCNN) to process first-stage input features, which integrates standardconvolution and depthwise separable convolution, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). For an input feature map X ∈RH×W ×C, thespatial feature extraction is formulated as:Y1 = GELU (BN (Conv3×3(X))) ,(1)where BN(·) and GELU(·) are the Batch Normalization and the activation function, respectively. Standard 3 × 3convolution captures fine-grained local textures and high-frequency patterns critical for IR, such as edge reconstructionand noise suppression. Subsequent processing employs a depthwise separable convolution to decouple spatial filteringand channel interaction:Ydw = Depth-Conv3×3(Y1),Ypw = Point-Conv1×1(Ydw),(2)which reduce the computational complexity from O(CinCoutK2) to O(Cout(K2 + Cin)). This design leverages thecomplementary strengths of both operations: the standard convolution preserves spatially correlated details essentialfor pixel-wise restoration, while the depthwise separable convolution minimizes redundant parame","Image restoration (IR), as a fundamental multimedia data processing task, has a significant impact ondownstream visual applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost andcomplexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architec-tural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereasTransformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts.While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts"

Poonawala a,aUniversity of Kentucky, USAStability analysis of dynamical systems, particularly forpiecewise aﬃne (PWA) systems, plays a critical role incontrol theory and various engineering applications. Akey aspect of stability analysis is the estimation of the re-gion of attraction (RoA), which deﬁnes the set of initialconditions from which the system will converge to a spe-ciﬁc equilibrium point. Robust performance against dis-turbances and faults is essential in dynamical systems.Hence, enlarging the RoA is necessary, particularly insafety-critical applications like robotics, aerospace, andautomotive control, where resilience to disturbances isimportant [19,29].Lyapunov functions serve as a fundamental tool in non-linear stability analysis by providing a means to estimatethe RoA.

Such approaches have been ap-⋆This paper was not presented at any IFAC meet-ing.CorrespondingauthorHasanA.Poonawala.hasan.poonawala@uky.eduEmail addresses: psa254@uky.edu (Pouya Samanipour),hasan.poonawala@uky.edu (Hasan A. Poonawala).plied both to dynamics identiﬁed via NNs [7] and to NN-based controllers [7,26,27]. Nonetheless, determining asuitable Lyapunov function for these ReLU-based dy-namics remains challenging, primarily because of theirinherent nonlinearity. This challenge is also prevalentin explicit model predictive control (MPC), where thecontrol law is PWA and ﬁnding Lyapunov functions forstability analysis continues to be an open problem [3,6]. Several computational approaches have been devel-oped to address these challenges. The Sum of Squares(SOS) method, implemented through semideﬁnite pro-gramming (SDP), provides a framework for analyzing lo-cal stability and estimating RoAs [14]. Another commonstrategy employs piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunovfunctions [15,25]. A critical limitation of these methodslies in the inherent conservatism introduced by the S-procedure. The conservatism can be mitigated by usingpiecewise aﬃne (PWA) Lyapunov functions, which canbe formulated without additional conservatism, as op-posed to their PWQ counterparts. Previously, we devel-oped a linear optimization problem based on PWA pa-rameterizations of the Lyapunov function over the pre-selected domain [24,25].Beyond these structured function classes, neural net-works (NNs) provide a ﬂexible alternative for learningLyapunov functions.

Three diﬀerent approaches for selection of the domainover which Lyapunov stability conditions are enforced whencomputationally searching for Lyapunov functions.imation theorem [12], NNs can approximate any contin-uous function arbitrarily well, making them well-suitedfor learning Lyapunov functions from ﬁnite samples.Sampling-based methods have been particularly suc-cessful in identifying Lyapunov functions that satisfystability conditions in the state space [1, 17, 21]. How-ever, these approaches require veriﬁcation to ensurecorrectness, which can be performed inexactly throughrelaxed convex formulations [11] or exactly using formalmethods such as Satisﬁability Modulo Theories (SMT)and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) [1,4,5,7–10,28].Exact veriﬁcation is critical for conﬁrming Lyapunovconditions or identifying counterexamples to reﬁne can-didate functions. Despite their success, scalability andeﬃciency remain persistent challenges, particularly forhigh-dimensional systems.Despite advancements in both PWQ and PWA Lya-punov formulations, as well as neural network-based ap-proaches, existing methods typically apply the searchprocedure to the entire domain, as illustrated in Fig. 1a.Due to the fact that there is no guarantee that all theinitial conditions in the domain will converge to equi-librium, checking Lyapunov conditions over the entiredomain is a computationally ineﬃcient and unnecessarystep [27]. To check the Lyapunov conditions over an in-variant set for discrete-time dynamics, [27] proposed asampling-based method, as shown in Fig. 1b. An itera-tive process was used to develop a certiﬁable RoA in thatstudy. It is important to note that there is no guaran-tee that continuing to iterate will result in a larger RoA(see Section 2). In addition, the certiﬁed invariant setis derived by checking the future states in discrete-timedynamics, which are easier to compute.To address these challenges for continuous PWA dy-namics, we propose a new method that restricts theLyapunov search algorithm to a certiﬁed invariantset. As shown in Fig. 1c, we introduce SequentialEstimation of RoA based on Invariant Set Estimation(SEROAISE), a sequential method to ﬁnd PWA RoAover a certiﬁed invariant set using a PWA barrier func-tion. An invariant set estimation is a modiﬁcation of themethod described in [22]. As an additional feature, theNon-Uniform Growth of the Invariant Set (NUGIS)is introduced in order to facilitate the growth of theinvariant set. Our key contributions are as follows:• We propose a novel concept called Non-uniformGrowth of Invariant Sets (NUGIS), which enablesthe invariant set to expand non-uniformly, providinggreater ﬂexibility in constructing larger sets.• We present a novel framework, Iterative Invariant SetEstimation (IISE), for identifying certiﬁed invariantsets for ReLU-based dynamical systems. This frame-work builds on our previous work [22] and allows theestimation of signiﬁcantly larger certiﬁed invariantsets for PWA dynamical systems.• We propose SEROAISE, a sequential method thatidentiﬁes a larger RoA compared to state-of-the-arttechniques, validated through non-trivial examples.2SEROAISE OverviewWe are interested in determining the Region of Attrac-tion (RoA) for dynamical systems driven by PiecewiseAﬃne (PWA) functions as follows:˙x = PWA(x),x ∈D(1)where PWA is deﬁned over a pre-selected domain D ⊂Rn.In our previous work [24, 25], we tackled the challengeof automatically obtaining a certiﬁed Lyapunovfunction and RoA for PWA dynamical systems andtheir equivalent ReLU neural networks, as shown in Fig-ure 1a. Although eﬀective, this method checks Lyapunovconditions across the entire pre-selected domain D. Asobserved in [27], checking the Lyapunov conditions at2states in D that lie outside the region of attraction re-sults in unnecessary constraints on the parameters ofthe Lyapunov function. These additional constraints in-troduce conservatism in the form of a smaller region ofattraction. To avoid these issues, Yang et. al. [27] en-force Lyapunov conditions on states belonging to an es-timate of the RoA. The authors resolve the chicken-and-egg problem by initializing an estimate of the RoA us-ing linear systems techniques near the origin, and thenusing samples from outside its boundary to update theparameters of a candidate Lyapunov function, enablinga cyclic bootstrapping process. Once this samples-basedtraining cycle is ended, a sound veriﬁcation technique isused to ﬁnd a valid region of attraction as a level set ofthe candidate Lyapunov function.Rather than relying on Lyapunov stability conditions toﬁnd the RoA, our objective is to relax these requirementsto barrier function conditions. The region of attractionof an equilibrium is also a forward invariant set. Insteadof estimating this RoA using Lyapunov stability condi-tions, we may use conditions for a barrier function toﬁnd a certiﬁed invariant set. This idea is motivated byLaSalle’s theorem, which ensures asymptotic stability ininvariant sets.Theorem 1 (LaSalle’s theorem [16]) Let S ⊆D ⊂Rn be a compact set that is forward invariant for thefollowing dynamical systems.˙x = fcl(x).(2)Let V : D →R be a diﬀerentiable function such that˙V (x) ≤0 in S. Let E ⊆S be the set where ˙V (x) = 0.Let Ω⊆E be the largest invariant set in E. Then, everysolution starting in S approaches Ωas t →∞.Corollary 2 If a continuously diﬀerentiable function Vexists such that ˙V (x) < 0 in S \ {0} and ˙V (0) = 0, thenthe forward invariant set S estimates the RoA, i.e.,S ⊆RoA.PROOF. Let x(t) be a solution of (2) starting in S.Given the assumption that ˙V (x) < 0 for all x ∈S \ {0}and ˙V (0) = 0, we conclude that E = {0} , where E isthe set of points in S at which ˙V (x) = 0. By Theorem 1,every solution of (2) that starts within S will approachthe equilibrium point at the origin as t →∞. Since S isforward invariant, solutions starting in S remain withinS for all future time. Thus, S includes initial conditionsthat will converge to the equilibrium without leaving S.Therefore, S ⊆RoA.SEROAISE is developed to take advantage of invariantset conditions in order to obtain larger RoA estimates.SEROAISE introduces a framework that ﬁnds alarge RoA by identifying a large certiﬁed invari-ant subset and applying Lyapunov-like conditionsto states inside this subset. Our framework beginsby ﬁnding a large certiﬁed invariant subset for PWA dy-namic (1). While [22] proposed a method for this, it hasdrawbacks:(1) Guaranteed Growth: If we aim to enlarge an in-variant subset obtained using [22], there is no guar-antee that the new subset will exist.(2) Linear α(x): Using the linear form of α(x) in bar-rier function constraints as described in [22] re-stricts the search space and excludes potentiallylarger invariant sets.(3) Boundary Point Exclusion: The work in [22]searches for the invariant subset on the interior ofD, which is conservative compared to searching overits closure.For the purpose of addressing these issues, we ﬁrst in-troduce Non-Uniform Growth of the Invariant Set(NUGIS). NUGIS, Section 4.2, enables the expan-sion of the invariant subset with a guarantee so that thelimitations of Gauranteed Growth can be overcome.Building on this, our Iterative Invariant Set Estima-tion (IISE) algorithm, Section 5, enhances [22] by us-ing nonlinear α(x) to capture larger sets to tackle Lin-ear α(x), and including boundary points to deal withBoundary Point Exclusion. Our ﬁnal step is to in-tegrate IISE into SEROAISE, Section 6, a sequentialframework that estimates the RoA eﬃciently.3PreliminariesTo begin, we brieﬂy introduce the necessary notationsand provide an overview of PWA functions, barrier func-tions, and invariant sets.NotationLet S be a set. The set of indices corre-sponding to the elements of S is denoted by I(S). Theconvex hull, interior, boundary, and closure of S are de-noted by conv (S), Int (S), ∂S, and S, respectively.For a matrix A, AT denotes its transpose. The inﬁnitynorm is denoted by | · |∞. Additionally, it is importantto note that the symbol ⪰has the same element-wiseinterpretation as ≥.As part of this paper, we present a deﬁnition of the PWAdynamical systems on a partition. As a result, the par-tition is deﬁned as follows:Deﬁnition 3 Throughout this paper, the partition P isa collection of subsets {Xi}i∈I(P), where each Xi repre-sents a closed subset of Rn for all i ∈I(P). In partitionP, Dom(P) = ∪i∈I(P)Xi and Int (Xi) ∩Int (Xj) = ∅fori ̸= j.3Another concept that we need is the reﬁnement of apartition. In mathematical terms, given two partitionsP = {Yi}i∈I and R = {Zj}j∈J of a set S = Dom (P) =Dom (R), we say that R is a reﬁnement of P if Zj∩Yi ̸= ∅implies that Zj ⊆Yi.Furthermore, we use dim(Xi) to indicate the dimensionsof a cell Xi where i ∈I(P).3.1Piecewise Aﬃne FunctionsA piecewise aﬃne function, denoted by PWA(x), is rep-resented through an explicit parameterization based ona partition P = {Xi}i∈I(P). Each region in the parti-tion corresponds to a set of aﬃne dynamics, describedby a collection of matrices AP = {Ai}i∈I(P) and vec-tors aP = {ai}i∈I(P). The PWA function is deﬁned asfollows:PWA(x) = Aix + ai,if x ∈Xi,(3)where the region(cell) Xi is deﬁned by nhi hyperplanesas follows:Xi = {x ∈Rn : Eix + ei ⪰0},(4)with matrices Ei ∈Rnhi×n and vectors ei ∈Rnhi, whichdeﬁne the boundary hyperplanes of the region Xi.Assumption 4 For the purpose of this research, all cellsin partitions are assumed to be bounded polytopes. There-fore, the vertex representation of the PWA dynamics isapplicable. The cell Xi can be represented mathematicallyas the convex hull of its set of vertices, F0(Xi), as follows:Xi = conv{F0(Xi)}.(5)3.2SafetyTo explain the concepts of safety, consider dynamicalsystem (2), as locally Lipschitz continuous within thedomain D ⊂Rn. Based on this assumption, for any ini-tial condition x0 ∈D, there is a time interval I(x0) =[0, τmax) within which a unique solution x(t) exists, ful-ﬁlling the diﬀerential equation (2) and the initial condi-tion x0 [2].Deﬁnition 5 (Forward invariant set [2]) Let us de-ﬁne a superlevel set S corresponding to a continuouslydiﬀerentiable function h : D ⊂Rn →R for the closed-loop system fcl given by equation (2) as follows:S ={x ∈D : h(x) ≥0},(6)The set S is considered forward-invariant if the solutionx(t) remains in S for all t ∈I(x0) for every x0. If S isforward invariant, the system described by equation (2)is considered safe with respect to the set S.Deﬁnition 6 (Barrier function [2]) Let S ⊂D ⊆Rn represent the superlevel set of a continuously diﬀer-entiable function h(x). It is said that h(x) is a barrierfunction if there exists an extended class K∞function αin which:Lfclh(x) ≥−α(h(x)),for all x ∈D,(7)where lie derivative of h(x) along the closed loop dynam-ics fcl is denoted by Lfclh(x).4Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant SetIn this section, we introduce the Non-Uniform Growthof Invariant Set (NUGIS) method, which addresses theGauranteed Growth, challenge 1. In order to over-come this limitation, NUGIS identiﬁes vertices on theboundary of the invariant set that can be incorporatedinto a larger, newly certiﬁed invariant set. NUGIS hasthe major advantage of guaranteeing the existence of alarger PWA invariant set. We begin by deﬁning the pa-rameterization of the barrier function, followed by a the-orem formalizing NUGIS.4.1Barrier Function ParametrizationWe parameterize the barrier function as a PWA functionon the same partition as the dynamical systems (1). Weexpressed the PWA barrier function and its correspond-ing invariant set using h(x, P, α(x)) and S(P, α(x)) todemonstrate their dependence on partition and choosingα(x).

While traditional approaches search for Lyapunov functionsby enforcing Lyapunov conditions over pre-selected domains, this framework enforces Lyapunov-like conditions over a certiﬁedinvariant subset obtained using the Iterative Invariant Set Estimator(IISE). Compared to the state-of-the-art, IISE providessystematically larger certiﬁed invariant sets. In order to ﬁnd a larger invariant subset, the IISE utilizes a novel concept known asthe Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant Set (NUGIS). A number of examples illustrating the eﬃcacy of the proposed methodsare provided, including dynamical systems derived from learning algorithms.

The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existingmethods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors thatwere used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited addi-tional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual SimilarityAggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-rankingmethod that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage othertypes of available side information. This can for example be other sensordata (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) orgeometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In manyapplications this information is already present or can be acquired withlow effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors toallow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Twolarge-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization sce-narios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we showsignificant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also forthe downstream visual localization task.Keywords: Image retrieval re-ranking · Visual localization · GNN1IntroductionThe Visual Place Recognition (VPR) problem is often framed as finding the mostsimilar images in a database for a given query image, sometimes called imageretrieval. The task appears in the back-end of many vision pipelines, e.g. byproviding a coarse camera pose for visual localization [31], identifying potentialloop closures in SLAM [24], or selecting co-visible image pairs to match in large-scale Structure-from-Motion [35]. Most state-of-the-art approaches are basedon global image descriptors that are used to efficiently compute the similaritybetween the query and the reference images.To improve the VPR results re-ranking methods [7,28,9,10,36] can be ap-plied, which aim to re-order the top images found in the database. Images thatare relevant to the query should increase in rank and vice versa. While the initialretrieval is based on independently comparing descriptor similarity between thearXiv:2504.11134v1 [cs.CV] 15 Apr 20252Hanning et al.QueryimageDatabase12341234Fθ1. Image Description2.

(1) For each image aglobal image descriptor is computed, e.g. using [2,13]. (2) An initial ordering is estab-lished by comparing descriptor similarity between the query and database descriptors.(3) Our proposed method (GCSA) takes the top-scoring descriptors, together withother side information, and re-ranks them to improve the accuracy of the retrieval.query and database, the re-ranking methods can jointly consider the set of imagedescriptors. Further, by considering a smaller number of retrieved images (com-pared to the size of the database), one can allow more computationally complexmethods. However, most algorithms re-rank based on the same descriptors thatwere used for the initial retrieval – meaning that no new information is added.In this work we leverage additional side information associated with each image,beyond the visual image descriptors, to help guide the re-ranking process. Weare motivated by downstream applications where this side information is oftenalready available or can be acquired cheaply. For example, many devices canrecord the radio signal strength (WiFi/BlueTooth) of nearby endpoints whichcan provide strong cues for resolving ambiguities due to visual aliasing (e.g. sim-ilar offices on different floors). In the localization context, camera poses for themap (database) images are generally known and can provide information aboutwhich reference images might be co-visible.We take inspiration from the Contextual Similarity Aggregation (CSA) byOuyang et al. [25], in which the visual similarity between each image and a setof anchor images (top scoring images) are encoded in a so-called affinity featurevector. We extend the affinity-based representation to other modalities (e.g.radio signal strength), which allows us to have a shared representation acrossdifferent types of inputs. In our proposed method, which we call GeneralizedContextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), these generalized affinity features,encoding both the visual and non-visual information, are then refined by a graphneural network through self-attention. Descriptor similarity between the updatedfeatures is used to re-rank the retrieved images. In addition to integrating thenon-visual side information we propose several improvements in the architectureof [25]. Our experiments both validate our proposed changes and show thatintegrating this side information significantly improves re-ranking performance.An overview of our method can be seen in Fig. 1.Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information32Related WorkVisual place recognition has been developed within several sub-fields in thecomputer vision community, e.g. for re-localization and loop closure in visualSLAM. Most methods compute some type of global image descriptor which isused to retrieve similar images. Some methods re-purpose local feature descrip-tors for this task, which is an attractive option in low-compute or real-timeapplications such as visual SLAM. Valgren and Lilienthal [38] directly use thelocal descriptor similarities, while others use bag-of-words [1,8], Fisher vectors[26] or VLAD [14] to aggregate into a global descriptor. Another class of meth-ods instead directly compute an image embedding from the raw image data,with most approaches [42,2,13] being based on deep learning. These are typi-cally trained using contrastive learning [23] or via classification losses [5], wheremining strategies are often employed to find informative training batches [2,12].For our experiments, we use NetVLAD [2] as it is a popular choice in visuallocalization [31,32] and DINOv2 SALAD [13] as a representative of the currentstate-of-the-art.Additional information in image retrieval has in previous work beenshown to be useful in a couple of different contexts. In medical image retrieval,combinations of image and text are used as queries in [6,44]. Similarly, image re-trieval where the query descriptors are augmented using an additional query texthas been considered [18]. This can be used, e.g. for product search for clothing[4]. This is referred to as composed image retrieval [40] and in [37] the problemis solved using a multi-modal transformer-based architecture. Other methodsuse side information to filter the database images before retrieval. [41] suggestusing coarse GPS priors to remove database positions that are far away, and [32]similarly used radio signatures to filter. In our ablation studies (Section 5.2) wecompare against similar filtering techniques and show that jointly consideringthe visual and non-visual information gives best performance.Image retrieval re-ranking: Many different methods have been suggestedto re-rank the initially retrieved database images. Geometric verification [27]uses local feature matching to discard database images having few matches withthe query image. However, depending on the complexity of the local featurematching this can quickly become intractable. Query expansion (QE) computesa new query descriptor as a weighted average of the original query and theretrieved database descriptors. The descriptors can either be equally weighted(AQE [7]), weighted by similarity (αQE [28]) or by rank (AQEwD [9]). LAttQE[10], a neural network with self-attention, learns the expansion weights from data.The SuperGlobal [36] image retrieval system includes a re-ranking phase wherethe database and query descriptors are refined in two different ways followed byre-ordering based on the similarity scores between the refined descriptors. Theworks most similar to ours are [45,25], which compute new features that encodethe visual similarity with database images in a neighborhood around the querydescriptor. The features are refined and the database images re-ranked accordingto the cosine similarity between the refined database and query features.4Hanning et al.ImagesSideinfo(Positional, Heading, Radio, etc.)Fθ {di}Ws(·, ·){avisi}sx(·, ·){axi }[·∥·]GNN{˜ai}Fig. 2. Architecture of the GCSA network. The image descriptors {di} are extractedwith the network Fθ and then projected by the matrix W before computing the visualaffinity features {avisi}. These are optionally concatenated with the non-visual affinityvectors {axi } after which the features are refined by a GNN using self-attention.3Learning to Improve Image RetrievalWe consider the image retrieval problem where we are given a query image I0and want to find the most similar images from a collection of references im-ages, I1, . . . , IM. Depending on the application, image similarity can be definedin different ways. In the context of localization, we might consider proximity(how close are the cameras), covisibility (overlap between viewing frustums) ormatchability (can we establish feature correspondences between the images).Other applications might consider semantic similarity, i.e. do the images havesimilar content, but not necessarily are they capturing the same scene. In thispaper we will focus on the former.The most common paradigm is to use global image descriptors, where eachimage is summarized in a single high-dimensional feature vector and the pair-wise distances between these vectors are used as a proxy for image similarity.Typically, a deep neural network Fθ (e.g. [2,13]) produce the descriptors,Fθ(Ii) = di ∈RD,(1)where D is the feature dimension. The descriptor similarity between the querydescriptor d0 and reference descriptors d1, . . . , dM induces an initial ranking ofthe references images, from which we can extract the top K most similar images.In the following sections we present our approach for improving (re-ranking)this initial retrieval by leveraging additional side information not present in theoriginal image descriptors.3.1Re-ranking with Contextual SimilarityGiven the top K retrieved images, our goal is now to re-order this set to improvethe retrieval. For notational convenience, re-number the images s.t. I1, . . . , IKrepresent the initial retrievals in order and let d1, . . . , dK denote their corre-sponding descriptors. We propose to use a GNN-based architecture inspired bythe Contextual Similarity Aggregation introduced by Ouyang et al. [25]. The ideain [25] is to use affinity features, which encode the similarity between each imageVisual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information5and the top-scoring images (including the query). For each di the correspond-ing visual affinity feature is computed by concatenating the pairwise descriptorsimilarities:avisi= [s(di, d0), s(di, d1), . . . , s(di, dL)].(2)Here avisi∈RL+1 and i ∈0, 1, . . . , K, L ≤K. These features are then passedto a GNN [34] which produces a set of refined descriptors {˜ai} that is used tore-order the images. Note that for L = 0, the new features {avisi} induce thesame ordering as the original descriptors {di}, but when L > 0 a larger contextis considered.We improve on CSA [25] in three ways. First, the similarity metric usedto compute the affinity vectors avisiis learned. Specifically we learn a linearprojection W ∈RD0×D, such thats(di, dj) = scos (Wdi, Wdj),(3)where scos is the regular cosine similarity scos (u, v) =uT v∥u∥∥v∥. Our experiments(Section 5.2) show that learning this projection significantly improves the re-ranking. Secondly, while CSA is trained with contrastive and MSE loss, we showthat replacing these with the quantized AP loss [29] further enhances the results.Finally, we incorporate non-visual side information into the re-ranking. In thefollowing sections we detail how this is combined with the visual descriptors.3.2Integrating Non-visual Side InformationThe concept of affinity features can naturally be extended to include other in-formation, e.g. database image poses or data from additional sensors. Given anaffinity measure sx(Ii, Ij) we constructaxi = [sx(Ii, I0), sx(Ii, I1), . . . , sx(Ii, IL)],(4)where axi ∈RL+1 and i ∈0, 1, . . . , K. If the side information is not available (ormeaningful) for the query image, we simply omit the first element of axi , andin this case we define the affinity vector for the query ax0 to be the zero vector.These non-visual affinity vectors are then appended onto avisi, creating the fullaffinity feature vector ai, which is then passed to the GNN for refinement.In the following sections, we detail how these affinities can be computedfor some examples: camera poses, compass heading, and radio-signal strength.However, there are many other interesting options, which might be useful (e.g.floor number in multi-story buildings) and would be easy to integrate into thesame framework. An overview of the architecture is visualized in Fig. 2.Positional Affinity For images that are geo-located with GPS position andheading angle we suggest a positional affinity in the form of 2D field-of-view(FoV) overlap [16], parameterized by the angle θ and radius r. The area of theoverlap is normalized by dividing with the FoV area for a single image, resulting6Hanning et al.in a value in the [0, 1] range which we denote spos(Ii, Ij). The resulting affinityvector aposi∈RL, computed for i ∈1, . . . , K, isaposi= [spos(Ii, I1), spos(Ii, I2), . . . , spos(Ii, IL)].(5)Heading Affinity In some use cases (e.g. for an autonomous agent equippedwith camera and compass) it is reasonable to assume that the heading angle ofthe query image is also known. Heading information is encoded in the vectorahdgi= [shdg(Ii, I0), shdg(Ii, I1), . . . , shdg(Ii, IL)],(6)where ahdgi∈RL+1 and i ∈0, 1, . . . , K. The element shdg(Ii, Ij) is the normal-ized absolute heading difference between images Ii and Ij with heading anglesαi and αj (assumed to be in the [0, 2π) range):shdg(Ii, Ij) = 1 −2 min(|αi −αj|, 2π −|αi −αj|)/π.(7)Radio Affinity From observed radio (e.g. WiFi and BlueTooth) signal strengthswe compute a radio descriptor δi = [δi,1, δi,2, . . . , δi,Nr] ∈RNr for each imageIi where δi,j is the approx. distance in meters to the jth radio signal source [30]:δi,j = min10(27.55+|si,j|)/20fj, δmax,j ∈1, . . . , Nr.(8)Here si,j is the signal strength in dBm, fj the frequency in MHz, δmax an upperdistance threshold and Nr the total number of radio signals. If a signal is notregistered the corresponding distance is set to δmax. The radio affinity of twoimages is given by srad(Ii, Ij) = 1−β∥δi −δj∥2, where β is a scale factor chosenso that srad(Ii, Ij) is in the [−1, 1] range. Finally the full radio affinity vectoraradi∈RL+1, for a query or database image, can be expressed asaradi= [srad(Ii, I0), srad(Ii, I1), . . . , srad(Ii, IL)],i ∈0, 1, . . . , K.(9)3.3Message Passing with Self-attentionAfter concatenation the affinity features are refined using scaled dot-productattention [39] in the same way as in [25]. In short, we set up a fully-connectedgraph where the nodes are the query and top K database images and initializethe node features {x0i } as x0i ←¯Wai, where ¯W ∈R ¯D×Da is a second learnedprojection matrix and Da the dimension of the affinity vector ai. In each layerl of the GNN the messages {mli} are computed using standard multi-head self-attention and the node features are updated according toxl+1i←xli + mli + MLP(LN(xli + mli)).(10)Here LN denotes layer normalizati",The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use

Recent strides, particularly leveraging reinforcementlearning (RL) with large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated significant potential intackling complex mathematical problems demanding logical deduction, symbolic manipulation,and multi-step reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Team, 2024; xAI, 2025; Google, 2025).Notably, methods like RL-Zero (Guo et al., 2025), which employ online RL guided by binary rewardsfrom verifiable answers, have surpassed traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches.Despite this promise, the advancement of these powerful RL techniques is critically hampered by abottleneck: the scarcity of suitable training data. Existing mathematical datasets (Hendrycks et al.,2021b; Cobbe et al., 2021a; Yu et al., 2024; Toshniwal et al., 2024) often fall short in several key aspects.They may lack the extreme difficulty needed to push the boundaries of current models, miss theverifiable answer format essential for rule-based RL reward schemes, suffer from contaminationwith standard evaluation benchmarks (compromising evaluation integrity), or are simply insufficientin scale, particularly concerning highly challenging problems. While human-annotated datasetstailored for RL (Wang et al., 2024; Face, 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025b; Yu et al., 2025; Dang& Ngo, 2025; Albalak et al., 2025) provide valuable insights, they often struggle with scale andcapturing the extreme difficulty characteristic of competitive mathematics, which is necessary fortraining state-of-the-art reasoners.To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a novel, large-scale mathematical datasetspecifically engineered to accelerate the development of advanced reasoning models via reinforce-ment learning. DeepMath-103K is distinguished by its high concentration of challenging mathemat-ical problems, significantly surpassing the difficulty distribution prevalent in existing open datasets(Figure 1a). Our dataset construction methodology incorporates rigorous data decontaminationagainst a comprehensive suite of benchmarks (Figure 4) to ensure trustworthy evaluation, alongsidefiltering for problems predominantly at high difficulty levels (≥5).Crucially, every problem within DeepMath-103K features a verifiable final answer, directly enablingthe application of rule-based reward functions in RL frameworks. Furthermore, each problem isaccompanied by three distinct R1-generated solutions (Guo et al., 2025), offering rich data fordiverse training paradigms such as supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, or model distillation(Figure 2). The dataset covers a broad spectrum of mathematical topics (Figure 3), ranging fromfoundational concepts to advanced subjects, thereby promoting the development of generalizablereasoning abilities. Comprising approximately 103K problems — including 95K curated challengingexamples (Levels 5-10) and 8K supplementary problems (Levels 3-5) — DeepMath-103K representsa significant contribution toward equipping the community with the resources required to trainhighly proficient mathematical reasoners.We validate the effectiveness of DeepMath-103K by demonstrating that models trained on it achievesubstantial performance gains on several demanding mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Thiswork furnishes a vital, openly accessible resource, tackling the urgent need for large-scale, chal-lenging, verifiable, and clean mathematical data essential for propelling the next generation of AIreasoning systems.Our main contributions are as follows:• We design and release DeepMath-103K, a novel large-scale mathematical dataset specificallycurated for training advanced reasoning models via reinforcement learning, characterized byits high difficulty, verifiable answers, multiple diverse solutions per problem, and rigorousdecontamination.• We detail a meticulous data curation pipeline, encompassing source analysis, extensivedecontamination against standard benchmarks for evaluation integrity, difficulty filtering,and robust answer verification.2A Large-Scale Challenging Mathematical Dataset for Advancing Reasoning• We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepMath-103K by showing that models trainedon it achieve significant improvements on multiple challenging mathematical reasoningbenchmarks, particularly using RL-Zero techniques enabled by the dataset’s structure.2Overview of DeepMath-103KQuestion: Calculate the line integral , over the ellipse , where the vector fields are given by: .

As illustrated in Figure 2, asingle sample includes the following components:• Question: The mathematical problem statement.• Final Answer: A verifiable final answer, crucial for enabling rule-based reward functions inRL settings.• Difficulty: A numerical difficulty score, which facilitates techniques like difficulty-awaretraining (e.g., curriculum learning) or adaptive compute allocation based on problemcomplexity (Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024).• Topic: A hierarchical topic classification for the problem, enabling topic-specific analysis ortraining.• R1 Solutions: Three distinct reasoning paths generated by the DeepSeek-R1 model (Guoet al., 2025), suitable for diverse training paradigms.DeepMath-103K possesses several key characteristics that make it particularly suitable for advancingmathematical reasoning research:Higher DifficultyDeepMath-103K includes mathematical problems spanning difficulty levels 3through 10. The dataset comprises 95K challenging problems (levels 5-10) specifically curated for thisresearch, augmented with an additional 8K problems (levels 3-5) sourced from SimpleRL (Zeng et al.,2025b) to ensure broader difficulty coverage. For comparison, we analyzed and labeled the difficultylevels of several existing datasets commonly used for RL training in this domain: Open-RS (Dang& Ngo, 2025), DAPO-17K (Yu et al., 2025), DeepScaleR-Preview (Luo et al., 2025b), ORZ-129K (Huet al., 2025), and Open-R1 (Face, 2025). Figure 1a illustrates the difficulty distributions acrossthese datasets. As depicted, DeepMath-103K exhibits a significantly more challenging problemdistribution, containing a substantially higher proportion of problems at difficulty levels 5 and abovecompared to the other benchmark datasets. This focus on higher difficulty is intended to push thereasoning limits of current models.3A Large-Scale Challenging Mathematical Dataset for Advancing ReasoningCalculusAlgebraPrecalculusApplied MathematicsGeometryDiscrete MathematicsNumber TheoryDiﬀerential EquationsSingle-variableApplications of DerivativesApplications of IntegralsMulti-variableDerivativesIntegralsRelated RatesGroup TheoryMatricesField TheoryPolynomial OperationsEquations and InequalitiesRing TheoryExponential FunctionsComplex NumbersLinear TransformationsVectorsAlgebraic ExpressionsLogarithmic FunctionsQuadratic FunctionsPrealgebraDeterminantsLie AlgebrasLimitsTrigonometric FunctionsFunctionsProbabilityStatisticsMath Word ProblemsTriangulationsManifolds3D ShapesAnglesPolygonsCurvatureAreaVolumeSurface AreaGeodesicsHyperbolic GeometryCombinatoricsLogicGraph TheoryAlgorithmsCongruencesPrime NumbersFactorizationGreatest Common Divisors (GCD)DivisibilityLeast Common Multiples (LCM)Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations (ODEs)Partial Diﬀerential Equations (PDEs)Figure 3: Hierarchical breakdown of covered mathe-matical topics in DeepMath-103K.Broad Topical DiversityA key characteris-tic of DeepMath-103K, alongside its high dif-ficulty, is its extensive topical diversity acrossthe mathematical landscape. We systemati-cally categorized each problem using a hierar-chical topic structure, following the method-ology established by Gao et al. (2024). Asillustrated in Figure 3, this classification re-veals that DeepMath-103K draws problemsfrom a multitude of core mathematical areas.The dataset’s scope ranges from fundamentaltopics such as Prealgebra and Plane Geom-etry to sophisticated domains like AbstractAlgebra (including Group Theory and FieldTheory) and advanced Calculus (covering Dif-ferential Equations and Applications of In-tegrals, among others). This broad topicalfoundation ensures that models trained onDeepMath-103K are exposed to a rich vari-ety of mathematical concepts and problem-solving paradigms, thereby fostering the de-velopment of more robust and widely gener-alizable reasoning skills.Contamination Rate0%20%40%60%80%100%Omni-MATHAIME83-24AIME24AMC23MathOdysseyGAOKAO (Math Cloze)MATH500GAOKAO (Math QA)MATHJEEBenchMinerva MathMMLU-STEMCMATHOlympiadBenchOlympicArenaGSM8KGPQA5.0%9.8%32.3%33.6%33.9%35.1%35.7%49.3%67.7%70.1%76.6%78.0%88.4%90.0%90.0%91.1%92.6%Figure 4: Contamination rates of common mathematical and STEM benchmarks detected in the rawdata sources before decontamination.Rigorous Data DecontaminationDeepMath-103K was constructed exclusively using the trainingsplits of existing open-source datasets, with careful avoidance of any known test set materials.However, our preliminary analysis revealed that these source datasets exhibit concerning levelsof contamination with problems from commonly used evaluation benchmarks. As illustrated inFigure 4, the contamination rates (defined as the percentage of benchmark test samples found withinthe raw data pool aggregated from source training splits) were notably high: reaching 90% forAIME24 and AMC23, 76.6% for MATH500, 35.7% for Minerva Math, and 33.6% for OlympiadBench.Recognizing that these benchmarks are frequently employed for model evaluation, DeepMath-103K underwent a rigorous decontamination procedure.

These solutionsoffer multiple valid approaches to the same question, allowing a model to learn diverseproblem-solving strategies. In contrast to datasets that present only a single correct path,the variety in DeepMath-103K’s solutions helps LLMs better generalize to unseen problems.• Model Distillation: Advanced teacher–student paradigms often rely on having multiplelabeled solution paths for individual questions. Through DeepMath-103K’s three solutiontrajectories, a larger teacher model can effectively impart varied problem-solving styles to asmaller student model, enhancing the student’s coverage of different reasoning heuristicsand strategies.• Rule-based Reinforcement Learning (e.g., RL-Zero): The availability of a verifiable final answerin each problem allows for straightforward reward assignment, as models can be directlyevaluated on whether their predicted result matches the correct solution. This binaryfeedback, essential for RL-based methods such as RL-Zero (Guo et al., 2025), fosters deeperreasoning by encouraging improvements specifically targeted at correctness.• Reward Modeling: With multiple valid solution paths, it becomes possible to design rewardmodels that differentiate between high- and low-quality reasoning steps or compare alterna-tive solution routes. This not only refines policy gradients in RL frameworks but also aidsin re-ranking or scoring candidate solutions in a multi-step decoding pipeline (xAI, 2025).Taken together, these features make DeepMath-103K exceptionally flexible for cutting-edge researchon AI-driven mathematical reasoning, supporting both direct RL with correctness-based rewardsand more nuanced learning frameworks that benefit from multiple, validated solution paths.3Construction of DeepMath-103KThis section details the meticulous data curation process used to construct DeepMath-103K, illus-trated in Figure 5.

While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress issignificantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challeng-ing, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contaminationwith evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems,specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is cu-rated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontaminationagainst numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9),significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes averifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutionssuitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Span-ning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the developmentof generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103Kachieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validatingits effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progressin building more capable AI reasoning systems.∗Equal Contribution. The work was done when Zhiwei, Xingyu, and Yue"

Gonzalez 1 21Letta2University of California, Berkeleyresearch@letta.comTest-time scaling has emerged as an effective way to boost LLM performance on challenging tasks byspending more time thinking on difficult problems (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2024; Snell et al., 2024;Brown et al., 2024). However, improved performance from test-time compute comes at a significant increasein latency and cost, waiting potentially several minutes for answers and costing up to tens of dollars perquery.1 These drawbacks are in part due to the fact that the current approach to applying test-time computeassumes that problems are stateless, i.e. queries (user queries at test-time) and the contexts (backgroundinformation) required for answering them are provided to the model together at “test-time.” In practice, thismeans that if multiple related queries require making similar inferences about the context at “test-time,” themodel will have to recompute redundant computations each time, incurring additional latency and cost.In reality, many LLM applications are inherently stateful, and work in conjunction with persisted, re-usedcontext. A classic example is document question-answering, where documents contextualize responses toquestions. Coding agents also operate on a large common repository and participate in multiple roundsof debugging support, while conversational assistants need to maintain the past dialogue. In all theseapplications, there is context (available documents, a codebase, or conversation history) that is alreadyavailable before the next user input.1https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-proarXiv:2504.13171v1 [cs.AI] 17 Apr 2025Apply computeat sleep-timeSleep-time compute reduces computetest-time A juggler can juggle 800 balls.

Out of these indigo tennis balls, 1/10 are marked, which gives us 10 marked indigo tennis balls (100 * 1/10).

Sleep-time computeprocesses the original raw context, adding additional computations that can potentially be useful for futurequeries. Moreover, contexts can be shared across related queries enabling savings in total cost per query.In these settings, we could in principle, make useful inferences about the current state (context) offlinebefore, or even during the user’s next input. We refer to such a process, as sleep-time compute: whereinference is done between interactions with the model while it would otherwise be idle in sleep-time. Inpractice, this is achieved by prompting the model to generate a new context consisting of inferences aboutthe existing context, which may be potentially useful for answering test-time queries. The re-representedcontext from sleep-time can then be provided in the prompt at test-time, enabling the model to respondto user queries at the accuracy of standard test-time compute but with far lower latencies. For example, acoding assistant at sleep-time may identify architectural patterns, anticipate potential debugging strategies,or infer optimizations prior to the user input. Moreover, users might ask multiple queries about the samecontext. In these settings, any inferences made during sleep-time can be shared across queries, effectivelyamortizing the cost of sleep-time compute and reducing the total average cost per query.To evaluate sleep-time compute, we modify two mathematical reasoning datasets to introduce two datasets– Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME – by splitting the existing problems in these datasets into acontext and a question. Using these datasets, we aim to empirically understand the benefits of sleep-timecompute on standard test-time compute benchmarks. We show that:• Sleep-time compute produces a pareto improvement in the test-time compute vs. accuracy curve,reducing the test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ∼5× on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME.2• By scaling up sleep-time compute, we see further pareto improvements, shifting the accuracy up by13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME.• By amortizing sleep-time compute across multiple queries for the same context, we can reduce theaverage cost per question by 2.5×.• We conduct analysis to understand which queries benefit the most from sleep-time compute, findingthat sleep-time compute is more effective in settings where the query is more easily predictable fromthe context.Finally, we end with case study of applying sleep-time compute to reduce test-time compute in a realisticagentic software engineering task.2Related WorkScaling test-time compute.Our work builds on recent progress on scaling up computation at test-timefor difficult reasoning problems (Snell et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2024; OpenAI, 2024). Two predominantapproaches to test-time scaling have emerged: sequential test-time scaling (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI,2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025; Snell et al., 2024) and parallel test-time scaling (Brown et al., 2024; Snell et al.,2024). While sequential test-time scaling has demonstrated impressive performance improvements, paralleltest-time scaling has the advantage of scaling test-time compute without increasing latency. In constrast, wepropose an alternative dimension where existing advancements in test-time compute, both sequential andparallel can be applied. Namely, instead of performing inference purely at test-time, we leverage computeon contexts that are available before the actual query arrives.Speculative decoding in LLMs.Speculative decoding is a standard technique for reducing latency indecoding with LLMs (Leviathan et al., 2023; Stern et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).Sleep-time compute similarly targets reducing reasoning latency by speculating on the user’s query as well asany potentially helpful reasoning over the context. However, unlike speculative decoding, the generatedtokens are used as an input regardless of the user’s actual query, and at test-time the reasoning model usesthese generated tokens to help answer the user query more efficiently.Pre-computation.Beyond LLMs, a long history of work has explored the trade-off between pre-computation and memory (eg. memory caches Smith (1982) and data cubes for OLAP workloads Grayet al. (1997)). Our work explores the same trade-off between query latency and pre-computation overhead,operating under the assumption that query workload patterns can be reasonably anticipated in advance.sleep-time compute builds on the idea of pre-fetching in traditional operating systems, in the context ofLLMs `a la Packer et al. (2023), storing frequently used computational results to avoid higher latency attest-time.3Sleep-time ComputeIn the standard paradigm of applying test-time compute, a user inputs a prompt p to the LLM and then theLLM applies test-time compute to help answer the user’s question. However, the p provided to the LLM canoftentimes be decomposed into a pre-existing context c (eg. a codebase) and a user query q (eg. a questionabout the codebase). When the LLM is not actively responding to the user, it typically still has access to theexisting context c. During this time, the LLM is typically idling, missing the opportunity to reason about coffline: a process we term sleep-time compute.3Test-time compute.In the test-time compute setting, the user provides q along with some context c andthe model outputs a reasoning trace followed by a final answer a. We denote this process, as: TB(q, c) →a,where T is the method for using test-time compute with budget B, which could include techniques likeextended chains of thought or best-of-N. In practice, the user may have multiple queries about the samecontext q1, q2 ... qN. In this setting, the model will carry out independent reasoning processes for eachqi, even if they are related to the same context c. Ideally, we would be able to reuse related inferencesacross each qi to save compute. Moreover, in many cases, c is complex and may require carrying outsignificant processing/inferences in order to provide an answer to q. Since, the test-time compute paradigmof T(q, c) →a assumes that c is only available at the same time as q, standard test-time compute carriesout all of these inferences only after the user provides the query, causing the user to wait up to severalminutes for a response. However, in practice we often have access to c before q and can carry out much ofthis processing ahead of time.Sleep-time compute.During sleep-time we are given the context c but not the query q. Using just thiscontext c, we can use the LLM to infer likely questions and reason about the context ultimately producinga more new re-represented context c′. We denote this process as: S(c) →c′, where S can be any standardtest-time scaling technique applied towards pre-processing the context at sleep-time. In this work, S(c)is implemented by prompting the model to draw inferences and re-write c in a way that might be usefulat test-time (see Appendix K for more details). After pre-processing the context, we can provide the newcontext c′ at test-time in place of c to produce a final answer to the user’s query: Tb(q, c′) →a. Since much ofthe reasoning about c has been done ahead of time in this case, we can use a much smaller test-time budgetb << B. Moreover, c′ can be shared across different queries qi about the same context, effectively amortizingthe compute required to arrive at c′ across queries, providing a total cost saving.4Experimental SetupNext, we describe the datasets, models, and baselines we use to evaluate sleep-time compute.4.1DatasetsWe select datasets which represent standard benchmarks for LLM reasoning and test-time scaling, and whichdemonstrate improvements from scaling test-time compute with state-of-the-art LLMs (either reasoning ornon-reasoning).Stateful datasets.We introduce two datasets to study applying sleep-time compute in stateful settings,Stateful GSM-Symbolic, and Stateful AIME, where each dataset is derived from splitting the existing datasetsinto a context and a question (see Figure 2 for an example). Stateful GSM-Symbolic is derived from the P1and P2 splits of GSM-Symbolic (Mirzadeh et al., 2024), which add one and two clauses respectively to theoriginal GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) to that increase the difficulty. GSM-Symbolic P1 contains 5000examples and P2 2500 examples. Stateful AIME contains 60 questions combined from AIME 2024 and 2025.In Appendix L and M, we show the breakdown of our results across AIME 2024 and 2025.Amortization dataset.To study the effect of related questions that share context, we introduce a newdataset Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, where each context has multiple queries. To generate multiple queriesfor a given context, we take Stateful GSM-Symbolic and use o3-mini to generate additional question answerpairs. We synthetically generate additional questions from existing context question pairs in GSM-Symbolic.Appendix C shows the prompt used to generate the additional questions. Figure 20 shows examples contexts4GSM-Symbolic (original)Stateful GSM-Symbolic (ours)A juggler can juggle 800 balls. 1/4 of the balls are tennis balls, and 1/2 of the tennis balls are indigo of which 1/10 are marked.

Therefore, on GSM-Symbolic,we conduct experiments using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, and on AIME, we conduct experiments usingOpenAI’s o1, o3-mini, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7 Extended Thinking , and Deepseek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI,2024). 2 3BaselinesThe main baseline we consider is the standard test-time compute setting in which both c andq are presented to the model for the first time at test-time. Furthermore, to validate that q is not triviallypredictable from c on our Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME datasets, we also compare to a context-only baseline in Appendix I, in which the model is only given c and is tasked with directly guessing ananswer to the question it guesses is most likely to come next.5Experiments and ResultsIn this section, we carry out experiments to understand the benefits of sleep-time compute. Specifically, wewould like to answer each of the following questions using the math reasoning benchmarks introducedabove:1.

We then study how applying sleep-time compute affects the pareto trade-off.Scaling test-time-compute sequentially.For non-reasoning models (GPT-4o and 4o-mini) on StatefulGSM-Symbolic, to vary the amount of test-time compute, we construct prompts that instruct the model touse different amounts of verbosity at test time,","Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) tosolve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute,which allows models to “think” offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating whatqueries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can significantly reduce the computerequirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of tworeasoning tasks – Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can reducethe amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ∼5× on Stateful GSM-Symbolicand Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% onStateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-timecompute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decreasethe average cost per query by 2.5×. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-timecompute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacyof sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agenticSWE task. Code and data released at: https"

Due to its con-cise architecture and impressive performance, CLIP has be-come the most widely used VLM across diverse researchtopics. For classification tasks, CLIP extracts features fromboth images and category descriptions, then chooses thecategory whose features exhibit the highest similarity tothe image’s feature representation. Beyond classification[48, 49, 61, 62], CLIP has been successfully applied to var-ious vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation [37, 60],object detection [56, 59], and image clustering [3, 22].The impressive performance on downstream tasks andthe broad range of applications of CLIP not only highlightits powerful capabilities but also expose it to potential vul-arXiv:2504.11195v1 [cs.LG] 15 Apr 2025nerabilities, particularly under adversarial attacks [19, 26].While adversarial attacks and defenses [13, 24, 55] havebeen widely explored for conventional visual models, thesituation for CLIP is more complex. The pre-training ofCLIP requires the collection of vast amounts of image-textpairs and substantial computational resources that most de-ployers cannot afford. As a result, many deployers chooseto adopt open-source versions of CLIP from a small rangeof candidates. This fact introduces a relatively high risk ofadversarial attacks targeting CLIP-based applications.Recent works [21, 26] explore adversarial prompt tun-ing using annotated data to enhance the robustness of CLIP.However, their reliance on labeled data and limited flexibil-ity across tasks pose challenges for real-world deployment.To address this, we choose to defend adversarial attacks inthe inference stage, which is applicable across various sce-narios and requires no labeled dataset or prior knowledge ofthe downstream task, as shown in Figure 1. Existing test-time adaptation methods [38, 54] primarily focus on im-proving accuracy for clean test samples, while overlookingthe potential risks posed by adversarial attacks. Moreover,deploying defense at test time necessitates short inferencetime and avoiding using additional resources, such as largelanguage models or diffusion models, to ensure versatility.To address the above challenges and achieve successfuldefense against potential attacks, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT). First, we revisit and refinethe widely used optimization objective for instance adapta-tion. Many previous works [38, 42], following MEMO [58],augment the test instance and aim to minimize marginalentropy, which is defined as the entropy of the mean pre-diction. We decompose marginal entropy into two compo-nents: a pointwise entropy term and the Kullback–Leibler(KL) divergence, which measures the divergence betweenpredictions from each augmented view and the mean pre-diction. We observe that when adapting to adversarial ex-amples with high-confidence inaccurate predictions, the KLdivergence term tends to pull the augmented views towardthe misleading mean prediction, which does not exist inthe clean scenario. This meaningless operation introducesconflicts into the optimization process. To mitigate the in-fluence of adversarial samples and preserve simplicity, wediscard the KL divergence term, retaining only the point-wise entropy minimization for tuning textual prompts. Thisstraightforward modification not only defends against ad-versarial attacks but also maintains clean performance.In order to effectively leverage knowledge from aug-mented views, we propose a reliability-based weighted en-sembling strategy. To assign a larger weight to reliable aug-mented views during ensembling, we introduce a similarity-based metric to assess the reliability of samples. We hy-pothesize that samples with higher similarity to their neigh-bors are farther away from outliers and contain more reli-able information. Thus, we calculate the average similarityof each sample with its neighbors to estimate its reliabil-ity. Using this metric, outliers such as adversarial examplesand noisy augmented views are assigned lower reliabilityscores, which means less participation in the ensembling.Finally, we obtain the final prediction by ensembling theindividual model predictions, weighted according to theirreliability. Extensive experiments on fine-grained classifi-cation benchmarks and distribution shift benchmarks vali-date the effectiveness of our method in both adaptation anddefense against adversarial attacks. Our contributions aresummarized as follows:• We propose R-TPT, which is the first to explore test-timeparadigms for defending against potential adversarial at-tacks in CLIP.• We discard the KL divergence term from the marginalentropy objective to eliminate optimization conflicts andpropose a reliability-based weighted ensembling strategyto integrate knowledge from reliable augmented views.• Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness ofour method in both adaptation and adversarial defense.2. Related Work2.1. Adversarial Attack and DefenseA lot of research [13, 24, 43] has been devoted to study-ing neural network’s vulnerability to adversarial noise. Apioneering work [43] introduces the concept of adversar-ial examples and finds small-amplitude noise that humanscannot recognize leads to misclassifications. Since then,a series of attack methods to generate adversarial samples[4, 8, 13, 24] have been proposed. FGSM [13] proposes toutilize the gradient sign to generate an adversarial example.Researchers [24] generate the adversarial noise by projectedgradient descent (PGD) operation, which becomes the stan-dard measurement of model robustness. Moreover, a varietyof works explore adversarial attacks in many restricted con-ditions, ranging from one-pixel attack [41], universal per-turbation [28] to more realistic black-box setting [2, 18].In parallel, numerous defense strategies [24, 36, 50, 55]have been proposed to mitigate adversarial attacks. Adver-sarial training [13, 24] improves the robustness of the modelby incorporating the adversarial samples into the trainingset. TRADES [55] provides a theoretical analysis of adver-sarial error to trade adversarial robustness against accuracy.AWP [50] perturbs the model’s weights with small adver-sarial noise during training to enhance robustness. Recon-struction [29, 34] with generative models [12, 39] is also acommonly used technique in test-time defense methods.As for the vison-language models, TeCoA [26] and APT[21] employ adversarial training to pretrained CLIP [32] toimprove the adversarial robustness.

To effectively utilizethe knowledge of the augmented views, R-TPT applies a reliability-based weighted ensembling mechanism in the final inference process.bility across tasks. In this work, we choose to deploy adver-sarial defense in the test time that is more effective and flex-ible and can collaborate with their training-time defense.2.2. Test-Time Adaptation for VLMsTest-time adaptation [23, 38, 52] aims to adapt pre-trainedmodels to the test data at inference time to improve theperformance further. According to the test data form, test-time adaptation is divided into streaming data adaptation[44, 46, 53] and single instance adaptation [38, 58], and ourwork focuses on the latter. Recent research [38, 42, 54] hasbeen devoted to exploring the instance adaptation methodsfor VLMs [32, 47, 57]. TPT [38] employs the marginalentropy minimization to augmentation views of the test in-stance to correct the prediction. DiffTPT [11] utilizes thediffusion technique to obtain diverse views which is help-ful for the adaptation. PromptAlign [1] aligns the statisticsof the test instance and collected natural images to make themodel’s parameters adapt to test samples. To take advantageof more prompt templates [32], TPS [42] chooses to opti-mize feature shift and utilizes prompt ensembling for ini-tialization. Moreover, researchers [54] propose a training-free adaptation method by ensembling the augmented viewswith the MeanShift algorithm [7].Besides accuracy, researchers [51] also focus on improv-ing calibration performance through higher text feature dis-persion. In this work, we first utilize the test-time paradigmto defend against adversarial attacks for CLIP due to its se-vere vulnerability to adversarial examples.3. MethodologyIn this paper, we improve CLIP’s adversarial robustnessthrough a test-time paradigm, motivated by its inherent vul-nerabilities and the high resource demands of train-time de-fense methods. Our proposed robust test-time prompt tun-ing (R-TPT), as illustrated in Figure 2, requires no anno-tated data and is equipped with greater flexibility. In Sec.3.1, we begin with reviewing the foundational concepts ofCLIP and the test-time prompt tuning approach. We thenintroduce the two key components of R-TPT: pointwise en-tropy minimization in Sec. 3.2, and the reliability-basedweighted ensembling strategy in Sec. 3.3.3.1. PreliminaryContrastive language-image pre-training. CLIP is a pop-ular language-vision model with a double-tower architec-ture, consisting of an image encoder F(·) and a text en-coder G(·). It is pretrained by the contrastive learning ob-jective with a large amount of image-text pairs. Benefitingfrom rich pretraining knowledge, CLIP has a strong zero-shot generalization ability. Take a C-way classification taskwith class names {tc}Cc=1 as an example, CLIP obtains tex-tual features gc by the text encoder G(·) with a prompt tem-plate (e.g., “a photo of a []”) and the class name tc as theinput. Also, each test image xi queries the image encoderto calculate the image feature fi = F(xi). The probabil-ity that xi belongs to category c is calculated by a softmaxoperation with the cosine similarity of those features:pc(xi) =exp(cos(fi, gc)/τ)PCj=1 exp(cos(fi, gj)/τ),(1)where cos(·) represents the cosine similarity operation andτ refers to the temperature default set to 0.01.Test-time prompt tuning.Although CLIP exhibitsstrong classification performance, it is sensitive to distri-bution shifts. To address this issue, test-time prompt tun-ing (TPT) [38] improves the model’s performance on indi-vidual test instances, without requiring additional trainingdata for adaptation. During the test time, TPT deploys aug-mentation operations on the test instance x0 to obtain aug-mented views {xi}Ni=1 and tunes the textual prompts withlow-entropy views. The core objective of TPT is to mini-mize marginal entropy, which is formulated as:Lmarginal = H(¯p) = H( 1| B |Xx∈Bp(x)),(2)where H(·) is the Shannon entropy and B represents thesample set selected from all views {xi}Ni=0 based on thelow entropy. When augmentation provides valuable infor-mation, the classification boundary adapts according to thenew prompt, leading to more accurate predictions.3.2. Refining Marginal Entropy MinimizationIn the optimization of a single test sample, marginal entropyis the default choice for both visual models [58] and multi-modal models [38]. Minimizing marginal entropy H(¯p) en-courages the model to produce a consistent output across aset of selected low-entropy augmented views B. However,when the test sample is adversarially perturbed, it can easilybe selected into the set B. While random augmentations canweaken the adversarial noise, enforcing consistency acrossall augmented outputs may mislead the optimization. Sinceour goal is to utilize test time adaptation to strengthen themodel’s defense ability to adversarial examples, we proposerefining the marginal entropy objective.We decompose the marginal entropy objective into twoitems as follows:H(¯p) = −CXc=1¯pc log¯pc = −1|B||B|Xb=1CXc=1pbc log¯pc= 1|B||B|Xb=1−CXc=1pbc logpbc +CXc=1pbc log pbc¯pc!= 1|B||B|Xb=1","Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gainedsignificant popularity as foundation models, with numerousfine-tuning methods developed to enhance performance ondownstream tasks. However, due to their inherent vulner-ability and the common practice of selecting from a lim-ited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higherrisk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision mod-els. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adver-sarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeleddata and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To ad-dress these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompttuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversar-ial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate"

ReproducibilityTo ensure reproducibility, the versions of datasets and models from HuggingFace were fixed, ensuringthat the results could be reproduced. The source code and detailed instructions for running theexperiments can be found in our GitHub repository14.For the baseline models, various models including MultPAX [15], PyATE [24], RAKE [30] wereemployed, alongside several models using the PKE library [25], including FirstPhrases, KPMiner, Kea,MultipartiteRank, PositionRank, SingleRank, TextRank, TfIdf, TopicRank, and YAKE. The use of theselibraries ensured that all model versions were fixed, facilitating precise replication of our results.5. ConclusionIn this paper, an approach for concept extraction from abstract documents using pre-trained largelanguage models (LLMs) was presented. Our method addresses the challenging task of extractingall present concepts related to a specific domain, rather than just the keyphrases summarizing theimportant information discussed in a document. Comprehensive evaluations of two widely usedbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art models. Ouremphasis on reproducibility has ensured that the findings have been reliably replicated across variousmodels. One limitation of this work is its reliance on exact lexical matching to filter concepts fromthe generated output. While this approach ensures that only terms present in the input document areretained, it fails to account for situations where an LLM generates semantically accurate concepts thatdo not have an exact match in the text. As a result, relevant concepts that capture the meaning aregoing to be discarded, negatively affecting recall and the overall evaluation.In the future, we plan to create datasets annotated by domain experts in the field of Materials Scienceand Engineering (MSE). This will allow us to further test and refine our ConExion models, ensuringthey are robust and effective across a broader range of scientific domains. We also want to explore moremethods on how to restrict the LLM models to only produce specific tokens (those that appear in the14https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/concept_extractiondocument). Additionally, we are interested in investigating the effects of continued pre-training andtask-specific instruction tuning of LLMs on concept extraction performance. This could provide furtherinsights into how domain adaptation influence model behavior on this task.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for financial supportof the project Innovation-Platform MaterialDigital through project funding FKZ no: 13XP5094F (FIZ).MatWerk funding acknowledgement This publication was written by the NFDI consortium NFDI-MatWerk in the context of the work of the association German National Research Data Infrastructure(NFDI) e.V..

Under review.Estimating Optimal Context Length for Hybrid Retrieval-augmented Multi-document SummarizationAdithya PratapaTeruko MitamuraLanguage Technologies InstituteCarnegie Mellon University{vpratapa, teruko}@cs.cmu.eduretriever, summarizer, and dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of thedataset, we use a panel of LLMs to generate a pool of silver references. Weuse these silver references to estimate the optimal context length for a givenRAG system configuration. Our results on the multi-document summariza-tion task showcase the effectiveness of our method across model classesand sizes. We compare against length estimates from strong long-contextbenchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also highlights theeffectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs and itsgeneralization to new classes of LMs.11IntroductionLanguage models increasingly support longer context windows, leading to useful appli-cations in large-scale multi-document summarization. Recent work has shown that thesemodels are not very effective at their claimed context windows (Hsieh et al., 2024; Yenet al., 2025). An alternative to the full context setting is retrieval-augmented generation(RAG), and previous work has illustrated its effectiveness for long input processing (Asaiet al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). RAG systems facilitate better use of the LM context windows bypassing only the most relevant information to the model. However, the choice of retrievallength that provides peak RAG performance is often unclear and sensitive to the choice ofretriever, language model, and downstream task (Jin et al., 2025). In this work, we presenta methodology for estimating this optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever,summarizer, and dataset. In addition to providing gains over the full context setting, ourmethod also outperforms the context-length estimates identified by standard long-contextevaluation benchmarks. Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of our method.Previous efforts to combine RAG and long-context LMs focused on query-based routing(Li et al., 2024), or iterative RAG (Yue et al., 2025). While these methods are effective, theyrely on the model’s ability to accurately determine the scope of information need and self-evaluate its own output. This might not always be a feasible option, especially for smallerLMs. In this work, we take a complementary approach to combine RAG and long-contextand show its effectiveness for models ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters. We evaluate ona challenging large-scale multi-document summarization dataset (Laban et al., 2024).1Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/adithya7/hybrid-rag.1arXiv:2504.12972v1 [cs.CL] 17 Apr 2025Preprint. Under review.Figure 1: A schematic overview of our proposed method. Unlike traditional benchmarks,we estimate the optimal retrieval length as a function of dataset, retriever and summarizer.Given a dataset, we first sample a fraction of examples. On this subset, we run a panelof LLMs in a full-context setup to create silver candidates. We then identify the top silvercandidates using Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. With the help of these silver candidates,we estimate the optimal retrieval length for the given experiment config.In a recent work, Jin et al. (2025) compared the RAG performance of varying model sizes onthe question-answering task and found that the optimal retrieval length varies considerablyacross model sizes. They also found that this length is sensitive to the choice of retriever.Similarly, Yu et al. (2024) noted the sensitivity of optimal retrieval length to the downstreamtask. Based on these observations from previous work, we hypothesize that the retrievallength that provides peak performance should be modeled as a function of the three maincomponents of the RAG pipeline: retriever, summarizer, and dataset. For our baselines,we use two popular long-context evaluation benchmarks, RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) andHELMET (Yen et al., 2025). They benchmark models on a suite of tasks with inputs ofincreasing lengths. RULER focuses on synthetic retrieval tasks, while HELMET includesNLP tasks such as LongQA and summarization. Although these provide effective contextlength estimates for individual LMs, these estimates are often agnostic to the downstreamdataset and the retrievers when used in the RAG setting.Given a dataset, we first create a subset of representative examples by random sampling.We then use a panel of LLMs to compile a candidate set of silver reference summaries. Inour panel, we include LMs from the Qwen (Qwen et al., 2025), Llama (Grattafiori et al., 2024)and Jamba (Team et al., 2024) series. From the pool of candidate silver references, we useMinimum Bayes Risk decoding (Kumar & Byrne, 2004) to identify the top silver referencesummaries. For a given combination of retriever and summarizer models, we perform asearch over context lengths on this silver subset to estimate the optimal retrieval length.Unlike baseline methods, our approach is customized to the specific experiment configura-tion (dataset, retriever, and summarizer). Our method is based on two key observations.First, larger LMs show robust performance across a broad range of context lengths. Thisis mainly due to their enhanced ability to deal with noise in the retrieved input (Jin et al.,2025). Second, to identify a task-specific estimate, we can approximate the gold summarieswith silver candidates sampled from strong long-context LMs.We evaluated our method for the multi-document summarization task using the SummHaydataset (Laban et al., 2024). Our results show that all retrieval-based methods (baselines andours) significantly outperform full-context. Our method performs the best in most settings,followed by HELMET- and RULER-based estimates. Although HELMET-based estimatessometimes perform comparable to our method, neither the LongQA nor summarizationtask-based HELMET estimates consistently perform better. Notably, our method performsmuch better on very long-context LMs such as Qwen 2.5 1M and ProLong 512k. Our analysis2Preprint. Under review.also shows that our method generalizes well to model classes outside of our panel (e.g.,Phi-3). We also perform ablation experiments on our LM panel as well as the size of oursampled subset.2Estimating Optimal Context Length for RetrievalFor the multi-document summarization task, given a long input and a query, we have twopossible systems. First, the entire input is fed directly into a long-context summarizer thatsupports such lengths (full-context). Second, we use the query to rank the documents andonly pass the top-k relevant documents to the summarizer (RAG). Previous work has shownthat long-context models are not effective at their claimed context windows, and RAG canhelp improve task performance (Yu et al., 2024; Pratapa & Mitamura, 2025).Benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET provide a comprehensive evaluation of long-context models across a suite of NLP tasks, including QA and summarization. However,these benchmarks focus solely on the model and do not study the effects of unseen down-stream datasets and the retrievers used in RAG settings. Jin et al. (2025) observed significantvariance in RAG performance depending on the choice of LM and retriever. Yu et al. (2024)noted similar behavior for question-answering tasks. Therefore, we hypothesize that theoptimal context length estimate for RAG settings should be a function of the retriever, sum-marizer, and specific downstream task. Before describing our approach, we first provide anoverview of our baselines.2.1BaselinesFull-context: We use the full context window as supported by the summarization model.Typically, larger models also tend to perform well in long-context tasks. To study thisbehavior, we include models of varying sizes in our experiments. Inputs longer than thesupported context window are truncated starting with the longest documents.RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) benchmark consists of a collection of synthetic retrieval tasksat varying input lengths (8K, 16K, 32K, 64K and 128K). For a given LM, this benchmarkevaluates its retrieval performance at these input lengths and determines an effective contextwindow by using the performance of Llama-2-7B @ 4k as a threshold. We used the effectivecontext windows reported in previous work as our baseline estimates.HELMET (Yen et al., 2025) benchmark covers a suite of NLP tasks, with multiple datasetsincluded in each task. The tasks are recall, RAG, citation, re-ranking, ICL, LongQA, andsummarization. For each dataset, they evaluate system performance at varying inputlengths (same set as RULER). They report task averages, as well as a HELMET average. Asour baseline, we select the two most relevant subtasks, LongQA and summarization. Foreach task, we choose the context length with the highest task average.Note that both RULER and HELMET benchmarks evaluate model in a full-context settingbut often find the optimal context window to be much lower than the claimed (or supported)context window by the model. In our experiments, we used previously reported scores onthe RULER and HELMET benchmarks. See Table 7 in Appendix §A.1 for a full list of ourbaseline context length estimates.2.2Proposed: Estimate context length with a silver LLM panelAs we highlighted earlier, the baseline estimates do not factor in the effects of retriever anddownstream dataset. Our proposed method is centered on two key observations. First,large LMs show robust performance across a broad range of context lengths because oftheir enhanced ability to deal with noise in the retrieved input. Jin et al. (2025) studiedthis for long input QA tasks. Second, identifying optimal context length requires access tothe gold labels, but these could be approximated by silver references sampled from stronglong-context LMs.3Preprint. Under review.Based on these observations, we use a panel of LMs to create silver labels (summaries) for agiven dataset. We work with a random sample of the dataset, as this helps to integrate thetask-specific behavior of our RAG system. We then run the RAG system on the sampledsilver dataset to identify the optimal context length. We describe our individual componentsof our system below.2.2.1LLM panelIn our LLM panel, we include a diverse class of models. Panels of diverse LLMs havepreviously been explored for evaluation and are considered a strong alternative to a singleLM evaluator (Verga et al., 2024).Large LMs: We choose Qwen-2.5 72B (Qwen et al., 2025), Llama-3.3 70B (Grattafiori et al.,2024), and Jamba-1.5 Mini (Team et al., 2024). These are the largest models from each classthat we could run locally.2Long-context LMs: We include two smaller LMs that are specifically trained for long-contexttasks, Qwen-2.5-1M 14B (Yang et al., 2025) and ProLong 512K (Gao et al., 2024). ProLong iscontinually trained on long texts starting from the Llama-3 8B model.In our pool, we focussed on including diverse models while being within our computebudget to run these models locally. Our panel can be easily modified with newer variants ofthese models as well as include API-based models.2.2.2Pool of silver referencesSubsample dataset: We randomly sample a fraction of the examples (25%) from the datasetand run our LLM panel to create a pool of silver reference summaries. We do not use goldsummaries during this process. For each system in our LLM panel, we use temperaturesampling (τ = 0.5) to generate three candidate summaries. Here, we experiment with twoways to create our final candidate set, pooling from a single LM or multiple LMs.Single LM: We compile our silver references using only the three candidates sampled froma single system in our LLM panel (e.g., Qwen-2.5 72B).Multiple LMs: We first pool all candidates from all systems into a large set of candidates. Wethen use Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to identify the three top scoring candidates.We follow previous work (Suzgun et al., 2023; Bertsch et al., 2023) to compute the similaritybetween each pair of candidates and obtain the alignment scores among the candidates. Tobe consistent with our downstream summarization task, we use the A3CU F1 score as ourMBR utility metric.Our use of MBR decoding here borrows ideas from previous summarization works, specifi-cally post-ensemble (Kobayashi, 2018) and crowd sampling (Suzgun et al., 2023). Similarlyto Kobayashi (2018), we use a model ensemble in the post-processing stage. We followSuzgun et al. (2023) to use temperature sampling and a neural utility metric. However, ourutility metric differs from the BLEURT and BERTScore used in Suzgun et al. (2023).2.2.3Retrieval context length searchGiven our sampled silver dataset, we now identify the optimal retrieval context length bysearching a wide spectrum of lengths from 8 to 80K in 8K intervals. This differs from thecoarser context lengths used in the RULER and HELMET benchmarks. For each contextlength, we run the summarizer on the sampled dataset. We generate three predictions perinput using temperature sampling (τ = 0.5). We then evaluate the system-generated sum-maries against our silver reference pool to identify the optimal context length. For efficiencyreasons, we choose the smallest context length that falls within a standard deviation of themaximum score.Yue et al. (2025) is closely related to our work. For the question-answering task, theypropose an iterative long-context RAG method that uses inference-time scaling to improve2We couldn’t run Llama 405B and Jamba 1.5 Large (400B) locally on our setup.4Preprint. Under review.task performance. Unlike a traditional RAG setup, they iteratively generate subqueriesand retrieve additional documents before generating the final answer. They present acomputation allocation model that optimizes task performance based on three parameters:number of documents, number of demonstrations, and maximum number of iterations. Oursetting differs considerably from this work. For multi-document summarization task, wehave a fixed set of documents, and including demonstrations in the prompt is often infeasible.However, we believe that iterative methods could still be useful for the summarization task,and we leave this extension to future work.3Experimental SetupIn this section, we describe our dataset, the evaluation metric, and the systems used forretrieval and summarization tasks.3.1Dataset & MetricSummHay: Proposed by Laban et al. (2024), this is a multi-document summarizationcurated using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, starting with summary insights followed by documentgeneration. Each input typically consists of 100 documents (avg. length 884 words), and thesummary consists of an average of 185 words. This dataset includes 92 examples that coverthe news and conversational domains.Metric: For the summarization task, we report the F1 score of the reference-based AtomicContent Unit (A3CU) metric (Liu et al., 2023b). This model-based metric is trained to predicta score that measures the overlap of atomic content units (Liu et al., 2023a) between thesystem-generated and reference summaries.

In this paper, we introduce anovel approach for graded entity salience thatcombines the strengths of both approaches.Using an English dataset spanning 12 spokenand written genres, we collect 5 summaries perdocument and calculate each entity’s saliencescore based on its presence across these sum-maries.Our approach shows stronger cor-relation with scores based on human sum-maries and alignments, and outperforms ex-isting techniques, including LLMs.We re-lease our data and code at https://github.com/jl908069/gum_sum_salience1 to sup-port further research on graded salient entityextraction.1IntroductionSalient entity extraction (SEE) is the task of iden-tifying the most central entities mentioned in anarbitrary document in a given language, basedon their contribution to the overall meaning ofthe document (Gamon et al., 2013). SEE has arange of applications, for example in news searchand analysis, as well as summarization (Asgariehet al., 2024), since users may want to categorizearticles based on mentioned salient (but not non-salient) entities, or ensure that summary informa-1Data is also available from https://github.com/amir-zeldes/gum.tion focuses on salient, rather than tangential enti-ties.Two key challenges inherent in work on SEEare the gradualness and subjectivity involved inhuman salience judgments.For example, in abiography of Albert Einstein, Einstein is likelyto be the most salient person, but other peoplementioned can still be more salient, e.g. Danishphysicist Niels Bohr, with whom Einstein enteredinto prominent debates, or less so, e.g. Einstein’suncle Jakob – both are mentioned in Einstein’sWikipedia article, the latter only briefly but theformer 11 times. Although human raters are likelyto easily agree that Bohr is more salient in Ein-stein’s Wikipedia page than Jakob Einstein, thereare many subtle cases on which they disagree: Do-jchinovski et al. (2016) showed that crowdsourcedentity salience annotations contained nearly 20%of labels that had to be discarded as ‘untrustwor-thy’, and achieved only around 63% agreement.Other approaches opt to exploit additional prop-erties of documents for a more operationalizabledefinition of salience, for example based on hy-perlinks in the document (Wu et al., 2020) or themention of entities in a summary of the document(Dunietz and Gillick, 2014; Lin and Zeldes, 2024).While these approaches reach much higher agree-ment (over 97% in Lin and Zeldes 2024), they arelimited to single, binary judgments (an entity ei-ther appears in a summary or not, is either hy-perlinked or not, etc.) and are more sensitive tovariability in the underlying properties (many doc-uments contain no links, a link may or may notbe added, the summary could have been different,etc.).In this paper, we aim to combine the bene-fits of clearly operationalized approaches to entitysalience, specifically in the paradigm of summary-based salience, with the advantages of gradedsalience labels derived from multiple aggregatedsources. Our approach relies on collecting mul-tiple, separate summaries of each document, andaligning mentions to the original text to createnumerical salience scores based on the numberof summaries mentioning each entity (e.g. 5/5summaries would mention Einstein in his biog-raphy, some might mention Bohr, and probablynone would mention his uncle).To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first attempt tocast summarization-based salience as a regression,rather than a classification problem.The main contributions of this paper are:• A novel approach to graded summary-basedentity salience prediction, demonstrating anearly 17-point improvement in F1 score andbetter correlation with human summary andalignment-based salience scores compared toleading LLMs• A new dataset based on the openly availableUD English GUM corpus (Zeldes, 2017),semi-automatically enriched with 5 alignedsummaries and graded salience scores for allnamed and non-named entities• A thorough evaluation of models and systemsused to create our data, including fully man-ually constructed test and dev sets• Analysis of error patterns in models’ entitysalience predictions and their correlation withhuman annotated salience2Related WorkThe increasing importance of SEE is reflected inthe expanding number of annotated datasets, em-ploying different strategies for entity recognitionand salience labeling (see Table 1).However,building a reliable dataset with consistent entitysalience annotations remains a significant chal-lenge for a number of reasons, including lack ofreliable and exhaustive entity annotations, the ab-sence of consistent guidelines for entity salience,subjectivity in the assignment of salience scores,and limited data availability across text genres,with previous work focusing almost only on newsand Wikipedia material.To ensure the reliability of an entity saliencedataset, the first step is to adopt a robust methodfor identifying entities within a document. Somework (Dunietz and Gillick, 2014; Gamon et al.,2013) has utilized multi-step automatic pipelines(including NP extraction, coreference resolution,and a named entity recognizer) to identify enti-ties, while others (Dojchinovski et al., 2016; Traniet al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020) have undertaken man-ual annotation. The latter is potentially more accu-rate but expensive, while NLP pipelines are cheapbut may propagate errors to later steps. Further-more, salient entities in a document are not nec-essarily named entities, but also non-named ones.Most previous datasets (Bullough et al., 2024; Do-jchinovski et al., 2016; Dunietz and Gillick, 2014;Gamon et al., 2013; Maddela et al., 2022; Traniet al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020) include only namedentities, leaving out common noun entities thatmay be salient to humans – in fact, some docu-ments contain no named entities, but we wouldstill assume some of the non-named entities willbe more salient than others.The second challenge in building a reliable en-tity salience dataset is how to minimize noise insalience labels and apply consistent guidelines.Entity salience labels have been derived eitherthrough crowdsourcing, gathering ratings frommultiple non-expert raters to determine salient en-tities (Bullough et al., 2024; Dojchinovski et al.,2016; Maddela et al., 2022; Trani et al., 2018),or by employing proxy methods such as abstractsor writer-assigned Wikinews categories (Gamonet al., 2013; Dunietz and Gillick, 2014; Wu et al.,2020).While crowdsourcing can surpass auto-mated methods in performance, it is inherentlynoisy and prone to bias, as opinions on whatis salient can be unpredictable (Maddela et al.,2022).On the other hand, using proxies hasbeen shown to be less noisy (i.e. more repro-ducible), but can suffer from a lack of reliabilityin the proxies themselves. For example, the NYT(New York Times)-salience dataset (Dunietz andGillick, 2014) relied on found news abstracts toidentify salient entities. This approach has severallimitations: First, the derived salience labels maybe less reliable due to the lack of clear and consis-tent guidelines for summaries (e.g. length, style).Second, relying on news article abstracts restrictsthe dataset to certain types of genres (i.e. news).In this study, we adopt a regimented approachsimilar to the NYT salience corpus (Dunietz andGillick 2014), which identifies salient entities us-ing summaries. To improve annotation reliabil-ity, we crowdsourced summaries across 12 En-glish genres, following very specific guidelinesproposed by Liu and Zeldes (2023a).

Additionally, it al-lows us to obtain graded salience judgments with-out sacrificing this reliability.3DatasetOur dataset, called GUM-SAGE (GUM-basedSummary Aligned Graded Entities) is based onthe GUM corpus (Zeldes, 2017), an open-accessmanually annotated, multilayer resource for En-glish. The corpus spans over 200K tokens across12 different text genres (see Table 2), and includesUniversal Dependencies (UD) parses (de Marn-effe et al., 2021), detailed entity annotations suchas entity types and Wikification links (Lin andZeldes, 2021), coreference resolution (Zhu et al.,2021), and discourse parses (Liu and Zeldes,2023b).Additionally, the dataset provides anexpert-written summary for each document (Liuand Zeldes 2023a), aligned to the entity annota-tions for entities mentioned in the summary (Linand Zeldes, 2024), which we leverage for evalua-tion below.In this paper we add entity salience scores (0-5) for all named and non-named entities in thedata using an SEE pipeline with two components:Summary Crowdsourcing & Generation (Section3.1) and Entity Alignment (Section 3.2). We as-sume that it is difficult to summarize a text with-out mentioning its most salient entities, and thatsalient entities will therefore tend to appear insummaries, while spuriously mentioned entitieswill not recur in many summaries.The SEEpipeline therefore collects multiple summaries perdocument, aligning mentions to assign saliencescores based on the number of summaries men-tioning the entity. We evaluate the accuracy of ourapproach in Section 4.3.1Summary Crowdsourcing & GenerationEach document in GUM is already accompaniedby a single expert-written summary, and an ad-ditional second human-written summary is pro-vided for each of the 24 test documents (Liu andZeldes, 2023a). However because our approachto salience is based heavily on summary content,which can vary, a single summary may be inad-equate to identify salient entities within a docu-ment, by either missing some salient entities, orcontaining spurious ones.We therefore crowd-source or generate summaries for our data:SummaryCrowdsourcingInthesummarycrowdsourcing task, each annotator is asked toread eight documents from different genres be-fore writing a one-sentence summary for the doc-ument, which should ‘substitute reading the text’,focus on ‘who did what to whom’, and, spaceallowing, ‘when, where and how’, but may notexceed 380 characters, following Liu and Zeldes(2023a). Annotators were also instructed not tomention anything not mentioned in the document,and to adhere as closely as possible to the docu-ments vocabulary and phrasing. All of the crowd-sourced summaries were manually checked by oneof the authors to ensure that they follow the guide-lines.Most of the summaries did so, though asmall portion deviated in two key areas: (i) Men-tioning facts not mentioned in the text, such asspeaker names not explicitly stated but identifi-able from context; (ii) Using shell nouns like “thisreddit post”, which should generally be avoided ifthey are not unambiguously identifiable in the text(e.g. a writer states this is a reddit post). Any sum-maries that did not comply with guidelines wereminimally manually corrected to maintain consis-tency, without otherwise altering their meaning.Summary GenerationWe select four recentLLMs – GPT-4o(OpenAI,2024), Claude3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024), Llama 3.2 3BacademicbioconversationfictioninterviewnewsredditspeechtextbookvlogvoyagewikihowTOTALDocuments182014191923181515151819213Tokens17,90518,55414,30718,00316,50421,76717,98613,19514,45114,78417,98418,341203,781Mentions5,0455,7684,0944,9745,2114,7204,5444,8474,7194,4994,4714,46857,360Entities3,2513,3241,3632,3522,6422,5792,3642,5732,8851,6262,9572,38432,300Avg # of Entities18116697124139112131172192108164125148% Salient Entities6.39.19.48.09.611.612.214.415.816.819.432.913.8% of Top1 Salient Entities0.91.23.21.52.02.31.52.11.82.42.53.62.1% of Top3 Salient Entities1.92.86.63.53.74.64.74.64.96.55.19.94.9Table 2: Overview of GUM-SAGE.

The latter are systems that evolve in time according to some rules,namely ordinary or partial differential equations, that are commonly derivedfrom first principles [2]. The resulting equation-based models provide a rigor-ous mathematical representation of the system behavior, and their solution isusually approximated via conventional numerical methods, including spectral,finite difference, finite element and spectral element methods (see e.g., [3–7]).This equation-based approach has proven extremely successful, yielding accu-rate and actionable solutions across different disciplines, including weather andclimate science [8] and engineering [9], among many others.The emergence of machine learning (ML) has led to a paradigm shift inforecasting, with researchers and practitioners increasingly leveraging thesedata-driven methods as alternatives to traditional equation-based models.Unlike traditional approaches that explicitly leverage physical laws (i.e., ourknowledge about the system) in the form of ordinary or partial differentialequations, ML models learn complex patterns directly from data; this oftenwithout explicitly enforcing the underlying governing equations. ML modelshave demonstrated the ability to achieve accurate predictions for both canoni-cal dynamical systems [10] and real-world applications, such as weather [11–14]and climate [15–17].Despite significant progress, several key challenges remain. In particu-lar, ML models – including neural networks – often struggle to accuratelycapture fine-scale structures in long-term predictions [18]. Additionally, theycan exhibit instability or unphysical behavior, limiting their reliability inapplications where high-fidelity is paramount.More fundamentally, ML models often function as black boxes, makingit difficult to assess whether they adhere to established physical principlesencoded in equation-based models (e.g., [19, 20]). To address these limita-tions, various promising strategies have emerged, including physics-informedML approaches [21], which weakly embed partial differential equations (PDEs)into the model, and explicit physical constraints that enforce the conservationof key physical quantities [17].However, little to no attention has been given to evaluating the physicaland/or dynamical fidelity of ML forecasts, other than looking at traditionalerror metrics such as mean squared error, and its variants [22, 23].In this work, we propose error metrics that directly evaluate the physi-cal fidelity of ML forecasts from a dynamical perspective. The proposed errormetrics leverage local dynamical indices (DI) derived from recent advances indynamical systems theory. DI have provided a mathematically rigorous andpurely data-driven framework for analyzing local (also referred to as instanta-neous) dynamical properties of complex systems [24]. This framework consistsof two dynamical indices: (i) the local dimension d that provides informa-tion on the system’s dynamical complexity, and (ii) the inverse persistence2θ which describes how fast the trajectory leaves the current state. Severalworks have shown that d and θ can provide useful dynamical and physicalinsights in many disciplines, including atmospheric sciences [25, 26], oceanog-raphy [27], and fluid mechanics [28]. Dynamical indices have also been recentlyapplied to identify the differences between simulated and real slow earth-quakes, showing that current numerical models may not suffice to describe thedynamical complexity of natural observations [29]. More recent developmentsintroduced a new predictability metric for dynamical systems, based on thethe DI framework [30].Since differences in dynamical indices indicate discrepancies in dynami-cal properties, we use the proposed DI-based error metrics as a quantitativemeasure of dynamical consistency for ML forecasts.Evaluating machine learning forecasts using these error metrics reveals thatML models produce larger forecast errors in regions characterized by higherdimension and lower persistence. This underscores the expected potential lim-itations in capturing complex and fast dynamics. Although the predictedsystem mean dimension and persistence closely resemble those of the truesystem, the dynamical error grows substantially with recursive predictions,indicating a decline in dynamical stability and dynamical fidelity.The proposed dynamical metrics can complement existing and standarderror metrics, providing a purely data-driven and model agnostic way ofassessing dynamical fidelity of ML forecasts.2Results2.1Error metrics and dataWe outline the proposed analysis approach on three different canonical sys-tems, namely the Lorenz-63 model (referred simply to as Lorenz datasethereafter), the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (KS), and the Kolmogorovflow (KF), and on a real-world problem, namely weather forecasting (referredsimply to as weather dataset hereafter), where we focus on the mean sea levelpressure (SLP). These are depicted in Fig. 1, where Fig. 1a illustrates theLorenz dataset, and a snapshot of the KS, KF, and weather datasets. Fig. 1b,shows the d−θ dynamical space, where d and θ are the two dynamical proper-ties that we are measuring, and that are introduced in section 4.1. Each pointin Fig. 1b represents a time snapshot, and the shape of the point clouds charac-terizes the dynamical properties of the system, with distinguishable differencesacross the different systems considered. Fig. 1c presents sample predictions ofeach system, along with the corresponding mean squared error (MSE). Fig. 1dis the dynamical space of the predicted states, colored by their MSE errors. Adetailed description of each dataset is provided in section 4.5.The ML models considered are the prevailing architectures that practition-ers are using for a range of ML forecasting tasks, namely Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (LSTM) [31],Transformers [32, 33], and the Graph Neural Networks (GNN) [34]. To ensure3a fair comparison, we perform hyperparameter optimization for each archi-tecture and input length using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)sampling algorithm [35] implemented in the open-source package Optuna [36].We additionally adopted two state-of-the-art models used for weather fore-casting applications, namely the Transformer-based Pangu-Weather model [12]and the GNN-based GraphCast model [11].LorenzKFKSa.

Panel(c): ML forecast solution, accompanied by standard forecast errors, namelyMSE (and RMSE for the weather dataset). Panel (d): Dynamical space of MLforecasts. Each forecast state is plotted at corresponding d and θ, colored bythe forecast error. The average dynamical indices of the forecasts are markedwith red triangle and text.4We measure the performance of each ML forecast using traditional errormetrics, namely MSE (and its variants), that isMSE = 1Nt1NsNtXi=1NsXi=1(ˆy −y)2,(1)where ˆy is the ML predicted solution, and y is the true value (i.e., the targetof the ML task), Nt is the number of time samples, and Ns represents thenumber of space samples (e.g., spatial locations). We then measure the MSEfor the dynamical indices d and θ, that isMSEd = 1NtNtXi=1( ˆd −d)2(2a)MSEθ = 1NtNtXi=1(ˆθ −θ)2,(2b)where ˆd, ˆθ are the ML predicted dynamical indices, and d, θ are their truevalues (i.e., the true dynamical indices of the system). In Eq. (2), we do nothave dependence on the space dimension, as the space component is con-tracted when calculating the DI, d and θ, as reported in section 4.1, where theinterested reader can find more details.Similar to MSE, MSEd and MSEθ quantify the magnitude of predictionerrors as positive values, making them suitable for both sample-wise and sta-tistical evaluation, such as computing averages over entire datasets. For taskswhere the sign of the dynamical error carries physical significance, we introduceerror metrics based on simple DI differences (briefly DID) as a sample-wisediagnostic tool, that isDIDd = ˆd −d(3a)DIDθ = ˆθ −θ.(3b)DID preserves the sign of the forecasted d and θ values relative to the groundtruth, thereby capturing whether the predicted dynamical indices are over- orunderestimated.Foreachtestcase,weconsiderbothdirectsingle-stepforecasts(section 2.2), and recursive ones (section 2.3), as these are the two main fore-casting workflows commonly adopted in machine learning.

The right column shows the d−θ space of eachforecast colored by MSE (and RMSE for the weather dataset) forecast error,alongside average true/predicted indices. At the top of each plot in the rightcolumn, we report the Wasserstein Distance (WD), that measures differencesin these (d, θ) distributions; smaller WD indicates a closer match.6The input length used is 3 time steps for the canonical datasets (i.e., Lorenz, KSand KF), and 2 time steps for the weather dataset, as the ML forecasts for thelatter are directly taken from WeatherBench2 [37] (a widely used benchmarkfor ML weather forecasting).Fig. 2a shows results for Lorenz, Fig. 2b for KS, Fig. 2c for KF, and Fig. 2dfor the weather dataset. The first column of Fig. 2 depicts MSE as a functionof the d quantile, while the second column as a function of the θ quantile. Thethird column depicts the d −θ space, colored by MSE, where we also reportthe Wasserstein Distance (WD) as the title of each plot for one of the modelsused for each dataset. Notably, MSE tends to be higher for high values of dand θ for all canonical datasets. In other words, higher complexity (high d) andlow persistence (high θ) are predictors of high MSE, for the analyzed datasets.Indeed, this behavior is also true if we were to consider other standard errormetrics – see Supplementary Information section S.2.High d and θ generally correlate with higher MSE, yet the MSE–quantilepatterns differ. For the Lorenz dataset, MSE increases for d > 0.8 andθ > 0.6, with a plateau for quantiles between 0.2 and 0.8. In contrast, KSand KF exhibit more monotonic trends, flatter in the KS case (especially forTransformer and GNN). For the weather dataset (lead time: 6 h, Weather-Bench2 [37]), fewer time snapshots yield flatter θ behavior. GraphCast showsa plateau for d (0.2–0.9) before a steep rise, whereas Pangu-Weather fluctu-ates, increasing consistently only for d > 0.7. These differences arise from (i)the diagonally-shaped d–θ space, where high complexity and low persistencemay jointly increase forecast difficulty, and (ii) the 6 h interval capturing regu-lar yet not persistent daytime fluctuations, weakening the correlation betweenθ and error.Turning to the d −θ space in the third column of Fig. 2, we observe howthe average dynamical properties for the one-step direct forecasts are similarto the true value. Yet, the distribution of the d −θ space mirrors what isobserved in terms of the MSE and d −θ quantile distributions: higher valuesof d and θ are associated with larger MSE.The results for lead time of 1 time step generalize to longer lead times, asshown in section S.3, where we conduct experiments with lead times of 10, 20,30, 40 time steps across the three canonical datasets (with the correspondingLyapunov time (LT) or time unit (TU) values shown in the figures). Ourfindings indicate a similar monotonic increase in error for KS versus d andθ, even for a large lead (3.0 LT). Additionally, the Lorenz and KF datasetsexhibit a plateau-and-rising-tail error pattern vs DI quantile.Results for mean absolute error (MAE, as defined in Eq. (9)a), normal-ized mean absolute error (NMAE, as defined in Eq. (10)a) and normalizedmean square error (NMSE, as defined in Eq. (8)a) are reported in Supple-mentary Information section S.2. Results for larger lead times and differentinput lengths are presented in Supplementary Information section S.3 and S.4,respectively. These results exhibit similar trends with those presented in thissection, further supporting the findings.7For detailed forecast error values, we refer the readers to Extend DataTab. 1, and to Supplementary Tab. S1 in Supplementary Informationsection S.1, showing MSE, MSEd, and MSEθ and their normalized variants,namely NMSE, NMSEd, and NMSEθ (defined in section 4.1). We find thatthe model with the lowest MSE does not necessarily exhibit the highestdynamical consistency, as indicated by MSEd and MSEθ. Indeed, MSE andrelated metrics might not be sufficient to detect unphysical behavior, call-ing for metrics with physical insights – see for instance the realm of weatherapplications [38, 39","In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as meanabsolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepan-cies between predictions and target values. However, these metrics do notdirectly evaluate the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts,an increasingly critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machinelearning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying sys-tem. Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machinelearning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly inapplications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecast-ing error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical propertiesof the underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently devel-oped dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension (d), and the inversepersistence (θ). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors – e.g.,higher MSE – tend to occur in states with higher d (higher complexity)and higher θ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical consistency,"

In this method, a probe emitshigh-frequency sound waves into the body, which are re-flected by heart structures and captured to generate real-time images (Figure 1(a)). However, performing cardiacultrasound scans requires the sonographer to carefully ma-neuver the probe to acquire key sectional views of the heart(Figure 1(a-b)), a task that demands extensive anatomicalknowledge and experience. This complexity, coupled with aglobal shortage of qualified sonographers, limits the acces-sibility of ultrasound services, particularly in less developedregions. This challenge has motivated the development ofprobe guidance systems [21, 32, 43, 51] capable of assist-ing less experienced sonographers or, in the longer term, en-abling fully autonomous ultrasound scanning robots. Suchsystems hold the potential to democratize cardiac care byproviding real-time, actionable feedback, which can signif-icantly improve the efficiency of the scanning process.As shown in Figure 1(c), probe guidance in echocardio-graphy can be formulated as a vision-based sequential pre-diction problem, where a model needs to predict the neces-sary probe movement vectors to reach each target view, uti-lizing historical visual-motion data. However, unlike othercomputer vision tasks in medical imaging, it presents theunique challenge of integrating motion data with dynamicvisual observations. Autonomous systems must not onlyunderstand the complex anatomical structures of the heart(e.g.chambers, valves, and vessels) but also how thesestructures are represented in ultrasound images as the probemoves and changes position. While early efforts in probeguidance [21, 43, 53] have made some progress in develop-ing assistive and autonomous scanning systems, few stud-ies focus on a fundamental problem: How can we developa principled approach that effectively learns essential med-ical knowledge while seamlessly integrating visual and mo-tion data for precise probe guidance?In this paper, we present EchoWorld, a motion-awareworld modeling framework that begins by pre-training a1arXiv:2504.13065v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025             ?

Right: The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for probe guidance, incorporating a motion-aware attentionmechanism to effectively integrate visual-motion features.strong representation model on visual-motion data, fol-lowed by fine-tuning the model with a novel motion-awareattention mechanism that allows seamless integration ofmotion information with visual features.The first stage, world model pre-training, is designedto encode rich, common-sense knowledge about the world[26, 37], which can potentially capture the heart’s anatom-ical structure and the relationships between different probepositions, allowing the system to guide a sonographer muchlike an experienced driver navigating through the city withan internalized map. As demonstrated in the left part ofFigure 2, our cardiac world model encodes two key dimen-sions of echocardiology knowledge: 1) the appearance ofanatomical structures (e.g., ventricle, valves, and septums)in cardiac ultrasound images and 2) the changing dynamicof visual signals following the probe motions.Building on this pre-trained world model, we introducea guidance prediction module with a motion-aware atten-tion mechanism that integrates historical image-pose data,as shown in the right part of Figure 2. Unlike existing meth-ods that typically organize the data into interleaved visual-action sequences, our motion-aware attention mechanismembeds 3D relative pose differences into the attention fea-tures. This enables motion-aware interactions across imageframes, allowing the system to better track anatomical struc-tures and produce more accurate predictions.Our proposed framework, EchoWorld, is built upona cardiac ultrasound scanning dataset derived from rou-tine clinical examinations.We empirically show thatEchoWorld can act as a cardiac ultrasound simulator en-riched with anatomical knowledge. Additionally, we com-pare EchoWorld against a wide range of pre-trained modelsand existing probe guidance methods. Our model consis-tently outperforms these approaches in acquiring ten stan-dard planes, achieving lower guidance errors across bothsingle-frame and sequential evaluation protocols. Analyti-cal results and ablation studies further validate the effective-ness of the proposed framework.2. Related WorkWorld Models. The concept of the world model was firstintroduced in psychology [17] and later adapted for model-predictive control [10, 11] and reinforcement learning [25–28].In these contexts, a world model typically predictsfuture states of the environment based on an agent’s ac-tions. More recently, the development of general-purposeworld models that encompass broad, commonsense under-standing has been recognized as a key step toward achievinggeneral artificial intelligence [37, 50]. The advent of large-scale video generation models has further highlighted thispotential, demonstrating their ability to serve as physicalsimulators [35, 46], driving scene simulators [23, 31, 65],2and game engines [1, 2, 60].World modeling has alsoproven to be a powerful tool for representation learning,producing structured and informative representations thatcapture complex world dynamics with minimal supervision[4–7, 24, 27–29]. Our proposed framework utilizes worldmodeling as a pretext task to develop a robust visual rep-resentation model. Our analytical experiments show thatEchoWorld effectively captures echocardiography knowl-edge for probe guidance. When augmented with a diffu-sion model, it can potentially function as a simulator forfree-hand cardiac ultrasound scanning, capable of predict-ing visual changes based on probe movements.AI for ultrasound.Recent AI advances have drivensignificant progress in ultrasound applications, advancingtasks like segmentation [19, 39, 57], 3D reconstruction [64],and diagnostic support [48, 62]. Recent efforts also focuson creating foundation models for ultrasound, as exempli-fied by USFM [34], which explores self-supervised learn-ing, and EchoCLIP [16], which utilizes multimodal learn-ing techniques.Another critical AI application in ultra-sound is probe guidance, aimed at assisting novices andinexperienced sonographers [21, 43, 51] or enabling fullyautonomous robotic scanning [53, 54]. For instance, US-GuideNet [21] provides rotational guidance for free-handobstetric ultrasound, while Shida et al. [53, 54] investigatessearch-based methods to acquire the Parasternal Long-Axis(PLAX) plane in cardiac ultrasound. Current ultrasoundprobe guidance methods primarily leverage imitation learn-ing [21, 32, 33, 40] or reinforcement learning [3, 38]. Thelatter typically relies on CT-derived simulations , whereasimitation learning—the approach adopted in our study—directly learns from expert demonstrations, presenting ascalable approach [32] in line with advances in general-purpose robotic control [9, 36, 44]. While prior research hasfocused on probe control for ultrasound scanning, little at-tention has been given to representation learning strategiesand network architectures for ultrasound data. In this paper,we seek to bridge these gaps by proposing a motion-awareworld modeling framework tailored for ultrasound.3. Background and NotationsBefore presenting our method, we briefly overview the tech-nical background relevant to the probe guidance task and theformat of the data employed in our study.3.1. Cardiac UltrasoundCardiac ultrasound, or echocardiography, involves the useof a transducer (or probe) that emits high-frequency soundwaves into the body, which are then reflected by heart struc-tures and captured to generate real-time images.Theseimages depict two-dimensional cross-sectional views, orplanes, of the heart, showcasing its chambers, walls, valves,and blood flow dynamics, and are essential for diagnosing

Remaining figure: The ten standard planestargeted for acquisition. Figures are adapted from [32, 42].a variety of cardiac conditions. The specific position, ori-entation, and tilt of the probe determine the captured plane,as shown in Figure 1(a). A standard plane in cardiac ultra-sound is a predefined cross-sectional view, systematicallyused to assess specific heart structures. For instance, theParasternal Short-Axis (PSAX) plane offers a horizontalslice through the heart, which is instrumental in evaluatingheart muscle thickness and valve function. Obtaining theseviews requires precise probe maneuvers; the sonographerskillfully maneuvers the probe on the patient’s chest, care-fully adjusting its position, angle, and pressure to capturethe desired two-dimensional “slice” of the heart.During a typical echocardiographic examination, thesonographer sequentially captures several standard planes,measuring parameters in each view before forwarding thedata for cardiologist interpretation.The probe guidancetask, aimed at supporting or potentially automating this pro-cess, involves developing models that can direct the probetowards specified target planes.This automation couldstreamline the acquisition of accurate and diagnosticallyrelevant images, making echocardiography more accessibleand consistent across varied operator skill levels.3.2. Dataset and TaskOur study is conducted based on an expert demonstrationdataset collected during routine clinical ultrasound exams,in which professional sonographers maneuvered an ultra-sound probe mounted on a robotic arm. This setup enablessynchronous recording of both image frames and probepose information, as illustrated in Figure 3. A detailed in-troduction of the dataset can be found in the appendix.The dataset is organized by “scans”, each representinga recorded examination of a patient.A scan comprisesa multi-minute echocardiography video (30 fps) and theprobe’s corresponding pose for each frame in the anatom-ical coordinate system. Formally, each scan forms a visual-motion sequence {(It, pt)}Tt=1, where T is the total numberof timesteps, It is the ultrasound image at time t, and pt de-notes the probe pose. The probe poses are represented in six3(a)(c)Context-targetRelation(b)maskcontextencodertargetencodermotionencoderlatentvariablespredictorFigure 4. Illustration of the world modeling tasks.

Each probe pose belongs to the rigid transfor-mation group, allowing us to express the relative movementbetween two poses pi and pj as pj→i = pi ·p−1j , where “·”denotes the composition of transformations. While absoluteprobe poses can vary substantially across scans, the relativemovements exhibit consistent patterns that reveal the sono-grapher’s probe maneuvers.During each scan, the sonographer visits multiple stan-dard planes, with corresponding timestamps and plane typeslabeled as ground truth for the probe guidance task. Ourgoal is to predict the relative movement from each framein the dataset to these target plane poses. Suppose the cur-rent timestep is t0 and the target standard plane is reachedat probe pose p∗, then the ground truth movement at t0 isgiven by at0 = p∗· p−1t0 . The probe guidance model lever-ages historical visual-motion data, {(It, pt)}t≤t0, to pre-dict the movement ˆat0 needed to reach the target plane. Wefocus on ten standard planes based on their clinical impor-tance and prevalence in the dataset, as shown in Figure 3.4. EchoWorldThis section presents our motion-aware world modelingframework for probe guidance, with the overall concept il-lustrated in Figure 2. We adopt a two-stage approach: a pre-training phase to construct a cardiac world model that cap-tures essential cardiac ultrasound knowledge, followed by afine-tuning phase with a motion-aware attention mechanismfor integrating historical visual-motion data effectively.4.1. Pre-training Cardiac World ModelsHumans are believed to maintain internal models that cap-ture complex patterns and dynamics of the world [17, 26,37], encoding prior knowledge that supports perception,planning, and decision-making. Similarly, an experiencedsonographer develops a mental model of the heart’s struc-tures and can anticipate visual changes as they adjust theprobe. Inspired by this, we design world modeling tasksthat equip our model with a similar understanding of car-diac anatomy and motion.A basic world modeling framework. Our world modelis based on the joint-embedding predictive architecture(JEPA) [37], illustrated in Figure 4(a). The model’s objec-tive is to predict a target y, an unobserved portion of theworld (such as the ultrasound scan in our study), using theavailable context x, conditioned on a latent variable z thatcaptures the relationship between the contexts and targets(e.g. the probe movement that leads to the visual changes).The JEPA consists of a context encoder fθ and a tar-get encoder f ′θ′, which produce context and target features,hx = fθ(x) and hy = f ′θ′(y). A predictor gϕ then pred","Echocardiography is crucial for cardiovascular diseasedetection but relies heavily on experienced sonographers.Echocardiography probe guidance systems, which providereal-time movement instructions for acquiring standardplane images, offer a promising solution for AI-assistedor fully autonomous scanning. However, developing effec-tive machine learning models for this task remains chal-lenging, as they must grasp heart anatomy and the intri-cate interplay between probe motion and visual signals.To address this, we present EchoWorld, a motion-awareworld modeling framework for probe guidance that en-codes anatomical knowledge and motion-induced visual dy-namics, while effectively leveraging past visual-motion se-quences to enhance guidance precision. EchoWorld em-ploys a pre-training strategy inspired by world modelingprinciples, where the model predicts masked anatomical re-gions and simulates the visual outcomes of probe adjust-ments. Built upon this pre-trained model, we introduce amotion-aware attention mechanism in the fine-tuning stagethat effectively integrates historical visual-motion data, en-abling precise and adaptive probe guidance. Trained onmore than one million ultrasound images from over 200routine scans, EchoWorld effectively captures key echocar-diographic knowledge, as validated by qualitative analysis.Moreover, our method significantly reduces guidance er-"

Note that some low DSC values for specific λ valueswere due to pruning by Optuna.35 To provide an intuitive comparison of MI and CR performance, we alsoinclude contour plots composed of scatter points. It is evident that when using MI, the optimal DSC values fallwithin a narrower range of λ values, indicating high sensitivity and a need for precise selection of λ. In contrast,when using CR, the optimal λ results in a slightly lower DSC score compared to that of MI, but it retains morestable DSC values across a broader range of λ values. It is noteworthy that the optimal λ values differ betweenVoxelMorph (4.5 for MI and 7.7 for CR) and TransMorph (1.7 for MI and 4.2 for CR), suggesting that differentDNNs may favor different λ. This leads to an area of interest that requires further research.3.3 Qualitative and Quantitative ResultsQualitative results are shown in Fig. 2 (d). The first row displays the deformed results from different methods,with three anatomical regions contoured: the cerebral white matter in blue, the lateral ventricles in red, andthe hippocampus in yellow. The scores at the bottom of the images correspond to the DSC, the percentage ofNDV, and the percentage of voxels with |J(ϕ)| ≤0. The second row depicts the respective deformation fieldsϕ. Quantitative results on the test set are shown in Table 1. When trained with CR, the models achievedslightly lower DSC scores using TransMorph but comparable DSC scores with VoxelMorph compared to thosetrained with MI. This finding suggests that CR and MI are similarly effective as similarity measures for brainimage registration. However, there are merits in adopting CR, as demonstrated by two illustrative examples inFigs. 2 (b) and (c). These figures show the objective value (the lower, the better) versus the degree of translationand rotation, where CR demonstrated a smoother landscape, making it less likely to get stuck in local minima.Additionally, we compared the computational speed of the two similarity measures on an H100 GPU for an imagepair of size 160 × 192 × 224, averaged over 100 runs. CR achieved a computation speed of 0.026 seconds, whileMI achieved 0.149 seconds, making CR almost 6-fold faster than MI. This significant speed advantage makesCR potentially suitable for applications such as instance-specific optimization and registration guided surgicalapplications.4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we proposed a differentiable implementation of CR for multi-modal deformable image registration,utilizing the Parzen windowing approximation to avoid discretely counting intensity bins, inspired by the recentlydeveloped Parzen-window-based MI.13 The hyperparameter trade-off between the similarity measure and thedeformation regularizer, previously subject to arbitrary choice, underwent extensive experimentation to determinethe optimal value. The proposed method was validated on T1w-to-T2w registration using the IXI dataset.Experimental results demonstrate that the method is applicable to different networks, performing competitivelywith MI but computing significantly faster. Future work will focus on comparing additional similarity measuresfor multi-modal registration.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by the grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), United States.

Thisapproach involves training a registration network using pairs of moving and fixed images, along with a lossfunction that combines an image similarity measure and deformation regularization. For multi-modal imageregistration tasks, the correlation ratio has been a widely-used image similarity measure historically, yet it has beenunderexplored in current deep learning methods. Here, we propose a differentiable correlation ratio to use as a lossfunction for learning-based multi-modal deformable image registration. This approach extends the traditionallynon-differentiable implementation of the correlation ratio by using the Parzen windowing approximation, enablingbackpropagation with deep neural networks. We validated the proposed correlation ratio on a multi-modalneuroimaging dataset. In addition, we established a Bayesian training framework to study how the trade-offbetween the deformation regularizer and similarity measures, including mutual information and our proposedcorrelation ratio, affects the registration performance.

E-mail(s): picchini@chalmers.se;Contributing authors: henhagg@chalmers.se; sebastian.persson@crick.ac.uk;marija.cvijovic@chalmers.se;1 IntroductionThe analysis of data arising from multiple experi-ments — such as observations of individuals acrossvarious domains (e.g., humans, animals, cells, ortrees) — has traditionally been approached usingmixed-effects models (Diggle et al. 2002; Lavielle2014). These models account for individual vari-ability by treating model parameters as randomvariables that vary between subjects, allowing ahierarchical representation of the data. This struc-ture effectively disentangles different sources ofvariability, distinguishing intra-individual fluctua-tions from between-individual differences. Mixed-effects modeling is widely applied across diversefields, including biology, pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics, forestry, sociology, and manyother disciplines where understanding variabilityacross individuals is essential (Davidian and Gilti-nan 2003). The literature to tackle the inference1arXiv:2504.11279v1 [stat.CO] 15 Apr 2025problem for mixed-effects models is vast. How-ever, options reduce substantially when stochasticdynamical models are considered due to consid-erably increased theoretical and computationaldifficulties. In this work, we present a new strat-egy for Bayesian inference in hierarchical non-linear stochastic models with mixed-effects. Ourapproach provides fast to train semi-amortizedapproximations to both the likelihood functionand the posterior distribution. We show that thismakes our methodology scalable for an increasingnumber of individuals. In particular, we considerstochastic models with time-dynamics, with afocus on stochastic differential equations (SDEs)with mixed-effects. However, this is merely to pro-vide illustrative case studies, as the methodologywe introduce is agnostic to the specific type ofmodel used to describe data.Inference for stochastic modelling with mixed-effects is a challenging area due to the difficulty in(numerically) integrating out the latent quantitiesthat enter the likelihood function. For exam-ple, models for stochastic chemical reactions thatare common in systems biology involve eitherexact simulators (e.g. the Stochastic SimulationAlgorithm, Gillespie 1977, the Extrande method,Voliotis et al. 2016) or approximate simulators(Gillespie 2000, Gillespie 2007), and all these makethe likelihood function intractable, that is, it isnot possible to evaluate it exactly and is com-putationally hard to approximate. For example,when the model is an SDE, and observations areavailable at discrete time points, the likelihoodfunction is typically intractable (except for thesimplest toy models) due to the unavailability ofclosed-form transition densities. The statistical lit-erature to tackle such difficulty is vast, see eg.Craigmile et al. (2023) for a recent review. Ontop of such difficulty, when SDEs are embedded ina mixed-effects framework, the problem becomeseven harder due to the increased dimension ofthe integration problem. Although the literaturefor mixed-effect SDEs is available, as collectedin Picchini (2024), this is very specialized, asmethods either tackle very specific models, lack-ing generality and well-maintained software, or aregeneral but computationally very intensive, e.g.when based on particle-filters (Botha et al. 2021;Wiqvist et al. 2021; Persson et al. 2022).In this work, we provide a general approachfor Bayesian inference in mixed-effects modelshaving intractable likelihoods, using simulation-based inference (SBI) (see Cranmer et al. 2020for a review). The appeal of SBI methods isthat these only require forward-simulation of themodel, rather than the evaluation of a potentiallycomplicated expression for the likelihood function,assuming it is available. This allows for approxi-mate frequentist and Bayesian inference, wheneverrunning the model simulator at many values of aparameter θ is computationally not too onerous.Indeed, in SBI, simulated data y are generated asθ →M(θ) →y, where the simulator M can beany generative model. Provided with many pairsof simulated θ’s and y’s, it is possible to buildinference for given observed data yo, in absenceof a readily available expression for the likeli-hood function p(yo|θ), as we briefly summarizein Section 2. In recent years many SBI methodshave focused on using deep neural networks toapproximate conditional densities (“neural condi-tional density estimation”), for example to provideapproximations to the posterior p(θ|yo), the like-lihood p(yo|θ), or both, see Section 2 for key ref-erences. In our work, we obtain scalable and accu-rate inference for complex stochastic models withmixed-effects, without using neural conditionaldensity estimation. We build on the SEquen-tial Mixtures Posterior and Likelihood Estima-tion (SeMPLE) methodology (H¨aggstr¨om et al.2024), which efficiently fits training data usinga Gaussian mixture model via an expectation-maximization algorithm. The fitted Gaussian mix-ture provides, simultaneously, a closed-form deter-ministic approximation to both the likelihood andthe posterior, which can both be evaluated andsampled from in a Gibbs sampler. For the casewhere M individuals are considered, with corre-sponding observed data y(i)o(i = 1, ..., M), thesurrogates of the likelihood and the posterior con-structed by SeMPLE are called “semi-amortized”,since an initial amortized approximation of thelikelihood p(y|θ) for a generic y is first obtained,and then rapidly adapted to the individual-specificdata y(i)o , providing and approximation to theindividual p(y(i)o |θ), without having to re-startseparate fittings completely from scratch for everyindividual i, but instead starting from the amor-tized approximation.We present two versions of SeMPLE, bothdelivering accurate inference, as demonstrated2through comparisons with exact (pseudomarginal)Bayesian inference. The first version offers greaterflexibility by allowing the specification of bothfixed parameters and random effects, althoughat a higher computational cost. In contrast, thesecond version is designed for enhanced scala-bility, but requires all parameters to be treatedas random effects. To illustrate our methodology,we applied it to three case studies: a mixed-effects Ornstein-Uhlenbeck state-space model anda mixed-effects SDE model used to describe trans-lation kinetics following mRNA transfection. Thelatter model is examined using both simulated andreal-world data. The code is available at https://github.com/henhagg/semple mem.2 Related workSimulation-basedinference(SBI)methods,reviewed e.g. in Cranmer et al. (2020) andPesonen et al. (2023), have also been called“likelihood-free inference”, where the latter hasbeen used especially with reference to approxi-mate Bayesian computation (ABC) (Marin et al.2012; Sisson et al. 2018), synthetic likelihoods(Wood 2010; Price et al. 2018) and, partially,pseudomarginal Markov chain Monte Carlo meth-ods (Andrieu and Roberts 2009; Andrieu et al.2010) when simple forward simulation is possible(as when the bootstrap filter is used to unbias-edly approximate the likelihood). The mentionedapproaches have also been denoted as “statisti-cal SBI” in Wang et al. (2024), to distinguishthose from more recent methods exploiting neuralnetworks (typically normalizing flows, Rezendeand Mohamed 2015; Papamakarios et al. 2021)to approximate conditional densities, so-calledneural conditional density estimation (NCDE),which have gained considerable attention. NCDEhas been used to approximate likelihoods (Papa-makarios et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2021), posteriordistributions (Papamakarios and Murray 2016;Greenberg et al. 2019; Durkan et al. 2020; Chenet al. 2021; Miller et al. 2021; Delaunoy et al.2022), or the likelihood and the posterior simul-taneously (Wiqvist et al. 2021; Radev et al.2023). Moreover, NCDE approaches have beenused both to sequentially refine inference con-ditionally on a specific observed data set yo,but also in an amortized way, see the review inZammit-Mangion et al. (2024). For amortizedapproaches, the trained network does not dependon any specific yo and therefore, once traininghas completed, it can be used to rapidly produceconditional density estimation for any yo, thoughthis happens at a large upfront resource invest-ment to obtain the amortized network in thefirst place. Regarding non-amortized approaches,comparisons between some of the methods areavailable, e.g., in Greenberg et al. (2019) andH¨aggstr¨om et al. (2024).For the specific case of non-SBI inferencefor mixed-effects stochastic dynamic models, therange of inference options is large (Picchini 2024).However, this range shrinks considerably whenSBI methods are considered: for the latter, meth-ods for mixed-effects stochastic dynamic modelsrevolve almost exclusively around pseudomarginalMCMC (pMCMC) (Whitaker et al. 2017; Wiqvistet al. 2021; Botha et al. 2021; Persson et al. 2022),and an exception within SBI is the NCDE-basedposterior inference in Arruda et al. (2024). Theadvantage of pMCMC methods is that they pro-duce exact Bayesian inference in the limit of aninfinite number of MCMC iterations. Therefore,when it is possible to use pMCMC, this pro-vides gold-standard Bayesian inference. However,in practice, for pMCMC to be effective, advancedproposal mechanisms for the solution paths of themodels are often needed, to reduce the varianceof Monte-Carlo based likelihood approximations(typically via particle filters) and hence reduce theruntime to properly explore the posterior surface.In pMCMC, constructing proposals for the solu-tion’s paths is a challenging and highly-specializedtask (examples are Golightly and Wilkinson 2011;Del Moral and Murray 2015; Schauer et al. 2017),and bespoke constructions often need to be pro-duced for any different attempted model and oftendepend on specific assumptions on the measure-ment error (e.g, a linear observation model withGaussian measurement error). Moreover, the tun-ing of the parameter proposal in pMCMC (andespecially its initialization) can be tedious andprone to trial-and-error. This is why alternativeSBI methods that rely solely on ”simple” forwardmodel simulation are particularly appealing, asthey facilitate learning the mapping between sim-ulated θ and simulated y. In our work, the goalis to construct surrogate deterministic approxi-mations of the likelihood and posterior, rather3than stochastic likelihood approximations as gen-erated in pMCMC. In doing so, we do not employneural conditional density estimation, in contrastto Arruda et al. (2024), and instead providea more parsimonious framework which is nev-ertheless expressive enough to produce accurateBayesian inference. Before moving further, wewish to remind the reader that in SBI it is typicalto conduct inference based on a “summarization”S(y) (provided by a data-reduction mapping) ofy, rather than inference based on y itself, whereS(y) is a set of statistics of y that are deemedinformative about θ (Fearnhead and Prangle 2012;Wiqvist et al. 2019; ˚Akesson et al. 2021) butare low-dimensional compared to y. In our exam-ples we do not consider data-summarization, andtherefore we do not discuss this aspect further,however our methodology could accommodateinference based on some S(y) should it be neces-sary, and in such case all the instances where yappears could be substituted with S(y).3 Stochastic differentialequation mixed-effectsmodelsAs mentioned in the introduction, we may con-sider any generative model M to describe time-dynamics in the data. We choose to provideillustrations based on models employing stochas-tic differential equations, however these could besubstituted with other models, for example solversfor Markov jump processes for stochastic chem-ical reactions. Consider data from a populationof M individuals. Assume that the dynamics foreach individual i are described by a stochasticprocess {X(i)t }t≥0 indexed by t (where t often indi-cates time though it can be something differentas well), where X(i)t∈Rd for every t and everyi = 1, ..., M. Assume dynamics governed by thefollowing stochastic differential equations (SDEs)dX(i)t= µ(Xt, c(i), κ, t)dt + σ(Xt, c(i), κ, t)dB(i)tX(i)0= x(i)0i = 1, ..., M,c(i)∼π(c | η),i = 1, ..., M,(1)where µ is a d-dimensional drift vector, the diffu-sion coefficient σ is a d×d positive definite matrix,each B(i)tdenotes a vector of d independentWiener processes. In (1) we assume individual-specific parameters c(i) ∈Rq, while κ ∈Rp iscommon to all individuals. For the individual-specific parameters we assume c(i) ∼π(c | η) (i =1, . . . , M) and we denote their collection across allsubjects as c = (c(1), . . . , c(M)). The parameterη is called “population parameter” as it is under-lying the distribution of all the c(i), and as suchit does not vary with i. Similarly, parameter κ isalso assumed not to vary with i and as such iscommon to all subjects, however, unlike η for thec(i)’s, κ does not identify the distribution of anyother random parameter.The process {X(i)t } may be observed directly(ie without error) or indirectly: here we considerthe general observational model (2) where it isalso possible to have noisy observations y(i)tthatare conditionally independent (given the latentprocess), and that are linked to {X(i)t } viaY (i)t= g(X(i)t , ε(i)t ),ε(i)t∼πε(ξ)1, . . . , M,(2)where ε(i)trepresents measurement errors with dis-tribution πε(ξ) parameterised by the vector ξ ∈Rs, and g(·) is a (possibly non-linear) function. Weexemplify the dependence relationship betweenthe introduced parameters and the stochastic pro-cesses in Figure 1. Evidently, if we assume nomeasurement error, then the observations y(i)are direct (error-free) observations of {X(i)t }t≥0.Say that Y (i)t∈Rdo where do ≤d, and thatobservations are collected at discrete time-points{t1, t2, ..., tn}, then we can have the case whereat observational time tj the observation y(i)tj is avector of length do (j = 1, ..., n), where do = d cor-responds to the system being fully observed at tj,whereas having do < d opens up for {X(i)t } being“partially observed”. A typical example would beY (i)tj = F (i)tj X(i)tj + ε(i)tj , where the F (i)tj are do × dmatrices of known coefficients. In the notationintroduced, we assumed for simplicity that theobservational times are the same for all individu-als, but we could have also used {t(i)1 , t(i)2 , ..., t(i)ni }and assumed that the set of observations are of dif-ferent lengths ni for different individuals: this canbe handled in our framework but we decided tokeep the notation lighter. The vector of observeddata for subject i is therefore y(i)o= (y(i)1,o, ..., y(i)n,o)4where we used the shorthand y(i)j≡y(i)tj . The fullset of observations stacks all individual observa-tions as yo = (y(1)o , ..., y(M)o)T. To simplify thereading, in next sections we will use y to denotea generic dataset, observed or simulated, and wewill distinguish the two cases only when necessary.Equations (1)-(2) define a very flexible model,a stochastic differential equation mixed-effectsmodel (SDEMEM), which is able to represent(i) stochastic intra-individual variation (via thediffusion terms in the SDEs), (ii) between indi-viduals variation (via th","The analysis of data from multiple experiments, such as observations of several individuals, iscommonly approached using mixed-effects models, which account for variation between individualsthrough hierarchical representations. This makes mixed-effects models widely applied in fields such asbiology, pharmacokinetics, and sociology. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for scalableBayesian inference in hierarchical mixed-effects models. Our framework first constructs amortizedapproximations of the likelihood and the posterior distribution, which are then rapidly refined for eachindividual dataset, to ultimately approximate the parameters posterior across many individuals. Theframework is easily trainable, as it uses mixtures of experts but without neural networks, leading toparsimonious yet expressive surrogate models of the likelihood and the posterior. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our methodology using challenging stochastic models, such as mixed-effects stochas-tic differential equations emerging in systems biology-driven problems. However, the approach isbroadly applicable and can accommodate both stochastic and deterministic models. We show that ourapproach can seamlessly handle inference for many parameters. Additionally, we applied our methodto a real-data case study of mRNA transfection. When compared to exact pseudomarginal Bayesianinference, our approach proved to be both fast and competitive in terms of statistical accuracy.Keywords: hie"

We assess the model’sperformance by optimizing only the text embeddings, with-out fine-tuning the transformer layers. The quantitative re-sults in Table 4 show that subject fidelity is significantlylower when training only the embeddings than training boththe embeddings and the transformer layers. Since the di-mension of a single token embedding is limited to 4096,training only the embeddings is insufficient to capture thecomplex appearance of the subject. Therefore, fine-tuningthe full model is necessary for optimal performance.The qualitative comparison is shown in Figure 6. The sec-ond and third columns display images generated by modelsfine-tuned only on text embeddings. Although these mod-els are able to capture basic elements of the subject, likecolor, shape, and texture, they struggle to reproduce thosefine details that define the subject’s identity, often resultingin unrealistic or distorted patterns. For example, in the thirdand fourth rows, the boot has two tips, and the dog appearswith two bodies. Additionally, due to the limited capacityof text embeddings, the subject sometimes fails to appear asthe main focus in the image, as seen in the first row wherethe backpack is nearly invisible.7Training Images: backpack“A backpack on the beach”“A backpack in the jungle”“A backpack floating on top of water”Training Images: sneaker“A sneaker”“A sneaker in the jungle”“A sneaker floating on top of water”Training Images: cat“A cat”“A cat in the jungle”“A cat wearing a santa hatTraining Images: dog“A dog”“A dog in the jungle”“A dog wearing a santa hat”Free-form prompts with the class nameTraining imagesFigure 5.

The middle row of Figure 7 displays themodel’s attempts to produce artistic renditions of the object.While the model successfully transfers a candle into VanGogh’s style, it fails with the other two styles. In the pencilsketch and Chinese ink painting examples, the model recog-nizes the styles but misinterprets them as objects rather thanapplying them to the subject. This issue may stem from thetoken-based nature of the auto-regressive model, which as-sociates the identifier “[v]” with image tokens of the inputsubject. Artistic renditions, however, requires replacing thesubject with entirely different tokens. As a result, the modelcircumvents the challenge by reflecting the keywords as ob-jects rather than applying the intended styles.Property modification. Figure 3 illustrates some cases ofproperty modification. The model performs well with sim-ple tasks, such as altering color or shape. However, it strug-gles with more complex feature combinations. For exam-ple, in the top-left corners of the bottom row of Figure 7, themodel fails to merge features of two animals (e.g., “a dogpanda” or “a dog lion”). Instead, it generates the second an-imal mentioned in the prompt only, completely omitting the“dog”. When the prompt aims to combine features of thespecific Chow Chow dog with another species, the modelpartially incorporates elements of the dog but fails to cre-ate a cohesive fusion. This limitation mirrors the challengesseen in artistic renditions, highlighting the model’s lack offlexibility in handling advanced feature integration.6. ConclusionIn this paper, we demonstrate the potential of auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis througha two-stage training strategy, first optimizing text em-bedding and then fine-tuning transformer. Our approachachieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt followingto the state-of-the-art stable diffusion-based methodssuch as DreamBooth [26].However, auto-regressivemodels are slow, taking minutes to generate images,and the fine-tuning also requires 15-20 minutes, limitingreal-time applicability. Additionally, the ability to createpersonalized images raises ethical concerns,such asmisuse for misleading content, a challenge common to allgenerative models. Future work should focus on improvingefficiency, addressing ethical risks, and ensuring responsi-ble advancements in personalized generative technologies.","Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal ap-plication in text-to-image generation, enabling the creationof images featuring specific subjects in diverse contexts.While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for textand image modeling, remain underexplored for personal-ized image generation.

In response, we introduceAi2 Scholar QA, a free-to-use scientific QA system(qa.allen.ai), and share our key components asopen source software and public APIs.Scholar QA follows a multi-stage pipeline (Fig-ure 1) that starts by querying paper indexes: one* Core contributors1We use closed state-of-the-art LLMs.from Semantic Scholar with over 100M abstracts,and a new index that we introduce in this workcontaining 11.7M full-text scientific papers. Thepipeline then re-ranks the retrieved passages witha cross-encoder, and finally prompts a Large Lan-guage Model (LLM) to filter, cluster, and synthe-size the passages into an answer. The final answeris presented to the user in a report with expand-able sections of prose, bulleted lists, and tables.Claims in the answer are supported by citations,which can be clicked to reveal the cited paper’stitle and authors (with links to their correspondingSemantic Scholar pages), and in many cases rele-vant excerpt(s) from the paper, allowing for quickverification of the claim.The system is based on open source code, en-abling the community to reproduce and build onit. We release the code for our pipeline, prompt-ing workflow and Web application. The retrievalindexes, including the new full text search index,are available as Semantic Scholar APIs and datasetdownloads, and are continually updated with newarticles (Kinney et al., 2023). Together, these re-sources can be combined with any generative LLMAPI to power a complete long-form scientific QAapplication. Our production system currently usesAnthropic’s Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2024).We present analyses that justify key design de-cisions in our architecture in §4. Our choice ofretrieval models and configuration is informed byevaluation over a collection of real and syntheticuser queries and accompanying passages judged forrelevance by a LLM, both of which we release pub-licly. We compare Scholar QA’s answers againstseveral baselines, demonstrating that it achievesstate-of-the-art performance on the ScholarQA-CSbenchmark (Asai et al., 2024). Finally, we discussthe reception of Scholar QA by users. The strongmajority (85%) of user feedback is positive, and thereported issues suggest important improvementsfor future work.1arXiv:2504.10861v1 [cs.CL] 15 Apr 2025Extract quotes from passagesRetrieval (§2.1)Reranker (§2.2)Cross-Encoder RerankerTop 50-ranked PassagesQuery Validation with omni-moderation-latest11.7M full-text papersINPUT User QueryScholarQAMulti-Step Generation (§2.3)…Per paper, aggregate passages“ ”“” “ ”“ ”Per paper, per passage, extract quotes Cluster Extracted QuotesBuild answer outline & synthesize extracted quotes to outline.

Next, we describeeach component of the pipeline in detail.Query Validation. Prior to processing a query,we employ OpenAI’s omni-moderation-latest2model for safeguarding against potentially harmfulcontent and return appropriate error messages.2.1RetrievalWe use the Semantic Scholar API (Kinney et al.,2023) for retrieval, specifically its endpoint for key-word search over paper abstracts, and our new end-point for querying snippets from open-access pa-pers. A query decomposer re-formulates the userquery for each endpoint and retrieves up to 256snippets and 20 abstracts. These texts are referredto as ""passages"" below.Query Decomposer. The two retrieval endpointsdiffer in their effective query formats (one targetskeyword and the other semantic queries) and filter-ing of results based on the user’s preferences for pa-per metadata (paper year, venue, field of study). Inour query decomposition step, an LLM is promptedto re-format the user query into paraphrases appro-priate for each endpoint, and to extract the user’srequested settings for the metadata filters. We usethe outputs of this step for retrieval.Search APIs.The Semantic Scholar keywordsearch API is described in Kinney et al. (2023). Weintroduce a new /snippet/search endpoint, whichsearches over a corpus of passages extracted fromS2ORC (Lo et al., 2020), loaded into a Vespa clus-ter with papers and passages. Papers include meta-data for filtering. Passages are derived from a pa-2https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderationper’s title, abstract, or body and can be filtered atthe paper level. The index includes 11.7M full-textpapers across the fields of study listed here, and atotal of 285.6M passages.Each passage is limited to 480 tokens and trun-cated at sentence and section boundaries wherepossible, having an overlap of one sentence (upto 64 tokens) with the preceding and follow-ing passages.Passage text is embedded withmxbai-embed-large-v1 (Lee et al., 2024) withbinary quantization, and placed into a dense (ap-proximate nearest neighbor) index, as well as atraditional sparse keyword index.We first retrieve a union of embedding andkeyword-based matches, applying any specified fil-ters. The filtered results are ranked with a weightedsum of embedding similarity and bm25 scores.2.2RerankingThe passages obtained from the retrieval step aresubsequently passed to a neural re-ranker and thetop 50 results are retained.The re-ranker is across-encoder that encodes both the query and acandidate document simultaneously and outputs arelevance score used to rank the documents. Weselected mxbai-rerank-large-v1 (Shakir et al.,2024) based on the results in §4.2 and host it onModal with a single NVIDIA L40S GPU.2.3Multi-step GenerationThe generation phase employs a three-step ap-proach: first, the retrieved passages are processedto extract more precise quotes relevant to the query;second, the quotes are thematically clustered intoseparate sections appropriate for the answer; finally,a controlled generation process composes the finalreport one section at a time, synthesizing the quotesassigned to that section.Quote extraction.Passages from the retrievalstage can be lengthy and may contain extraneousinformation not useful for answering the user query(Asai et al., 2023). The quote extraction stage aims2to select only the most relevant quotes from thepassages to improve the precision of the answer.We instruct an LLM to extract verbatim quotesthat directly contribute to answering the query (Slo-bodkin et al., 2024). As input to the extraction, wegather all passages from the re-ranker for a givenpaper, and concatenate these to the abstract of thepaper. This aggregation helps create a richer con-text conducive to extracting relevant quotes. TheLLM processes each paper’s content independentlyand returns the selected quotes separated by el-lipses. If the entire paper context is deemed irrele-vant, it is discarded from further processing.Answer Outline and Clustering. For generatinga comprehensive research report, the effective or-ganization of reference materials is essential for itsoverall coherence. We propose a thematic outlineframework where the answer is divided into sec-tions representing topics, and the reference quotesare assigned to these topics. This mapping allowsthe system to selectively focus only on the pertinentsubset of quotes when synthesizing a section.First, the LLM is instructed to generate a list ofthemes in logical order and the appropriate syn-thesis format for each theme, independent of thequotes from the previous step. The first section is al-ways an introduction or background to provide theuser the basics for understanding the answer. Theformat of each section can be either a paragraph ora bulleted list, serving different information needs.Paragraphs convey nuanced summaries from multi-ple papers, while bulleted lists enumerate relatedpapers (e.g., models, datasets, or interactive sys-tems). These list are also the catalyst for generatingthe comparison tables (see §2.3). Following this,the sections are assigned 0 or more quotes. In caseno quote is assigned to a section, it is generatedcompletely from the LLM weights.Report Generation. With the answer outline inplace, each section of the report is synthesized se-rially conditioned on the query, reference sources,and the sections prior to it. The LLM is also in-structed to generate a TLDR for each section. Thereferences are either the quotes assigned to the sec-tion or abstracts of papers that are cited within thesequotes. This citation following method allows theLLM to condition on and cite foundational sourceswhich are not uncovered in retrieval. The LLM isinstructed to cite the sources for each claim in thegenerated section text and cite generations from itsparameters as LLM Memory.Paper Comparison Table Generation. Since bul-leted list sections typically include closely relatedpapers (e.g., different datasets), we additionallygenerate tables that compare and contrast all pa-pers cited in that section using common aspects(e.g., size and annotation method). This pipeline isdetailed in Newman et al. (2024). At a high level,the inputs are the query to Scholar QA, the sectiontitle, and the abstracts of all papers cited in thesection. An LLM first produces a set of commonaspects (columns) to compare papers (rows). Eachcell (paper-aspect pair) is filled with a value usingthe full-text of the paper. Finally, as not all aspectsare applicable to every paper (e.g., one paper mightnot be about a dataset), we filter out columns androws with a high proportion of missing values. Fig-ure 3 [A] shows an expanded table in Scholar QAwhere related papers from a section are comparedacross a set of common aspects ([B]).3Scholar QA: Interface and Source CodeScholar QA is open-sourced as an extensiblePython package (ai2-scholar-qa) and a Type-script and React-based interactive web application.The LLM functionality of Scholar QA is imple-mented with litellm, which supports swapping avariety of models using your own keys. Thus, thecommunity can build upon Scholar QA and easilyvisualize the results (examples in Appendix A). Be-low we describe the user experience of the demo.3Progress and Section Streaming.High systemlatency can hinder usability. On average, ScholarQA produces a full report in 2.5 minutes (N=500,σ=70s), which is comparable to modern LLM-based research tools. To further improve usability,the following designs were used: 1) Displayingdetailed real-time progress of the system (Nielsen,1994) so users can examine the number of papers,passages, and sections being processed. 2) Present-ing each section as soon as it is generated, so userscan begin browsing the first section in 50 seconds(N=500, σ=24s) post issuing a query (Appendix H).Expandable Sections.By default, sections arecollapsed showing only their titles, TLDR sum-maries, and number of cited sources. This givesusers a gist of the information included in the re-port (Figure 2 [A]). Users can then click on the titleof a section they wish to read to expand it ([B]).3Our production system has a few additional features likedownloadable reports, login and links to other Ai2 systems.3Figure 2: Multi-section [B] report generated by Scholar QA.

While concept erasuremethods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leadingto visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on theheuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome theseshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbedANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectoriesto avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight:reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guid-ance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precisecontent modification without sacrificing early-stage struc-tural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objectivethat preserves the integrity of the early-stage score functionfield—which steers samples toward the natural image mani-fold—without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection.For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify thecritical parameters that most significantly contribute tothe unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and effi-cient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective func-tion offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that signifi-cantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demon-strate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both sin-gle and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safeoutputs without compromising the generative fidelity. Codeis available at https://github.com/lileyang1210/ANT.1. IntroductionConcept erasure in text-to-image (T2I) models [5, 11, 60,67, 69, 71, 86] addresses the critical challenge of prevent-ing the generation of harmful or inappropriate visual con-tent, such as violent, explicit, copyright-infringing, or of-fensive imagery. Current methods for concept erasure can∗Equal contributionbe broadly categorized into two types: (1) finetuning-basedmethods [19, 55, 57], which directly modify model param-eters, and (2) finetuning-free methods [33, 58, 73], whichaim to influence model outputs without parameter updates.However, finetuning-free methods are vulnerable to bypass-ing when the source code is openly available, thus mak-ing finetuning-based methods more effective and secure forpublicly accessible models.Finetuning-basedmethodsremoveundesirabledata modes by altering the predicted score functionfield—essentially, modifying the gradient directions thatsamples follow during the denoising process—to avoidconverging toward undesirable image distributions. Asa result of finetuning, the predicted score function nolonger accurately reflects the true gradient direction indata space that would further increase likelihood. Themain difference among finetuning-based techniques lies inhow the conditional score function is modified, which canbe broadly divided into anchor-free and anchor-basedapproaches.Anchor-free methods [3, 7, 8, 10, 19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 32,35, 37–39, 53, 57–59, 72, 73, 80, 81, 84, 85, 87, 88, 95, 100]often design a loss to adjust the conditional score functionthroughout the denoising process, encouraging samples tomove away from unwanted image manifolds without explic-itly specifying a target manifold (see Figure 1(b)). However,this approach can disrupt the sampling trajectories towardnatural image manifolds. As shown in Figure 1(a), diffusionmodels typically first guide samples from Gaussian noisetoward the manifold of natural images to establish a plau-sible layout, and then progressively refine the details dur-ing the mid-to-late denoising steps [41, 55]. By solely em-phasizing the movement away from unwanted manifolds,anchor-free methods risk causing samples to deviate fromthe natural image manifold early on, potentially resulting ingenerated images with visual artifacts or unintended content(see the second row of Figure 2).Anchor-based methods [2–4, 6, 9, 15, 16, 20, 23, 26,31, 36, 40, 43, 48, 49, 52, 55, 62, 74, 78, 82, 89, 90, 99, 102],on the other hand, typically utilize a loss designed to lever-age benign anchor concepts by aligning the predicted condi-1arXiv:2504.12782v1 [cs.CV] 17 Apr 2025Figure 1. Geometric perspective on concept erasure in diffusion models. (a) Conventional Denoising Trajectory. A high-dimensionalGaussian sample, starting on a large sphere, converges to the human data manifold via classifier-free guidance (CFG). (b) Anchor-FreeFinetuned Trajectory. Finetuning often modifies the orientation of the predicted conditional score functions so that they direct away fromthe unwanted concept manifold. This results in a condition direction δ(c) = ϵθ(zt, t, c) −ϵθ(zt, t) nearly opposite to that of the originalmodel, making the trajectory more likely to produce out-of-distribution samples. Note that, in the absence of an unconditional constraint,modifications to the conditional output also affect the unconditional output due to shared model parameters. (c) Anchor-Based FinetunedTrajectory. The model is finetuned so that the predicted score functions (or keys & values) for the unwanted concept align with thoseof the original model conditioned on a benign anchor, ensuring final samples lie on the anchor manifold, though not necessarily at thehighest-probability mode. (d) Our Trajectory (ANT). In the early stage (when t > t′), the conditional score functions remain directedtoward the natural data mode, keeping the finetuned model aligned with the original. When t < t′, they are finetuned to point away fromthe unwanted concept manifold. ANT encourages that unconditional score functions remain unchanged throughout all stages.tional score functions (or keys & values) for unwanted con-cepts with those associated with anchor concepts (see Fig-ure 1(c)). By aligning score functions of unwanted conceptswith those of anchor concepts, these methods ensure thatsamples conditioned on unwanted concepts ultimately con-verge towards images depicting the anchor concepts. Thus,anchor-based approaches are not merely repelling samplesfrom undesired modes. Nevertheless, the effectiveness ofthese methods critically depends on the proper selection ofanchor concepts. As demonstrated in the third row of Fig-ure 2, some seemingly reasonable anchor concept choicescan reduce the quality of images generated when condi-tioned on erased concepts. Currently, selecting effective an-chor concepts remains largely heuristic, lacking systematicguidelines.Motivated by these limitations, we propose a trajectory-awarefinetuningframework,termedANT,whichAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoidunwanted concepts. This approach achieves its goal with-out negatively affecting early-stage score function fields orrelying on heuristic anchor concept selection. Specifically,we discovered that reversing the condition direction ofclassifier-free guidance (CFG) [29] during the mid-to-latedenoising stage enables modification of detailed contentwhile preserving the fundamental structure of the generatedimage. This finding inspires us to develop a trajectory-aware objective function that preserves the early-stagescore function, steering samples toward the natural imagemanifold, while eliminating the need for anchor concepts(Figure 1(d)). This approach enables more effective erasureof undesired concepts while better preserving those thatare unrelated. In the context of single-concept erasure, weintroduce an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency mapthat accurately identifies the key parameters most respon-sible for generating a specific concept. Moreover, our lossfunction is fully compatible with existing multi-concepterasure frameworks, offering a flexible plug-and-play solu-tion, and elevates the performance to a new state-of-the-art(SOTA) level. Our experimental results demonstrate thatour method achieves SOTA performance in both singleand multi-concept erasure settings. Our contributions aresummarized as follows:1. We offer a geometric perspective on concept erasureand an insight that reversing the condition direction ofclassifier-free guidance during the mid-to-late denoisingstages enables precise content modification while pre-serving early-stage structural integrity, thus benefiting theerasure community in advancing algorithm designs.2. We propose a trajectory-aware finetuning framework,which encourages the model to reorient its denoising tra-jectories during the mid-to-late stages while keeping theearly-stage trajectories largely unchanged. This approachenables more thorough erasure of unwanted concepts andbetter preservation of unrelated ones.3.

The anchor-based method (MACE), which maps“cat” to “forest”, performs reasonably well in simple contexts butresults in unnatural or incoherent outputs in more complex sce-narios. In contrast, our trajectory-aware method (ANT) effectivelyremoves the target concept while preserving the overall structureand contextual integrity of the generated images.map that precisely identifies the key parameters most re-sponsible for generating the undesired concept, therebyenabling more effective and efficient erasure.4. The proposed objective function substantially enhancesthe performance of existing multi-concept erasure frame-works, achieving SOTA results in both single- and multi-concept erasure settings.2. Related WorkIn this section, we review prior work on concept erasurein diffusion models, with a particular focus on the criti-cal trade-off between erasure and preservation, which ismost pertinent to our study. Additional discussions on otherdimensions of concept erasure (e.g., finetuning efficiency,scalability, and robustness to adversarial prompts) are pro-vided in Appendix.The investigation of concept erasure within diffusionmodels has been pioneered by several foundational stud-ies, establishing the groundwork for this burgeoning do-main. SLD [73] introduces an inference-time guidance tech-nique to suppress undesired concepts without modifyingthe model’s parameters, offering a non-invasive yet effec-tive approach. In contrast, ESD [19] employs direct param-eter editing through negative guidance, achieving perma-nent concept removal. FMN [99] builds upon this trajec-tory by proposing a lightweight method that manipulatesattention mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency.Meanwhile, AC [40] presents a finetuning framework thataligns the score function of an unwanted concept with thatof an anchor concept, delivering an alternative strategy forconcept ablation.As concept erasure techniques have matured, the re-search community has increasingly emphasized the dual ob-jectives of effectively eliminating target concepts while pre-serving the integrity of unrelated concepts during the fine-tuning process. Numerous studies [3, 4, 6–8, 16, 17, 21,22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 37, 39, 48, 52, 55, 57, 58, 72, 74, 80–82, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 95, 102] highlight the necessity ofmaintaining balanced model performance across both tar-geted and non-targeted concepts. However, a critical limita-tion of these approaches lies in their insufficient attention tothe impacts of finetuning on the early-stage score function.This oversight can lead to a divergence between the pre-dicted score function and the true score function, i.e., thegradient direction in data space that maximizes likelihood.As a result, the generated samples may fail to converge to-ward the natural image manifold, ultimately degrading thequality and reliability of the outputs. Our work seeks tobridge this gap by explicitly addressing the preservation ofthe early-stage score function, ensuring both effective con-cept erasure and high-fidelity generation.3. MethodWe propose ANT, a framework designed to erase specificconcepts from pretrained text-to-image diffusion models.Our approach addresses key challenges by eliminating thenegative impacts on early-stage score function fields andremoving the dependency on heuristic methods for anchorconcept selection. The framework requires only two inputs:a pretrained diffusion model and a set of target phrases rep-resenting the concepts to be erased. The output is a fine-tuned model that no longer generates images depicting theunwanted concepts.3.1. Insights into the Denoising ProcessWe thoroughly investigated the denoising process in diffu-sion models and found that applying CFG during the earlysampling stage (when t′ < t < T), and then reversing theCFG’s condition direction term during the mid-to-late sam-pling stage (when 0 < t < t′, as shown in Eq. (1)), allowsfor altering detailed content while preserving the fundamen-tal structure of the image. In other words, the sample avoidsconverging toward specific unwanted concepts yet remains3within the natural image manifold.ϵcfgθ (zt, t, c) = ϵθ(zt, t) + s · sgn(t −t′) · δ(c),(1)sgn(t −t′) =(−1,if t ≤t′1,if t > t′(2)where the terms ϵcfgθ (zt, t, c), ϵθ(zt, t, c), and ϵθ(zt, t) de-note the classifier-free guidance output, the conditional pre-diction, and the unconditional prediction, respectively. Thedifference δ(c) = ϵθ(zt, t, c) −ϵθ(zt, t) defines the con-dition direction. t′ is a key parameter used to determinethe timestep at which the condition direction should be re-versed.As shown in Figure 3(c), if t′ is appropriately selected,this approach allows for the targeted removal of specific at-tributes or details (e.g., occupation, gender, or age) whilepreserving the naturalness of the generated images. This isbecause, during the early stage of denoising, the samplesfollow the correct score function and are guided onto a plau-sible data manifold. In the later stages, the guidance steersthe samples away from certain modes within that manifold.For instance, in Figure 3(c), the occupation changes fromdoctor to model, gender shifts from male to female, andage transitions from both old and young to middle-aged, allwhile staying within the human data manifold.However, if t′ is set too early, the early-stage score func-tion will be significantly altered, leading to a loss of theimage’s structural integrity (see Figure 3(d)). On the otherhand, if t′ is set too late, the samples will have already en-tered the concept-specific mode, and modifications to thelate-stage score function will only affect fine details (seeFigure 3(b)).3.2. Trajectory-Aware Loss FunctionInspired by this finding, we aim to preserve the integrityof the early-stage score function field—which guides sam-ples toward the appropriate natural manifold—by introduc-ing constraints during finetuning. Adjustments will be lim-ited exclusively to the mid-to-late stage score function field.This approach ensures that even when the finetuned modelis conditioned on the removed concept, the samples can stillconverge to the appropriate manifold. Specifically, we pro-pose the following finetuning objective:L = Lpreserve + λ1 · Lerase + λ2 · Luncond-early + λ3 · Luncond-late= Ezt1,c,t1∼U(t′,T )h∥ϵθ(zt1, t1, c) −sg [ϵθ∗(zt1, t1) + ηδ(c)]∥22i+ λ1Ezt2,c,t2∼U(0,t′)h∥ϵθ(zt2, t2, c) −sg [ϵθ∗(zt2, t2) −ηδ(c)]∥22i+ λ2Ezt1,c,t1∼U(t′,T )h∥ϵθ(zt1, t1) −sg [ϵθ∗(z",Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models

With the rise of so-cial media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasinglyspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videosis a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal,audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) weintroduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detectionconsisting of ≈11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2)we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contri-bution of textual and multimodal labels in the classification of sexist andnon-sexist content; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models(LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We findthat visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for bothhumans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however,they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes—instances whereannotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficultyof the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and culturalcontext.1 Warning: This paper contains examples of language and images whichmay be offensive.1IntroductionSexism is a complex phenomenon, generally defined as prejudice or discrimination basedon sex or gender.2 The effects of sexism are systemic (Javidan, 2021), spreading across everysector of society, from the macro-level (social institutions) to the meso-level (social interac-tions) and the micro-level (internalization of sexist beliefs). Studies on sexism conceptualizeit as an ideology (O’Brien, 2009) that reproduces itself by portraying women as naturallyinferior, and by promoting heterosexuality and cisgender identity as normative models. Indoing so, the ideology of sexism marginalizes subjectivities that do not conform to thesenorms, such as intersex and transgender individuals, by portraying them as abnormal.Social networks provide a crucial setting for analyzing the forms and narratives throughwhich sexism spreads and, in doing so, for developing strategies to counter it (Are, 2020;Simpson & Semaan, 2021).

This highlights the critical importance ofanalyzing sexism from a multimodal perspective.The automatic detection of sexism on social platforms is a crucial task because it supportsthe work of human moderators, who have been shown to develop PTSD and depression(Newton, 2020), and helps prevent the spread and normalization of toxic narratives. Itis also a challenging task, particularly when sexism appears in multimodal forms, wheremultiple modalities contribute to the production of discriminatory content. The identifi-cation of sexist content has primarily focused on text, particularly extracting data from X(Rodr´ıguez-S´anchez et al., 2020; Samory et al., 2021; Plaza et al., 2023). Investigating sexismacross multiple modalities is an increasingly relevant topic due to the growing diffusion ofmultimedia content online. The majority of studies in the area of multimodal sexism havefocused on the analysis of memes—images that combine pictorial content with overlaid textadded on top—and the examination of hate speech in videos (Chhabra & Vishwakarma,2023). Previous work on identifying sexism in videos has concentrated on analyzing sexismby sex, primarily targeting women (Arcos & Rosso, 2024), while the analysis of sexism basedon sex (women), sexual orientation, and gender identity (O’Brien, 2009) remains largelyunexplored.In this work, we aim to address the following research questions: Q1: How can we createa systematic annotation framework to analyze the impact of textual, vocal, and visualmodalities in conveying sexist or non-sexist content? Q2: To what extent does visualinformation play a key role in identifying sexism for both humans and models? Q3: Howdo model misclassifications relate to human disagreement? Our work makes the followingcontributions: 1. We introduce MuSeD, a Multimodal Spanish Dataset for Sexism Detection,expanding the definition of sexism to encompass discrimination based on sex, sexualorientation and gender identity. MuSeD includes content that discriminates based on sex,such as portraying women through stereotypes; sexual orientation, by including contentthat discriminates against non-heterosexual identities; and gender identity, by incorporating2Preprint.

Table 1 presents representativeexamples in our dataset. 2. We propose an innovative annotation framework for labelingsexist and non-sexist content, with annotations conducted at different levels: (i) text, (ii)audio, and (iii) video (text, speech, and image), to examine the contribution of visual andmultimodal information to identifying sexist and non-sexist content. This is the first workto examine sexism in multimodal data using such a multi-level annotation scheme. 3. Weevaluate LLMs and multimodal LLMs on sexism detection using text-only and multimodalinputs, analyzing their alignment with human annotations. We find that visual cues help inlabeling sexism, yet models struggle with implicit cases like stereotypes, where annotatoragreement is lower. This highlights the challenge of detecting sexism in multimodal content.2Background and related work2.1Data resources for multimodal sexismImage resourcesCurrently, memes are the most commonly used source of multimodaldatasets for detecting sexism and misogyny against women. The first study that analyzedsexism in memes was conducted by Fersini et al. (2019), who released the MEME dataset,consisting of 800 memes with sexist and non-sexist content. The dataset includes foursubcategories: Shaming, Stereotype, Objectification, and Violence. Misogyny, closely relatedto sexism (Fontanella et al., 2024), is a subtype of hate speech that involves hateful contentagainst women (Zeinert et al., 2021). A significant contribution to the detection of misogyny inmemes came from SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI)(Fersini et al., 2022). The MAMI benchmark dataset includes 10,000 memes for training and1,000 memes for testing, categorized into Shaming, Stereotype, Objectification, and Violence.The MIMIC dataset (Singh et al., 2024) and the MDMD dataset (Ponnusamy et al., 2024)contribute to research on misogyny detection in memes featuring low-resource languages.The EXIST 2024 dataset includes sexist and non-sexist memes in both English and Spanish(Plaza et al., 2024). It contains 2,000 memes per language for the training set and 500 memesper language for the test set.Video resourcesThe development of datasets for detecting sexism in videos is a new andpromising field of investigation. Current research is mostly focused on the detection ofhate speech, a definition that includes the use of discriminative and hateful content againstindividuals or groups based on a broad range of factors, including sexual orientation andgender identity (Chhabra & Vishwakarma, 2023). Das et al. (2023) used BitChute, a platform3Preprint. Under review.primarily used to spread far-right conspiracies and hate speech (Trujillo et al., 2020), forcollecting videos. They released HateMM, a multimodal annotated dataset of 1,083 videos(≈43 hours), 431 labeled as hate and 652 as non-hate. Finally, Arcos & Rosso (2024) usedTikTok to create a dataset in English (≈12 hours) and Spanish (≈14 hours), following theannotation framework developed by Plaza et al. (2023).Limitations of existing datasetsTable 2 compares existing datasets for analyzing sexistand misogynistic content online. We observe that the primary focus of previous work is theanalysis of sexism in memes, considering the relationship between text and image. The keydifferences between our study and previous work are: (i) we broaden the definition of sexismto include discrimination against a target group based on sex, sexual orientation, or genderidentity (O’Brien, 2009), whereas previous work primarily focused on sexism based solelyon sex; (ii) we select two different platforms as data sources: TikTok, a moderated platform,and BitChute, a low-moderation platform, which enables us to find diverse material; (iii)the annotation task is conducted across different modalities to evaluate the impact of eachmodality on identifying sexist content. Furthermore, the task involves selecting segmentsin which annotators identify sexism. This method allows us to precisely identify wheresexism occurs, providing a more accurate annotation; (iv) our annotation team includesa moderator expert on sexism in social media and an expert annotator specializing in theannotation of discriminatory content.2.2Multimodal models for sexism detectionDetecting social biases, including sexism, has traditionally relied on text-based models(Lei et al., 2024), which perform well in detecting explicit biases but struggle with implicitcues, sarcasm, and context-dependent expressions (Ao et al., 2022; Tiwari et al., 2023;S´anchez Villegas et al., 2024; Hee et al., 2024). In contrast, multimodal approaches haveimproved performance in sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection and hate speech detection,especially in cases where gestures, tone, and images shape interpretation (Bagher Zadehet al., 2018; S´anchez Villegas, 2023; Tang et al., 2024; Arya et al., 2024). This is particularlyrelevant in sexism detection, where visual cues can reinforce harmful stereotypes beyondwhat is stated in text (Rizzi et al., 2023). A major challenge in multimodal learning is thereliance on text-based annotations, which fail to account for the distinct contributions oftext, speech, and images (Du et al., 2023; 2024). Building on these insights, we introduceMuSeD, a Multimodal Sexism Detection dataset in Spanish with modality-specific labels,enabling a more granular evaluation of multimodal models.3MuSeD: A dataset for Multimodal Sexism DetectionMuSeD is a Multimodal Sexism Detection dataset in Spanish. We propose an annotationframework to analyze the impact of each modality (text, speech, and image) on identifyingsexist content in videos.3.1Data sourcesTo ensure a balanced dataset that includes sexist and non-sexist content, we collected videosfrom two social media platforms: TikTok and BitChute. In February 2022, TikTok updated itscommunity guidelines to explicitly ban misogyny and misgendering.3 Despite these efforts,forms of denigration against women and people who do not conform to a cisgender identitypersist on the platform in both explicit and implicit ways (Banet-Weiser & Maddocks, 2023).In contrast, BitChute is a low-moderation content platform that makes no effort to preventforms of hate speech, including misogyny. It was launched in 2017 as an alternative to theheavily moderated platform YouTube. The key difference between YouTube and BitChute isthat BitChute does not use a personalized recommendation algorithm. Instead, the platformsuggests popular videos on the front page and related videos while the user watches content.Video selection is determined by the channel owner rather than a recommender system.3https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en4Preprint. Under review.3.2Data collectionThe data was collected between May and October 2024 from TikTok and BitChute. Togather videos from TikTok, we compiled a list of Spanish hashtags. We did not differentiatebetween European and Latin American Spanish and included both varieties. The list ofSpanish hashtags includes 11 from Plaza et al. (2024), which we significantly expand with176 additional hashtags to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation and genderidentity. The original set is focused primarily on sexism against women, including termssuch as #brecha salarial (gender pay gap), #violencia mac","Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sexor gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to re-lationships and individual behavior.

This is because the timestampsof intra-frame events are not well-aligned with the nearbyframes. Similarly, using only inter-frame events also causesa performance drop. Our method, which combines bothintra-frame and inter-frame events, better meets the needsof BVSR, leading to a significant improvement.The RFD module. Tab. 4(c-f, k) shows the importance ofeach component in our RFD module. Removing the CAB,which captures global features from event-image modali-ties, leads to a 0.96 dB drop. Cross-modal (CM) interac-tion is also critical, as its removal causes a 1.15 dB drop.In Tab. 4(e-f), i→e refers to refining event features with im-age features, while e→i represents using event features todeblur image features. While e→i is a standard process inevent-based motion deblurring, i→e is rarely explored. Ex-cluding i→e results in a 0.70 dB drop. Our method employsa sequential i→e followed by e→i, which outperforms re-versing the order, where performance drops by 0.28 dB.Fig. 8 illustrates the deblurring process: in blurry areassuch as railings, the RFD sharpens frame features and en-riches event features with contextual scene information.The HDA module. Tab. 4(g-h, k) shows that our fullmodel, which combines EGA and FGA alignment meth-ods, achieves significant improvements. Fig. 9 visualizes thelearned motion vectors and aligned features. It demonstratesthat DCN offsets, similar to optical flow, capture movingobjects but provide more diversity. Moreover, event-alignedfeatures can capture background areas affected by cameramovement, where flow-aligned features may fail. In con-trast, flow-aligned features enhance details in regions withsignificant motion. These two alignment methods comple-Figure 10: Analysis of the edge-enhanced loss.MetricsMIA-VSRIARTFMA-NetEvTextureOursPSNR↑34.1433.9533.0034.5534.99SSIM↑0.94490.94300.93150.94910.9534LPIPS↓0.16950.17190.18260.16420.1551tOF↓×106.716.867.226.375.98TCC↑×106.035.995.796.146.26Table 5: Comparisons of sharp VSR methods on GoPro.ment each other, and the fused features exhibit sharp edgesand detailed scene representations, validating the effective-ness of our hybrid alignment approach.Edge-enhanced loss. Tab. 4(i-j, k) demonstrates the effec-tiveness of our edge-enhanced loss. Fig. 10 shows that themodel trained with Le more accurately restores windows,eliminating blur and producing sharper edges.Performance on sharp videos. Although our primary fo-cus is on blurry inputs, we compare our method with severalrecent SOTA VSR methods on sharp inputs using the Go-Pro dataset. As shown in Tab. 5, our method consistentlyachieves the best performance on sharp inputs, both in spa-tial recovery and temporal consistency, demonstrating theeffectiveness and versatility of our approach.Limitation.In our setting, we assume that the frame ex-posure time is known and fixed. However, in real-world sce-narios, especially when auto-exposure is enabled, the expo-sure time can vary dynamically depending on the lightingconditions, making it unknown (Kim et al. 2022). Thus, theproblem of handling BVSR under unknown exposure timesremains an open and worthwhile area for further research.5ConclusionThis paper presents Ev-DeblurVSR, a novel event-enhancednetwork for BVSR that leverages high-temporal-resolutionand high-frequency event signals. To effectively fuse frameand event information for BVSR, we categorize eventsinto intra-frame and inter-frame types. The RFD module isthen introduced, utilizing intra-frame events to deblur framefeatures while reciprocally enhancing event features withglobal scene context from frames. Additionally, we proposethe HDA module, which combines the complementary mo-tion information from inter-frame events and optical flow toimprove motion estimation and temporal alignment. Exten-sive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasetsdemonstrate the effectiveness of our Ev-DeblurVSR.6AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge funding from the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China under Grants 62472399 and 62021001.AppendixAMore Visual ResultsIn this section, we provide additional visual comparisons onGoPro, BSD, and NCER datasets.

Introduction1.1. Development of Reconstruction AlgorithmsRadiology involves a series of different tests to capture images of variousparts of the body. A wide range of imaging examinations allows doctors to vi-sualize the bodys interior, including X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, CT scans, andPET scans [1]. Nowadays, radiological imaging modalities such as CT, MRI,and PET have been widely utilized for early disease detection, diagnosis, andtreatment [2]. To convert signals collected by various sensors into images foranalyzing biological processes in cells and tissues, image reconstruction al-gorithms are essential [3]. Among these, three-dimensional reconstructionalgorithms are particularly important. They provide detailed 3D images oforgans, which help detect infections, cancer, trauma, and abnormalities inblood vessels and organs [4].Whats more, 3D reconstruction in radiological imaging research lies atthe intersection of modern applied mathematics, engineering, medicine, ra-diology and computer science [5]. Initially, analysis methods based on con-tinuous representations of the reconstruction problem were applied [6]. Theyusing simple mathematical models to transform images into 3D. For exam-ple, the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) for CT [7] and the Fast FourierTransform (FFT) [8] for MRI [9]. These algorithms are still considered foun-dational models today, as they offer computational efficiency and producehigh-quality images under assumptions of noise-free and fully sampled data[10]. However, these physical-driven approaches typically focus only on thegeometric structure and sampling characteristics of the imaging system [11].They have high computational efficiency but are sensitive to noise, resultingin poor reconstruction quality.To address this, more flexible reconstruction frameworks using IterativeReconstruction (IR) methods were developed [12]. These methods providebetter robustness to noise and incomplete data, though they come at the costof increased computation [13]. As a result, many highly optimized algorithmsincorporating data features have been introduced. One widely used exampleis the Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm [14]in PET imaging [15, 16], which is an accelerated variant of the MaximumLikelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) [17] algorithm that improvesconvergence speed and image quality. It improves convergence speed andcomputational efficiency by dividing the projection data into subsets andupdating the model step by step. However, such traditional algorithms are2often limited in modeling complex anatomical structures and noise patterns,and their performance largely depends on high-quality scan data, which canbe subject to randomness in clinical settings [18].1.2. Advent of Neural NetworksFortunately, in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained signif-icant attention due to its remarkable representational capacity and three-dimensional modeling capabilities [19]. This has led to a surge in researchinterest. Consequently, AI applications in 3D reconstruction for radiologicalimaging are now receiving unprecedented public attention [20, 21].At its inception, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [22] demonstrateda remarkable capacity for complex representation learning [23]. Concurrently,numerous methods began employing CNNs for 3D radiological image recon-struction [24]. Gong et al. integrated a deep residual CNN into an iterativereconstruction framework, enhancing PET image quality by leveraging inter-patient information [25]. However, CNNs exhibit limitations in sensitivityto positional information and struggle to capture global context [26], im-peding their application in medical image reconstruction tasks. Inspired bythe Transformer [27] architecture, the introduction of Vision Transformers(ViT) [28] effectively addresses these challenges, establishing itself as a newbenchmark in the field of medical image analysis [29].However, ViT is primarily designed for feature extraction and faces dif-ficulties when directly applied to reconstruction tasks [30]. Moreover, theself-attention mechanism of ViT imposes high computational demands, es-pecially when processing high-resolution and complex medical images, po-tentially leading to efficiency concerns [30].1.3. Rise of Generative ModelsIn sharp contrast, advancements in generative modeling have offered alter-native solutions in a different domain. One such approach is the VariationalAutoencoder (VAE) [31], which learns a probabilistic latent space to gener-ate new data samples by approximating the data distribution. In parallel,Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [32], first introduced in 2014, utilizeadversarial training between two neural networks to generate realistic datasamples. Their exceptional performance in generation tasks has attractedsignificant attention in 3D reconstruction for radiological imaging [6]. By3combining GAN with CNNs and ViT, Luo et al. proposed the Transformer-GAN framework to reconstruct high-quality standard-dose PET images fromlow-dose PET images with superior performance [33].Despite the robustness of the GAN architecture in enhancing image clar-ity and detail, its inherent instability during training can cause unnaturalartifacts [34]. These inconsistencies can be detrimental to medical imagingapplications.Diffusion models, in contrast, use a noise-based framework,gradually adding noise to data until it becomes random [35]. By learning areverse process to iteratively denoise and recover the original data, new sam-ples are generated in the process. This framework generally exhibits greatertraining stability, making diffusion models a promising new solution for 3Dreconstruction in radiological imaging [36]. For instance, AdaDiff introducesan adaptive diffusion prior for accelerated MRI reconstruction, addressingchallenges posed by domain shifts in imaging operators and MRI image dis-tributions [37].However, diffusion models struggle to account for consistency across dif-ferent viewpoints [38]. Their high computational complexity and challengesin directly generating 3D models often result in suboptimal outcomes for3D medical imaging. Explicit generation methods, such as these, often failto address the lack of internal detail and resolve issues related to viewpointconsistency [39].1.4. Emergence of Novel RepresentationsIn 2020, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) gained significant attention inthe natural image domain for novel view synthesis tasks, making implicitgenerative models a viable solution [40]. For example, MedNeRF combinesNeRF with GAN to reconstruct 3D-aware CT projections from single or few-view X-rays [41]. This network can significantly reduce patient exposure toionizing radiation while maintaining high-fidelity anatomical representationsfor medical applications.While NeRF excels in reconstructing 3D scenes with strong spatial con-sistency, its slow rendering speed makes it unsuitable for real-time imagingin radiological medicine [42]. In 2023, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)framework introduced a explicit radiance field methods for novel view syn-thesis in natural images [43]. This framework achieves high accuracy whileenabling real-time image rendering [44], paving the way for its applicationin medical imaging. For instance, R2-Gaussian is an innovative 3D Gaussiansplatting framework optimized for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction,4effectively addressing integration biases [45]. It achieves superior accuracyand efficiency in volumetric imaging while minimizing computational time.In summary, over the past decades, advancements in artificial intelligencehave significantly impacted the field of 3D reconstruction in radiologicalimaging, leading to a variety of innovative approaches. The developmen-tal roadmap is shown in Fig.1. Thus, it is essential to summarize existingresearch and conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis of methodsin this field, providing a reference for future studies.Figure 1: A brief chronology of the development of techniques related to radiological imagereconstruction in literature.However, existing reviews often focus on specific models or summarizeonly a subset of technologies, frequently overlooking implicit imaging meth-ods [46, 6, 47]. This narrow focus makes it difficult for readers to compre-hensively understand the integration of radiological imaging with computerscience and its technological developments.This review aims to providea comprehensive overview of the application of artificial intelligence in 3Dreconstruction for radiological imaging, encompassing two main categories:explicit reconstruction and implicit reconstruction reconstruction. The differ-ences between these two methods are shown in Fig.2. By collecting relevantliterature from the past five years, this study explores the key challenges andsolutions in the field, offering a reliable reference for researchers. The surveycovers a wide range of radiological imaging modalities, including 3D ultra-sound, CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT. Based on the current key issues in thesestudies, we present a comprehensive summary of existing methodologies. Theprimary contributions of this review are as follows:5• Includes radiological imaging of various anatomical regions and almostall AI-based 3D reconstruction methods in this domain.• From the perspective of integrating computer graphics with medicalscience, the review classifies existing methods based on the morphologyreconstructed into two categories: explicit reconstruction and implicitreconstruction.This is also the first review to incorporate implicitreconstruction methods comprehensively.• The review identifies and summarizes 65 publicly available datasets,representing the largest-scale dataset summary in current reviews.• It proposes future research directions for the field.The remainder of this survey is organized into seven sections.

Methods2.1. Literature ReviewThe research on 3D reconstruction in radiological imaging and artificialintelligence primarily draws from the following databases: Web of Science6[48], Google Scholar [49], and Scopus [50]. The search encompasses publica-tions from the past five years.Initially, the search results are refined using filtering criteria, such as arti-cle type and research field, to narrow the number of results. Next, duplicaterecords are excluded. Subsequently, the records are screened based on theirtitles, abstracts, and the study selection criteria. Studies that cannot be re-trieved are then excluded. Finally, 65 studies that meet the inclusion criteriaare incorporated into the systematic review. Fig.3 illustrates the flowchartof the systematic literature review. The distribution of these studies by yearis depicted in Fig.5(a).In Fig.3, our search keywords include artificial intelligence, deep learning,3D, medical imaging, and imaging reconstruction. Only research articles thatcontain all these keywords are included in our study. we apply three selectioncriteria: 1) Research content filtering: Papers are selected based on their in-trinsic research focus. We rigorously evaluate the relevance of each paper toensure it is representative and relevant to our research scope. 2) Citationcount: We assess the citation count of each paper. Higher citation counts areprioritized, as a higher citation count often reflects greater recognition andimpact within the field. 3) Representative journals or conferences: Priorityis given to papers published in prestigious journals or leading conferences,such as IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (T-MI), Medical Image Anal-ysis (MedIA), The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and PatternRecognition (CVPR), International Conference on Medical Image Comput-ing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) and etc. This criterionguarantees that the selected literature has been subjected to rigorous peerreview, ensuring its credibility.Figure 3: Flowchart of the literature review.72.2. Literature ClassificationThere are multiple feasible classification criteria for studies on radiologicalimage 3D reconstruction [46, 51]. One approach is based on imaging modal-ities, where studies are categorized according to their focus on CT, MRI,PET, SPECT, US, or multimodal imaging, as illustrated in Fig.5(b). An-other classification considers the targeted anatomical regions, distinguishingstudies that focus on brain imaging, breast imaging, or whole-body imaging.A third approach categorizes studies based on reconstruction tasks, whichcan generally be divided into three types, as shown in the Fig.4. Task Iinvolves reconstructing 3D images from raw data, primarily aimed at ac-celerating the imaging process. Task II focuses on transforming low-doseimages into normal-dose images, with the goal of enhancing resolution orreducing artifacts. Task III involves reconstructing images from missingsignals, aiming to restore complete images using limited perspective infor-mation. While these classification schemes offer valuable insights, they doFigure 4: Three distinct types of tasks in radiological image reconstruction.not address methodological considerations from an artificial intelligence per-spective. In the context of 3D representation, reconstruction methods can becategorized as explicit or implicit. Explicit representations use directly ob-servable formats, such as points, volumes, or Gaussian representations whichare inherently discrete.In particular, Gaussian representations integratemaintaining a discrete structure between points while preserving continu-ity within individual points. Implicit representations, in contrast, rely oncontinuous functions, such as neural radiance fields, to model imaging in a8non-intuitive manner.

ARD modifies theteacher transformer architecture by adding token-wise timeembedding to mark each input from the trajectory historyand employs a block-wise causal attention mask for train-ing. Furthermore, incorporating historical inputs only inlower transformer layers enhances performance and effi-ciency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a class-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis. Ourmodel achieves a 5× reduction in FID degradation com-pared to the baseline methods while requiring only 1.1%extra FLOPs on ImageNet-256. Moreover, ARD reachesFID of 1.84 on ImageNet-256 in merely 4 steps and outper-forms the publicly available 1024p text-to-image distilledmodels in prompt adherence score with a minimal dropin FID compared to the teacher.

IntroductionDiffusion models currently dominate image synthesis land-scape due to their striking generalization capabilities andunprecedented visual quality [8, 12, 56, 61]. Unlike gener-ative adversarial networks (GANs) [16], the stable trainingof DMs facilitates their expansion to high-resolution imagegeneration.Recently, models based on Diffusion Trans-formers (DiT) [54] architecture gained significant popu-larity due to their excellent scaling properties and abilityto generate high-resolution images [5, 6]. However, sam-pling from DMs requires repeated neural network evalua-tions [44], which makes the high-resolution image synthesisslow and resource-intensive.DMs generate samples by solving the denoising processnumerically. The denoising process has a probability flowordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation [69, 71],which provides deterministic coupling between noise andsamples. To reduce sampling costs, a series of distillationmodels [17, 27, 42, 45, 62, 72, 86] have been developed thatlearn to predict ODE solution with fewer steps. However,few-step student models suffer from exposure bias [53, 57]because the student’s intermediate prediction often deviatesfrom the teacher’s ODE due to estimation errors. The errorsaccumulate during iterative sampling, causing the predic-tion to become more erroneous as we approach a solution.To address exposure bias in few-step distillation models,we propose an AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD) methodfor diffusion transformers. ARD predicts the next samplexτs−1 based on both the current estimate xτs and the en-tire historical trajectory, which is more informative. Thisapproach offers two benefits: it reduces accumulated errorsand provides a better source of coarse-grained informationwhich is contained in the historical trajectory. Incorporat-ing the historical trajectory in the lower layers further in-troduces an inductive bias to handle coarse-grained infor-mation. We find that when distilling based on the wholehistorical trajectory, the FID degradation from the teacheris five times lower than that of the baselines on ImageNet256p, with only 1.1% more computation required. Our ap-proach also scales well and can be used to distill 1024p text-to-image diffusion transformers, which outperform publicdistillation approaches in text-image alignment metrics.2. Preliminary2.1. Diffusion modelsDiffusion models define a forward process and a corre-sponding reverse process with Stochastic Differential Equa-tions (SDEs). The forward process in Eq. (1) maps from thedata x0 ∼pdata(x0) to a noise xT . d \ rvx _ t = \ mathbf {f}(\rvx _t,t)dt + g(t)d\mathbf {w}_t,\label {eq:fwd}(1)where f : Rd × [0, T] →R is a drift term, g : [0, T] →R isa diffusion term, and wt is a Wiener process. The forwardprocess is often set to variance-preserving [22] or variance-exploding [71] SDEs to closely resemble a Gaussian distri-bution at t = T. Diffusion models generate the data fromthe noise xT ∼pprior(xT ) through a reverse process [1, 71].There exists a probability flow ODE (PF-ODE), which is adeterministic counterpart of the reverse process: d \ rvx _t = [\mathbf { f}( \rvx _t,t)-\frac {1}{2}g(t)^2\nabla _{\rvx _t}\log {p_t(\rvx _t)}]dt.\label {eq:bwd}(2)Here pt(xt) is the marginal distribution defined by the for-ward process in Eq. (1). PF-ODE has the same marginal dis-tribution as the reverse SDE while providing deterministiccoupling between the noise xT and the sample x0. Since thescore function ∇xt log pt(xt) is intractable, it is estimatedby a neural network ∇xt log pt(xt) ≈∇xt log pϕt (xt) witha score matching objective [70, 79].2.2. Step distillation modelsThe solution of an ODE in Eq. (2) is obtained by xT +R 0Tdxtdt dt; however, it requires a sufficient number of stepsto reduce discretization error [9, 44].In order to com-pute dxtdt at each step, we need to evaluate the learned neu-ral score function ∇xt log pϕ∗t (xt), leading to high com-putational costs.

M2 and M3 are intermediate options between M1 and M4.with S as the total number of student steps and s ∈{0, 1, . . . , S}. These intermediate times define a trajectoryµϕ∗:= [xτS, xτS−1, . . . , xτ1, xτ0] within the teacher ODEstarting from an initial noise xτS = xT and ending with aclean sample xτ0 = x0. The student model learns a jointprobability p(µϕ∗) defined as: p(\b o ldsymbol {\ mu}_{\boldsymbol {\phi ^{*}}})= p_{\text {prior}}(\rvx _{\tau _{S}}) \times \prod _{s=1}^{S} p(\rvx _{\tau _{s-1}}|\rvx _{\tau _{s}}) \label {eq:step}(3)By the deterministic nature of PF-ODE, each conditionalprobability p(xτs−1|xτs) is a Dirac delta distribution, soit can be modeled by the deterministic mapping func-tion; xτs−1 = G(xτs, s) := xτs +R τs−1τsdxtdt dt.Thestudent model Gθ(xτs, s) ≈G(xτs, s) learns to mimicthe ground truth ODE integrations.Progressive distilla-tion [51, 62] proposes a progressive algorithm for step dis-tillation. However, such algorithm suffers from a signifi-cant drawback: the accumulation of errors during its itera-tive training phases when the student becomes the teacheragain. Training a few-step student model directly from theteacher using Lstep mitigates the accumulated errors broughtthe iterative progressive distillation procedure. We build ourmethod on top of step distillation, where we directly learn-ing from the teacher: \ma th cal { L}_{\text {ste p} } :=\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol {\mu }_{\boldsymbol {\phi ^{*}}}}\left [ \sum _{s=1}^{S}||G_{\boldsymbol {\theta }}(\rvx _{\tau _{s}},s) - \rvx _{\tau _{s-1}}||_2^2\right ]. \label {eq:step_loss}(4)Exposure biasDuring inference, the generation startsfrom xτS ∼pprior(xτS). At each step, the student modelpredicts ˆxτs−1 = Gθ(ˆxτs, s) based only on the current sam-ple ˆxτs. If ˆxτs deviates from the teacher ODE, the studentmodel Gθ infers based on an unseen sample that was notencountered during training.Consider, for example, theintermediate samples depicted in Fig. 2a, where a fish isshown without eyes, despite such samples did not appear inthe training data. This unforeseen input propagates throughthe sampling process, culminating in a final sample xτ0 thatalso lacks eyes. This exposure bias is an inherent limita-tion of the iterative procedure [53, 57], unless perfect opti-mization is achieved. The errors accumulate as the iterativesampling process progresses.2.3. Autoregressive modelsAutoregressive models [32] represent the joint probabil-ity distribution of a multivariate random variable x :=[xS, xS−1, . . . , x0] by decomposing it into a product of con-ditional probabilities p(x) = p(xS) × QSs=1 p(xs−1|xS:s),where xS:s = [xS, xS−1, . . . , xs]. This formulation, as de-picted above, does not rely on any specific assumptions.Each component p(xs−1|xS:s) of the decomposition incor-porates the information of all preceding variables.3. MethodIn this section we introduce the AutoRegressive Distillation(ARD) of diffusion transformers (DiT). Figure 2b providesan overview of the ARD process. We’ll break down theprobabilistic formulations of distillation in Section 3.1, thenmove on to the transformer architecture design for our stu-dent model in Section 3.2. Lastly, we’ll cover training andinference in Section 3.3.3.1. Autoregressive distillationThis section generalizes the step distillation formulation inEq. (3) to ARD. The decomposition in Eq. (3) is valid with-out whole historical trajectory information under perfect3× (𝐿−𝑁)(a) Using historical trajectory in N layers.(b) N = 28 / Query: x0.75T(c) N = 6 / Query: x0.75T(d) N = 28 / Query: x0.5T(e) N = 6 / Query: x0.5T(f) N = 28 / Query: x0.25T(g) N = 6 / Query: x0.25TFigure 4. (a) shows an additional inductive bias that we impose by using the historical trajectory in lower layers only. (b, d, f) show theattention scores for each history input (key tokens) during the 2nd, 3rd, 4th steps when N = L. (c, e, g) show the same but with N = 6.The attention score on input xτs′ is the sum of attention weights for all key tokens in xτs′ , indicating the portion of xτs′ .distillation. However, when each probability p(xτs−1|xτs)is approximated by ˆxτs−1 = Gθ(xτs, s), the discrepancywith the ground truth is inevitable due to estimation error,leading to the exposure bias problem discussed in Sec. 2.2.To mitigate this problem, we extend the formulation ofEq. (3) in an autoregressive manner motivated by Sec. 2.3: p(\b o ldsymbol {\ mu}_{\boldsymbol {\phi }^{*}})= p_{\text {prior}}(\rvx _{\tau _{S}}) \times \prod _{s=1}^{S} p(\rvx _{\tau _{s-1}}|\rvx _{\tau _{S}:\tau _{s}}), \label {eq:ours}(5)where xτS:τs = [xτS, xτS−1, . . . , xτs] denotes the histori-cal trajectory. This formulation has two benefits: (i) Ev-ery step includes the ground truth initial noise xτS as input,which has a deterministic coupling with the prediction tar-get xτs−1. Furthermore, the historical trajectory predictionsfrom ˆxτS−1 to ˆxτs+1 are more accurate compared to the re-cent sample ˆxτs because for them the error had less chancesto accumulate during inference. In contrast, the input inEq. (3) is merely the current sample ˆxτs, making it vulner-able to exposure bias. (ii) To predict xτs−1 at every step,the model needs to generate both coarse-grained and fine-grained information. The recent denoised sample xτs is thebest source for fine-grained information, but the historicaltrajectory close to xτS is a better source for coarse-grainedinformation [13, 60].For the modified student formulation, we aim to estimatep(xτs−1|xτS:τs), which is still a Dirac delta distribution. Toachieve this we define a new mapping function xτs−1 =G(xτS:τs, s) := xτs +R τs−1τsdxtdt dt. This function is thenapproximated by a student neural network Gθ(xτS:τs, s).3.2. Transformer designThe design of our mapping function Gθ(xτS:τs, s) definedin Sec. 3.1 is not trivial because the input size varies depend-ing on the denoising step s. To overcome this, we modifythe teacher DiT backbone to accommodate multiple inputs.ArchitectureTo handle the historical trajectory, we de-sign transformer-based autoregressive model as shown inFig. 3a. Each input xτs is tokenized into a sequence oftokens using a shared patch embedder. Since each inputxτs has the same spatial structure as a 2D grid, positionalembeddings are shared across the inputs. The transformerblocks need to identify the order of each token in the in-puts sequence xτS, . . . , xτs. To this end, we add an ex-tra time-step embeddings to each token similar to the levelembedding in VAR [76].1 The recent denoised sample xτsbecomes the query tokens, and the history sequence xτS:τsbecomes the key-value tokens in the self-attention blocks.After passing through L stacked transformer blocks, the to-kens are linearly transformed and de-tokenized to obtain asample xτs−1.Historical trajectory only in lower N layers.Fig-ures 4b, 4d and 4f show the attention scores of each inputin (2nd, 3rd, 4th) steps at each L transformer layers. The re-cent denoised sample xτs is most activated as key tokensin the higher layers, while the historical trajectory xτS:τs+1is activated in the lower layers. The lower layers in DiTblocks are known to consider coarse-grained information,while the higher layers in DiT blocks are considered fine-grained information [19]. This attention portion validatesthat the historical trajectory is useful and serves as a bet-ter source of coarse-grained information. However, the his-1The original DiT backbone uses time embedding with adaLN [55] be-cause the tokens in the DiT teacher are always from the same input, so itdoes not need to identify time on a token-wise basis. On the other hand,our student model needs to be modified to identify the origin of each token.4torical tokens still slightly fluctuate in the higher layers inFigs. 4b, 4d and 4f, possibly due to imperfect optimization.We propose additional design choices in transformer layersas shown in Fig. 4a; using the historical trajectory only inthe lower N layers. This inductive bias enhances the useof the historical trajectory in the lower layers as shown inFigs. 4c, 4e and 4g.3.3. Training and inference procedureThe default training objective of ARD is a regression lossLARD in Eq. (6), and it is optimized with respect to θ.The transformer architecture in Fig. 3a allows computingˆxτs−1 = Gθ(xτS:τs, s) for all s ∈{1, . . . , S} simultane-ously by using an attention mask. We can generalize ourframework by designing the attention mask as shown inFig. 3b. Block-wise causal attention in option M4 is themost flexible, as it uses the entire trajectory history. OptionM1 represents step distillation, which only uses the currentsample xτs as input. Options M2 and M3","Diffusion models with transformer architectures havedemonstrated promising capabilities in generating high-fidelity images and scalability for high resolution.

Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges inisolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguityor robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiplefactors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguityand Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complexand realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, includingambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agentapproach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer overmultiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses correspond-ing to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise,thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source modelson AmbigDocs – which requires presenting all valid answers for ambigu-ous queries – improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40%, andon FaithEval – which requires suppressing misinformation – where weimprove by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Further-more, we find that our proposed RAMDocs dataset poses a challenge forexisting RAG baselines (the most performant Llama3.3-70B-Instruct onlyyields up to a 32.60 exact match score), as it requires handling conflictinginformation due to ambiguity, noise, and misinformation simultaneously.While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analy-sis indicates that a substantial gap remains, especially when increasing thelevel of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.11IntroductionRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generatemore accurate and reliable responses by incorporating retrieved external information (Lewiset al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), mitigating issues such as hallucination (Zhanget al., 2023) and outdated parametric knowledge (Kasai et al., 2023). Indeed, recent LLMinterfaces and AI-powered search engines, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024), Claude (An-thropic, 2025), Google Search with AI Overviews (Google, 2024b), and Microsoft Bing Chat(Microsoft, 2024), have integrated retrieval capabilities that enable them to access vastamounts of information from the internet, allowing them to summarize search results andprovide more accurate and up-to-date answers. This kind of RAG also features promi-nently in “deep research” techniques that frame search as an agent-driven process in whicha research agent collects and summarizes online sources (Google, 2024a; OpenAI, 2025).However, a core challenge faced by all of these approaches is that information retrievedfrom the internet can be conflicting, noisy, and unreliable – retrieved documents might contain1Our data and code is publicly available at: https://github.com/HanNight/RAMDocs.1arXiv:2504.13079v1 [cs.CL] 17 Apr 2025Retrieved Documents Document 3 states Jordan was born in 1998.

Conflict may occur because of ambiguity in the query (inthis case, different referents for Michael Jordan), but also because of misinformation fromincorrect documents and noise from irrelevant ones. MADAM-RAG (right) addresses thisthrough multi-agent debate, where each agent summarizes and represents the informationin one document. Agents discuss their responses across multiple rounds, with the finalanswers being combined via an aggregator module that summarizes the discussion.misinformation, unverified claims, and AI-generated content that may be inaccurate ormisleading (Pan et al., 2023b; Augenstein et al., 2023). Moreover, queries themselves maybe ambiguous and underspecified, leading to the retrieval of conflicting yet factually accurateinformation from different sources (Wan et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024).In practice, different kinds of conflict will occur within the same system, each with adifferent expected behavior. For instance, conflict due to an ambiguous query ought tobe treated differently from conflict due to noisy or incorrect documents. As illustrated inFigure 1, a model should present multiple valid answers for an ambiguous query (i.e., conflict indocuments 1 and 2), but should filter out misinformation and noise (i.e., the conflict introducedby documents 3 and 4). Existing datasets generally capture only one aspect of conflict inretrieved documents: e.g., AmbigDocs (Lee et al., 2024) focuses on ambiguous queries,while FaithEval (Ming et al., 2024) assesses an LLM’s ability to handle conflict due tomisinformation or noise. Similarly, approaches to improve robustness of RAG systemsfocus primarily on improving the retrieved content by filtering out incorrect, irrelevant oreven malicious information, e.g., due to conflicts with parametric knowledge (Wang et al.,2024a; Jin et al., 2024) or poisoning attacks (Weller et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025). However,approaches designed to choose only one correct answer may fail to generalize to settingslike ambiguity, where conflict is expected and multiple valid answers exist, e.g., when thereis legitimate uncertainty in the retrieved documents or ambiguity in the query (Lee et al.,2024; Wan et al., 2024). Therefore, as illustrated in Figure 1, RAG systems need to balancethe tradeoff between presenting conflicting information (to disambiguate a user query withmultiple valid answers) while also selectively filtering out misinformation and noise.To address this tradeoff,we introduce Multi-agent Debate for Ambiguity andMisinformation in RAG (MADAM-RAG), a unified multi-agent approach designed to handlemultiple diverse cases of information conflict, with different expected behaviors dependingon the source of conflict. In case of ambiguous queries, MADAM-RAG can opt to show multi-ple responses while also removing misinformation or noise. While prior work processes andfilters retrieved documents collectively (Wang et al., 2024a; Weller et al., 2024), our approachassigns each document to an independent agent (instantiated from the same LLM), whichgenerates an intermediate response based solely on its input document. Next, these multipleagents debate over the merits and evidence backing their intermediate responses, iterativelyupdating their answers across a dialogue. For instance, in Figure 1 (right), the multi-agentinteraction reveals that documents 1 and 2 refer to two different people, i.e., a basketballplayer and a professor, thus rightfully corresponding to two different answers, one for eachdisambiguated entity. At the same time, the debate can uncover that documents 3 and 4also refer to the same basketball player and are unreliable when compared to document 1.2Finally, the discussion is summarized by an aggregator module that synthesizes a coherentfinal response from the agent discussions (cf. Figure 1).In addition to evaluating MADAM-RAG against strong RAG baselines on existing datasetslike FaithEval (Ming et al., 2024) and AmbigDocs (Lee et al., 2024) that measure one sourceof conflict (i.e., due to misinformation or due to ambiguity, etc.), we introduce RAMDocs, aunified dataset that combines multiple sources of conflict corresponding to a single query,covering ambiguity, noise from unrelated documents, and misinformation. Built on top ofAmbigDocs, RAMDocs retains disambiguated queries and answers, and augments themwith misinformation documents (created by replacing correct entities with plausible butincorrect ones) and noisy documents (retrieved passages that are topically irrelevant to thequery) which is likely to occur in real-world retrieval settings. Unlike prior datasets (Leeet al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024) that assume a uniform distribution of supporting documents,we also introduce cases where different answers have uneven document support, testinghow model outputs change across varying ratios of representation for each perspective.Empirically, across three LLMs: Llama3.3-70B-Inst (Llama Team, 2024), Qwen2.5-72B-Inst (Qwen et al., 2025) and GPT-4o-mini (Hurst et al., 2024), we show that MADAM-RAGoutperforms Astute-RAG (Wang et al., 2024a), which iteratively clusters and combinesretrieved documents while filtering misinformation, by 11.40% (absolute accuracy) onAmbigDocs (measuring the model’s ability to handle ambiguous queries) with Llama3.3-70B-Inst and by 13.10% on FaithEval (measuring robustness to misinformation) when usingQwen2.5-72B-Inst. Furthermore, when compared to relying solely on the LLM’s parametricknowledge and the standard RAG pipeline which concatenates all retrieved documentsinto the model’s context, we demonstrate that MADAM-RAG beats the parametric knowl-edge baseline by 7.50% on FaithEval, and the concatenated prompt baseline by 11.50% onAmbigDocs with GPT-4o-mini. Additionally, our ablations with Llama3.3-70B-Inst verifythe salience of MADAM-RAG’s aggregator and multi-round discussion, with accuracy im-provements of 19% and 5.30% on FaithEval. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of RAMDocs,which tests on ambiguity, noise, and misinformation together, finding that all baselinesdegrade in performance as we increase the imbalance in supporting documents per answer.While MADAM-RAG helps mitigate these drops in performance, there remains large roomfor improvement on RAMDocs which we introduce as a challenge for future work.2Related WorkRetrieval-Augmented Generation.Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emergedas a crucial technique for enhancing the generative capabilities of language models viaintegrating external knowledge retrieval instead of solely relying on parametric knowl-edge (Lewis et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021). Variants such as REALM(Guu et al., 2020), Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) (Izacard & Grave, 2021), and RETRO (Borgeaudet al., 2022) have further optimized retrieval methods and document encoding strategiesto enhance efficiency and scalability. However, these do not fully address the critical chal-lenge of handling conflicting information across multiple retrieved documents. Prior work,such as Chen et al. (2022); Zou et al. (2024), has shown that RAG systems often propagatemisinformation if retrieved documents contain errors, or arbitrarily choose an answer oruse parametric knowledge to break ties when documents provide conflicting claims. Unlikeexisting solutions like SELF-RAG (Asai et al., 2024) that use LLM-generated critiques andAstute RAG (Wang et al., 2024a) that uses the LLM’s parametric knowledge and clustering tocombine retrieved documents and filter outliers or misinformation, MADAM-RAG employsmulti-agent debate over several rounds, wherein each agent gets the opportunity to reviseits response as well as influence other agents in each round. Moreover, in contrast to Changet al. (2024), who use a multi-agent framework solely for scoring and filtering out noisy doc-uments, our multi-agent approach also handles other scenarios with conflicting evidence bysuppressing misinformation and presenting multiple valid answers for ambiguous queries.RAG Evaluation Benchmarks.Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate RAGsystems under various conditions. AmbigNQ (Min et al., 2020) and AmbigDocs (Lee et al.,2024) datasets assess the ability to handle questions with multiple valid answers, with the3latter extending information about ambiguous entities across multiple documents, leadingus to test on AmbigDocs. However, these datasets do not consider noise or misinformation.On the other hand, the RGB dataset (Chen et al., 2024) introduces retrieval noise, testinghow well models respond to partially relevant content in the retrieved documents. HAGRID(Kamalloo et al., 2023) focuses on attribution in generative QA, while CRAG (Yang et al.,2024) presents a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse question types across fivedomains, varying in entity popularity and temporal sensitivity. Note that each of thesedatasets assumes that a given question has a single correct answer and thus they do notaddress scenarios with multiple conflicting yet valid answers, which our work explicitlytargets. We unify these separate lines of work by introducing RAMDocs that includesmultiple valid answers for each query (due to ambiguity) as well as uneven numbers ofsupporting documents and conflicting evidence from misinformed and noisy documents.Knowledge Conflict in LLMs.Recent studies have highlighted the challenge of knowl-edge conflict in LLMs, where inconsistent or conflicting information may arise from eitherinternal parametric memory or retrieved external context. A comprehensive survey by Xuet al. (2024b) categorizes knowledge conflicts into intra-context, inter-context, and paramet-ric conflicts, and outlines the limitations of current methods in resolving them. While priorwork has made strides in addressing parametric and single-document conflicts (Gao et al.,2023; Wang et al., 2024b), recent studies highlight the difficulty of resolving disagreementsacross multiple contexts or retrieved documents (Chen et al., 2022; Su et al., 2024). Suchinter-context conflict can stem from misinformation (Pan et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2023) oroutdated knowledge (Kasai et al., 2023), and has been shown to impair factual accuracy (Jinet al., 2024). Our MADAM-RAG approach addresses this gap by modeling each documentby a separate LLM agent, using multi-agent debate to identify potential ambiguity and ag-gregating multiple valid answers while also suppressing and resolving conflicting evidencestemming from misinformation and noisy retrieval.3RAMDocs: Retrieval with Ambiguity & Misinformation in DocumentsMeasuring the performance of RAG systems in real-world settings requires assessing eachsystem’s ability to cope with conflicting information.
