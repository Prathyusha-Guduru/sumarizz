"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING FACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OFLARGE LANGUAGE MODELSXuming Hu1,2*, Junzhe Chen1*, Xiaochuan Li1*, Yufei Guo1, Lijie Wen1†,Philip S. Yu3, Zhijiang Guo4†1 Tsinghua University2 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)3 University of Illinois at Chicago4 University of Cambridgexuminghu@hkust-gz.edu.cn, wenlj@tsinghua.edu.cn, zg283@cam.ac.ukABSTRACTLarge language models (LLMs) have recently driven striking performance im-provements across a range of natural language processing tasks. The factualknowledge acquired during pretraining and instruction tuning can be useful invarious downstream tasks, such as question answering, and language generation.Unlike conventional Knowledge Bases (KBs) that explicitly store factual knowl-edge, LLMs implicitly store facts in their parameters. Content generated by theLLMs can often exhibit inaccuracies or deviations from the truth, due to facts thatcan be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. To this end, we aim toexplore the extent and scope of factual knowledge within LLMs by designing thebenchmark Pinocchio. Pinocchio contains 20K diverse factual questions that spandifferent sources, timelines, domains, regions, and languages. Furthermore, weinvestigate whether LLMs can compose multiple facts, update factual knowledgetemporally, reason over multiple pieces of facts, identify subtle factual differences,and resist adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on different sizes and typesof LLMs show that existing LLMs still lack factual knowledge and suffer fromvarious spurious correlations. We believe this is a critical bottleneck for realizingtrustworthy artificial intelligence. The dataset Pinocchio and our codes are publiclyavailable at: https://github.com/THU-BPM/Pinocchio.1INTRODUCTIONLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in recentyears since they have significantly improved performance on various downstream tasks (Brown et al.,2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; OpenAI, 2022; 2023).Prior efforts have shown that language models can store factual knowledge and act as knowledgebases (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020c). Factual knowledge in language models acquiredduring pretraining can benefit knowledge-intensive downstream tasks such as question answering andfact checking (Roberts et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2023a; Pan et al., 2023).Despite advancements in LLMs, they still struggle with generating content that exhibits inaccuraciesor deviations from the facts and making reasoning errors (Lin et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023).These factual errors can be difficult to identify since LLMs implicitly memorize facts through theirparameters rather than explicitly store factual knowledge as traditional Knowledge Bases. Accessingand interpreting the computations and memories of these models can be challenging (Ribeiro et al.,2016; Belinkov & Glass, 2019), especially when APIs are the only means of interaction and manyinterpretation methods rely on weights and representations (Cao et al., 2021b). The presence of errorsin stored factual knowledge or the incorrect induction and obsolescence of certain facts over timemay be contributing factors to this limitation, which in turn affects the performance of LLMs (Elazaret al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021a). This limitation restricts the application of LLMs in some high-stakesareas, such as healthcare, finance, and law (Dong et al., 2022). Hence, exploring the degree to whichLLMs hold factual information and their ability to reason with such knowledge is vital.∗Equal Contribution.† Corresponding authors.1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 1: Pinocchio is a comprehensive dataset that tackles 7 distinct tasks related to factual knowl-edge and reasoning. It consists of 20,713 multiple-choice questions that have been sourced fromvarious reliable and diverse channels.To this end, we propose the Pinocchio, a testbed aimed at understanding factuality and reasoningfor LLMs. It contains 20K diverse factual questions that span different sources, timelines, domains,regions, and languages. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs are able to recognize thecombination of multiple facts, reason over structured and unstructured evidence, realize facts changeover time, identify subtle factual differences, and resist adversarial examples based on the dataset.We control for problem difficulty in each distinct reasoning task to enable fine-grained analysis.With the Pinocchio benchmark, we explore whether various LLMs (Scao et al., 2022b; Zhang et al.,2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a; Chiang et al., 2023) couldstore factual knowledge and perform reasoning based on it. We envision Pinocchio as a suite ofbenchmarks, subsets of which could be separately utilized to assess certain model abilities of interestand analyze important strengths and limitations of LLMs. For instance, in temporal tasks, we find thatLLMs lack factual knowledge for up-to-date questions; in complex factual tasks that require multi-hopreasoning, LLMs still have limitations, even when various prompting strategies are employed. Wehope Pinocchio can serve as the initial step towards understanding the abilities of LLMs from multipledimensions and facilitate the development of LLMs.2DATASET CONSTRUCTION2.1TASKSAiming to systematically evaluate the factual knowledge and related reasoning abilities of LLMs,we raise seven research questions, then carefully select factual statements from different sourcessummarized in Table 1.• Task 1: Multifaceted Previous research (Petroni et al., 2019) has shown that small languagemodels like BERT have the ability to retain relational knowledge from training data and answer“fill-in-the-blank” cloze statements. This raises the question of whether LLMs can also storeand reason over multiple pieces of facts obtained during pretraining. It is not just importantfor LLMs to memorize individual facts accurately, but to also recognize and generate newcombinations of facts from different sources. To investigate this issue, we have selected claimsfrom the FEVER dataset (Thorne et al., 2018), which were written by human annotators basedon information from Wikipedia articles. These claims are either supported or refuted by multiplefacts from (the same or several) Wikipedia articles, or there is insufficient information availableto verify them. To assess the performance of language models in handling various combinationsof facts, we have sampled statements that require different numbers of evidence, ranging fromone to many, enabling fine-grained analysis.• Task 2: Structural In addition to unstructured text, factual knowledge is also commonly storedin a structured format, such as tables, lists, or databases (Bhagavatula et al., 2013). However,2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Table 1: Pinocchio Dataset Sources, Descriptions, and Data Distribution.DomainDescriptionSourcesDistributionFact.Non-Fact.NEIALLMultifacetedContain multiple factsFEVER1,1111,1111,1103,332StructuralContain structured and unstructured factsFEVEROUS1,7411,9532503,944AdversarialContain facts edited by adversarial methodsSymmetric, FM2815921-1,736TemporalContain facts that change over timeVitaminC1,8981,0433553,296Real-WorldContain factual statements spread onlinePolitiFact9861,9876093,582Domain-SpecificContain facts from health and science domainsPubHealth, SciFact1,1567157372,608Multi-LingualContain facts in different languagesXFact, CHEF8208485472,215current LLMs are primarily trained on unstructured text using next word prediction loss (Brownet al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a). In order to process structured data, it is often convertedinto text strings using various methods, such as linearizing tables. This raises the question ofwhether LLMs are capable of effectively memorizing and reasoning over facts from structuredsources, similar to their performance with unstructured text. To investigate this question, wesample factual statements from the FEVEROUS dataset (Aly et al., 2021), which is constructedin a similar manner to FEVER but includes evidence in the form of tables, sentences, or both.• Task 3: Adversarial Language models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples thatare strategically modified to deceive even advanced models with hardly noticeable changes (Shenet al., 2023). Given this knowledge, it is important to examine whether LLMs can withstand ad-versarial examples in the context of factuality. To investigate this, we utilize two datasets, namelySymmetric (Schuster et al., 2019) and FM2 (Eisenschlos et al., 2021). These datasets consistof adversarial examples that have been crafted using various strategies, including temporalinference and diverting to unrelated facts.• Task 4: Temporal Facts are not static but rather possess a dynamic nature. With the vast amountof new information constantly emerging, facts often undergo changes, additions, or alterations.It raises the question of whether LLMs are able to adapt to these factual changes over time. Inparticular, we wonder if LLMs are capable of discerning factual knowledge from different timeperiods, since the pretraining corpus may not be processed and organized chronologically. Toexplore this, we utilize the VitaminC (Schuster et al., 2021) dataset, which consists of claimsbased on modifications made to factual content in Wikipedia articles. Claims can be eitherrefuted by outdated facts or supported by updated facts.• Task 5: Real-World In contrast to other tasks that assume Wikipedia has all the essential factualinformation, verifying viral claims on the internet often requires not only factual knowledgefrom various sources but also common sense and worldly knowledge. An important query wehave is whether LLMs can effectively integrate diverse types and sources of knowledge acquiredduring training. To address this, we select claims from the FactCheck (Misra, 2022) dataset,which consists of claims spread over the Internet and subsequently verified by journalists.• Task 6: Domain-Specific In addition to the tasks mentioned earlier, which primarily focus onfactual knowledge in general domains, we are also interested in exploring how LLMs possess thecapability to access domain-specific factual knowledge. The domain-specific setting presentsunique challenges. Take the science domain as an example, LLMs need to acquire backgroundknowledge, handle quantitative reasoning, and comprehend specialized statistical language. Toinvestigate this further, we sample claims from PubHealth (Kotonya & Toni, 2020) in the publichealth domain and SciFact (Wadden et al., 2022) in the science domain.• Task 7: Multi-Lingual Existing LLMs are mainly trained on English corpus because of theirabundance and quality (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a). However, the scarcity oftraining data in other languages raises the question of whether LLMs can transfer the factualknowledge acquired in English to other languages. To investigate this, we collected claims fromvarious languages including French, Chinese, and more, using the XFACT dataset (Gupta &Srikumar, 2021) and the CHEF dataset (Hu et al., 2022b) in a total of 27 different languages.2.2ANNOTATION AND QUALITY CONTROLMultiple-choice questions offer a practical approach to assess the complex capabilities of LLMs, ofwhich GPT-4 is a prime example (OpenAI, 2023). Key benchmarks such as MMLU (Hendryckset al., 2021b), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), ARC (Clark et al., 2018a), and TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,2022), all of which utilize multi-choice formats, serve distinct purposes in evaluating various aspectsof GPT-4’s proficiency. Specifically, the MMLU gauges an LLM’s knowledge breadth and depth.3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Zero-shot    You will be presented with a question.             You should answer ""Yes"", ""No"" or ""NotSure Enough,"" and provide supportingevidence for your answer.    Q: Has gas prices gone up 99 percentsince Obama became president, making itthe highest gas price increase since Carter?    A:Few-shot with CoT   You will be presented with a question.    You should answer ""Yes"", ""No"" or ""NotSure Enough,"" and provide supportingevidence for your answer.Here are some examples:    Q:  Is there a capital called Mogadishu?    A: Mogadishu is a city in East Africa,specifically in Somalia.

TruthfulQAmeasures how LLMs mimic human falsehoods. Furthermore, the evaluation of language generationbrings its own set of challenges, as a universal metric for measurement is currently lacking (Sai et al.,2023), which multiple-choice questions help to mitigate by offering straightforward classificationaccuracy for assessment (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). Also, prior studies (Kadavath et al., 2022)underscore that LLMs demonstrate reliable calibration on multiple-choice scenarios. Therefore, wealso used the multi-choice questions as a simple but good proxy to evaluate the abilities of LLMs.For data annotation, we hired 10 undergraduate students, all with good English proficiency. We askedthe students to rewrite the original claims into questions without distorting factuality while providingfactuality labels for the questions. By transforming declarative statements into questions, using aQuestion-Answering approach can more effectively elicit factual knowledge from LLMs (Kadavathet al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022), and we also illustrate through experiments in Sec. 4.2. Note that claimsin the original datasets are usually labeled based on given evidence, e.g. evidence supports or refutesthe claim, but in Pinocchio, we only need to judge the factuality of the question. So we use unifiedlabels: Yes, No, Not Sure Enough. The three labels correspond respectively to Factual, Non-Factual,and Not Enough Information for factual questions. Considering that all fact-checking datasets use athree-label system (Guo et al., 2022), we did not modify the number of labels to maintain consistencyin labeling. When dealing with factuality questions in low-resource languages, for Chinese, the 5undergraduate students we hired are native Chinese speakers. For other low-resource languages,we first use Google Translate to translate them into English and generate factuality questions, thentranslate the English questions back to the corresponding languages. The label distribution is shownin Table 1. We paid the annotators accordingly based on the quantity and quality of the annotations.We ensure the quality of the annotated factuality questions in two ways. The two authors of thispaper served as meta-reviewers, sampling 10 questions from each of the three categories across theseven domains in Pinocchio. The meta-reviewers judged if the factuality labels were correct. Forthe 210 factuality questions, the average label accuracy was 92.4%. We divided the 10 students intotwo groups and had each group re-annotate a random 200 questions annotated by the other group,then calculated inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The final IAA was 85.6%. Based on meta-reviewerresults and IAA, the factuality labels in Pinocchio are of good quality.3METHODOLOGY3.1MODELSTo give a comprehensive view of the status of LLMs in a factual context, we evaluate 10 accessibleLLMs, undergone different training stages including pretraining, instruction tuning, and reinforcementlearning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022), covering diverse organizations and varying insize. A detailed description can be found in Appendix A.2.3.2PROMPT STRATEGYAs illustrated in Figure 2, we employ 4 types of prompts to elicit desired responses from LLMs,namely: Zero-shot, Zero-shot with CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), Few-shot, and Few-shot with CoT (Weiet al., 2022). Specifically, we begin by providing the model with task instruction, denoted as Z: “You4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Table 2: Results obtained using different forms of prompts on 10 accessible LLMs.MethodsZero-shot w/o CoTZero-shot w/ CoTFew-shot w/o CoTFew-shot w/ CoTOverall PerformanceAccuracyF1AccuracyF1AccuracyF1AccuracyF1AccuracyF1OPT-6.7B————36.927.937.928.518.814.3BLOOM-7B29.726.214.818.129.728.16.612.220.221.2LLaMA-7B31.829.622.324.936.828.635.331.431.628.6Alpaca-7B40.223.733.724.437.924.939.426.237.824.8Vicuna-7B33.233.634.232.935.534.848.540.637.934.9Vicuna-13B42.635.644.036.947.038.647.042.545.238.4ChatGLM-6B37.431.036.531.741.637.942.937.539.634.5Flan-T5-11B24.621.529.929.325.923.738.438.429.726.9Text-Davinci-00245.236.245.737.346.640.446.242.545.939.1Text-Davinci-00342.841.443.142.148.843.246.943.445.542.5GPT-3.5-Turbo46.944.346.844.447.244.747.145.747.044.8will be given a question. You should answer whether it is Yes, No, or Not Sure Enough and show yourevidence”. This instruction informs the LLMs about the expected input and output. Subsequently, forany given input Q, we anticipate obtaining an output label Y from the LLMs f: Y = f(Q, Z).Zero-Shot PromptIn the zero-shot setting, the LLMs are expected to provide answers based on theQuestion Q and the task instruction Z. We anticipate that the LLMs can directly generate the factualanswer “No” when presented with Q: “Has gas prices gone up 99 percent since Obama becamepresident, making it the highest gas price increase since Carter?” The zero-shot with CoT settingextends the question Q by adding a two-stage prompt (Kojima et al., 2022): “Let’s think step bystep”, designed to encourage the LLMs to contemplate the process of determining the factual label Y .Few-Shot PromptIn the few-shot setting, we employ three shots for model input (Q). Detailedexamples of the prompts in Figure 2 are presented in Appendix A.4. In the few-shot with CoTsetting, we provide potential reasoning instructions to the LLMs before presenting the factual label(Y ). As shown in Figure 2, for the Q: “Is there a capital called Mogadish?” Our reasoningapproach entails first explaining the noun phrase in the Q (the subject and object), and subsequentlyelaborating on modifying phrases such as predicates or adjectives. Regarding the subject “Mogadish”,we begin by furnishing a detailed definition: “Mogadishu is a city in East Africa, specifically inSomalia.” Following this, we proceed to reason about the relation between “Mogadish” and “capital”:“Furthermore, the capital of Somalia is indeed Mogadishu.” Consequently, we arrive at the ultimatefactual label: “Therefore, the answer is Yes.”4EXPERIMENTSIn an effort to take the initial step in understanding the capabilities of LLMs, we undertake acomprehensive analysis of various LLMs on Pinocchio, under different conditions and tasks.4.1MAIN RESULTSIn Table 2, we present the average results of 10 accessible LLMs operating under varying settings onPinocchio, run three times each. From Table 2, we draw the following conclusions:• Regarding overall performance, we observe that, on average, LLMs without instruction tuningunderperform those with instruction tuning by 16.0%. GPT family LLMs undergoing RLHFexhibit superior results, indicating that instruction tuning and RLHF optimize alignment withhuman knowledge, thereby improving factual question response accuracy.• Results obtained using the Few-shot setting significantly outperform those obtained when simplyasking factual questions to LLMs in the Zero-shot setting, especially for models without RLHF,exhibiting an average improvement of 7.3%. This highlights the capability of some sampleprompts to better extract the inherent factual knowledge of LLMs.• Using the CoT method, we observed a relative boost in performance in LLMs subjected toinstruction tuning and RLHF, improving by an average of 2.1%. Notably, the factual accuracy ofLLMs like OPT, BLOOM, and LLaMA was mostly stable or even decreased. A review of outputsfrom these untuned LLMs revealed that, post-CoT application, LLMs tend to produce related5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Table 3: Results of different LLMs using Few-shot w/ CoT prompts across different tasks.TaskMultifacetedStructuralAdversarialTemporalReal-WorldDomain SpecificMulti-lingualAcc.F1Acc.F1Acc.F1Acc.F1Acc.F1Acc.F1Acc.F1OPT-6.7B34.524.145.530.951.851.730.018.053.727.528.228.316.217.7BLOOM-7B10.713.50.83.52.03.73.77.75.48.511.815.69.815.9LLaMA-7B38.333.944.132.143.246.141.630.026.426.323.625.027.827.7Alpaca-7B38.628.848.023.646.435.149.626.124.519.942.926.824.217.7Vicuna-7B44.236.049.736.359.059.250.137.649.041.844.338.646.743.1Vicuna-13B49.945.348.137.958.960.045.437.847.742.743.540.437.837.9ChatGLM-6B41.036.046.835.751.548.639.432.448.934.835.235.037.135.3Flan-T5-11B49.249.443.533.754.756.631.630.631.129.435.634.625.314.4Text-Davinci-00247.747.750.838.464.264.333.931.151.741.436.436.143.139.5Text-Davinci-00351.147.844.333.764.163.741.435.148.042.840.441.443.743.6GPT-3.5-Turbo53.653.144.837.867.467.437.433.950.443.138.740.341.341.1content considerations, and extensive considerations often overshadow factual discernment tasks,causing incorrect factual label outputs. In contrast, for instruction-tuned LLMs, the CoT methodfacilitates enhanced exploration of factual entity relations in questions, resulting in accuratefactual labels. See Appendix A.5 for detailed case analyses.• The OPT model, without being tuned to instructions, struggles significantly to output correctfactual labels under the settings of Zero-shot and Zero-shot CoT, often resulting in either arepetition of the original question or a refusal to output any content at all. This issue is somewhatalleviated under the settings of Few-shot and Few-shot CoT.• Additionally, we studied the hyperparameters of LLMs. Due to limited computing resources,we only explored Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B. We found that as model parameters increase,performance on factual questions improves correspondingly, with an average increase of 5.4%.This indicates that LLMs with more parameters can store more world knowledge and havestronger factual knowledge recognition capabilities.In Table 3, we present the factual performance of LLMs in various tasks under the Few-shot CoTsetting. This reveals the relative difficulty LLMs have in understanding and responding to factualquestions in different tasks, providing insights for future training of factual knowledge in LLMs.From Table 3, it is observed that LLMs exhibit relatively poorer performance on factual questionsrelated to the real-world, domain-specific knowledge, and multilingualism, being on average 6.4%lower compared to the other four tasks. This is attributed to the fact that the training data for LLMstypically come from general domains and are not up-to-date, which indirectly inspires the explorationof retrieval-augmented LLMs (Ram et al., 2023). We analyze the LLMs in different tasks in Sec. 4.2.4.2ANALYSISIn this section, we explore LLMs’ capabilities focusing on key areas like handling of multi-hop factualquestions, proficiency in diverse prompt strategies, and tackling challenges like numerical reasoningand entity ambiguity. We also examine their performance on time-sensitive factual questions, againstadversarial attacks, with fine-grained labels and prompts in multiple languages.1 Hop2 Hops3 HopsMultiHops 1 Hop  2 Hops 3 Hops 020040060080010001200Class Counts100020090200120025040202530354045505551.348.447.045.240.639.430.2MultifactedStructrualF1 of MultifactedF1 of Structrual(a) Multi-hop Reasoning AnalysisOnly SentencesOnly TablesCombine BothSentences and Tables800900100011001200130014001500160015951135121432343638404240.034.834.3Class CountsClass Performance(b) Structural Knowledge AnalysisEntityDisambiguationOtherMulti-hopReasoningCombiningTablesand Text Searchterms notin claimNumericalReasoning05001000150020009521806215377343820253035404550Macro F140.939.533.432.729.027.9Class CountsClass Performance(c) Challenges of Different QuestionsFigure 3: GPT-3.5-Turbo’s outcomes across three distinct tasks under Few-shot CoT setting.Multi-hop Factual Question AnalysisTo analyze the performance of LLMs when faced withfactual questions based on multiple pieces of facts that require complex logical reasoning, wecategorize multifaced and structural factual questions into distinct subsets, depending on the numberof “hops” necessary to validate each factual question. To maintain fairness, we randomly sampled1,490 data pieces from each of the two datasets for verification. Figure 3(a) illustrates the data6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024counts and Macro F1 scores of GPT-3.5-Turbo for each respective subset. The figure reveals a clearpattern: as the number of “hops” increases, the reasoning chain for deriving conclusions from existingfactual knowledge extends, necessitating heightened logical reasoning capabilities from the LLMs.Consequently, the performance of the LLMs exhibits diminishing trends.Structural Knowledge Analysis in LLMsTo investigate whether LLMs can effectively memorizefactual knowledge from structured data, we divided the structural task questions into three subsetsaccording to evidence distribution: evidence in unstructured data (Only text), structured data (Onlytables), or both (Combine text and tables). Figure 3(b) shows a notable decline (Avg. -5.5%) inGPT-3.5-Turbo’s performance when evidence involves structured data, indicating LLMs’ limitedability in extracting knowledge from structured tables. The LLMs also perform less effectively whenhandling questions requiring the combination of both evidence types, reflecting their incapacity tointegrate diverse structured evidence effectively.Analysis of Different Factual Questions Poses ChallengesTo assess the capabilities of LLMs inaddressing various challenges, we partitioned each factual question within the structural task into sixdistinct challenges: 1) Entity disambiguation, 2) Other, 3) Multi-hop reasoning, 4) Combining tablesand text, 5) Search terms not in claim, 6) Numerical reasoning, each centered around the most criticaldifficulty encountered during verification. Figure 3(c) illustrates GPT-3.5-Turbo’s performance anddata distribution across challenges. The extensive training and large-scale parameters enhance LLMs’performance in handling entity ambiguity. Longer reasoning chains and various forms of evidencechallenge LLMs’ factual abilities. When correct inference involves unmentioned entities, LLMsmay lack necessary hints from factual questions, posing significant challenges. LLMs also exhibitdeficiencies in precise numerical calculations due to the inherent hallucination phenomenon, resultingin subpar performance when numerical reasoning is needed for verification.

However, due to the heterogeneity among ta-bles, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data predic-tion (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diversedomains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend featurenames from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferringknowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete textrepresentation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values intables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tab-ular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization convertsscalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, andan intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the correspond-ing feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trainedTP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive withGradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.1INTRODUCTIONTabular data, a common data form, is pivotal in various fields such as medical trial predictions (Has-san et al., 2020) and financial risk detection (Aziz et al., 2022). The remarkable successes of deepneural networks (DNNs) in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) havespurred interest in applying DNNs to tabular data for tasks like classification or regression (Popovet al., 2020; Song et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023b), which also pave the road forcross-modality processing. However, most current research on tabular data relies on fully super-vised paradigms (Arik & Pfister, 2021; Gorishniy et al., 2021; Somepalli et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023;Hollmann et al., 2023), and with typically limited data available for DNNs in this regime, GradientBoosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) (Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Ke et al., 2017; Prokhorenkova et al.,2018) continue to outperform these paradigms (Grinsztajn et al., 2022).As widely evidenced in the CV and NLP fields, the transferability of DNNs consistently broughtabout substantial performance boosts and decreased data demands in downstream tasks (Devlinet al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). However, how to utilize the transferability of DNNson tabular data is still much under-explored. One major obstacle is the feature heterogeneity amongtables (Borisov et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022). Unlike images, which often exhibitsimilar feature distributions (e.g., consistent pixel intensity ranges and color distributions) (Chenet al., 2023a), structured tables inherently contain diverse columns and feature spaces, leading toconsiderable heterogeneity and feature space shifts between pre-training and downstream datasets.Related Work. Recent studies highlight the importance of tabular transfer learning, with initialefforts like TransTab (Wang & Sun, 2022) and XTab (Zhu et al., 2023) utilizing shared Transformer∗Work under partial support from the Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine.†Corresponding authors. Codes are available at https://github.com/jyansir/tp-berta.1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024blocks in the FT-Transformer architecture (Gorishniy et al., 2021) for cross-table learning. TransTabfocused on clinical trial tables with common feature names, facilitating partially overlapped featureembeddings, whereas XTab explored a broader domain with dataset-specific encoders. However,neither achieved comprehensive knowledge transfer, resulting in moderate pre-training performance.The advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated their capability to act as common-sense knowledge bases (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021; Zha et al., 2023).Through self-supervised pre-training on extensive domain-agnostic corpora, LMs can implicitly cap-ture associations among different words or phrases, showcasing potential as tabular transfer agentswith their inherent support for feature name processing within a unified language space. Despitethis potential, early attempts of applying LMs to tabular prediction were limited to synthetic tablegeneration (e.g., missing value imputation) and faced challenges. GReaT (Borisov et al., 2023)and TapTap (Zhang et al., 2023) fine-tuned GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) on simply templated ta-ble texts, treating numerical values as strings, which led to insensitivity to such values (Qian et al.,2023). A contemporary work (Ye et al., 2024) developed a BERT-based model (CT-BERT) usinga large tabular database and similar techniques to TransTab. However, these studies overlooked thecustomization of LMs for understanding continuous numerical values, which is a critical aspect oftables and presents challenges to LMs due to their inherent complexity and rarity (Qian et al., 2023).To unlock LMs’ power and take a pioneering step on LM-based tabular transfer learning, in thispaper, we propose a tailored pre-trained LM for tabular prediction based on RoBERTa (Liu et al.,2019), called the Tabular Prediction adapted BERT approach (TP-BERTa). TP-BERTa maintainsthe strengths of LMs as well as possessing the sensitivity to numeric features. Specifically, TP-BERTa discretizes numerical feature values as relative magnitude tokens (RMT) in order to treatthem as some meaningful words in the LM’s vocabulary. The design of relative magnitude tokensenables the LM to perceive relative value magnitudes in the language space. In this way, we decouplethe representations of feature names and numerical values (compared to FT-Transformer, TransTab,and CT-BERT), preserving the semantic signal of feature names. Further, we develop a shared intra-feature attention (IFA) module to attentively fuse the embeddings of a feature’s name and value intoa single vector. IFA retains the text order in a feature name, and outputs a vector for each featurename-value pair to the subsequent LM process to achieve feature order-agnostic prediction.We pre-train TP-BERTa on numerous large tabular datasets (101 binary classification and 101 re-gression datasets), and provide three versions (i.e., pre-trained on only classification tasks, or onlyregression tasks, or both). We conduct evaluations on extensive downstream datasets: (1) perfor-mance comparison with classical GBDTs, advanced deep tabular models, and cross-table modelsshows that our TP-BERTa (the pre-trained versions on a single task type, with default hyperparam-eters) outperforms the other tabular DNNs and is competitive with GBDTs in the overall rank on145 downstream datasets; (2) comparison with two existing numerical encoding strategies (Borisovet al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024) shows that our RMT adaption achieves average AUC improvementsof 12.45% and 3.44% on significantly changed (i.e., with AUC variation over 0.5%) downstreambinary classification datasets, respectively; (3) ablation on table-specific designs for LM adaption.Contributions. In a nutshell, our work offers: (1) A pre-trained LM for tabular data: dealingwith fundamental difficulties in LM adaption to tabular data (i.e., numeric feature handling and tab-ular feature organization), we develop LM-based tabular DNNs and pre-train a tabular-data-tailoredLM called TP-BERTa; (2) superior performances: comparisons with various existing methods on145 downstream datasets demonstrate that pre-trained LMs can outperform common tabular DNNsand are competitive with GBDTs in typical tabular regime; (3) in-depth analysis: multi-facet com-parison implies that TP-BERTa has a data appetite of informative discrete features, and key ablationexperiments show that our RMT and IFA adaptions are successful.2TP-BERTA: TABULAR PREDICTION ADAPTED BERT APPROACHOur proposed TP-BERTa is built on the basis of RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) as default. Its modelarchitecture and key components (the relative magnitude tokenization approach and intra-featureattention module) are shown in Fig. 1. Below we introduce our novel (i) relative magnitude to-kenization (RMT) for numerical value representation, (ii) intra-feature attention (IFA) module forfeature name-value matching before the LM processing, and (iii) the overall pre-training paradigm.2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20242.1RELATIVE MAGNITUDE TOKENIZATIONTabular features can be roughly categorized into continuous type (i.e., numerical features) and dis-crete type (categorical, binary, or string features). Although discrete feature values with clear seman-tics (e.g., “male” and “female” are values of a discrete feature “gender”) can be naturally understoodby LMs, it is still difficult to make numerical features fully understandable to LMs due to their widerange of values and counter-intuitive meanings of exact numerical values. In this section, we presenta novel Relative Magnitude Tokenization (RMT) approach to boost numerical value understanding.Numerical Discretization. Our RMT process is inspired by classical works on feature binning(Dougherty et al., 1995; Gorishniy et al., 2022) that utilized discretization techniques for numericalfeatures. To deal with diverse labeled tabular datasets, we adopt a target-aware binning methodsimilar to (Gorishniy et al., 2022). Specifically, the “C4.5 Discretization” algorithm (Kohavi &Sahami, 1996) is applied to each numerical feature by recursively splitting its value range guided byits label. This process is equivalent to building a decision tree, and continuous values are groupedinto corresponding tree leaves. The boundary values of all the leaves are used to split the value rangeinto multiple bins. Each numerical value is converted to its bin index after discretization, as:e(i) = C4.5(x(i),train, y(i),train),(1)BinIndex(x(i)j ) ≡k,(2)where x(i),train is the vector of the i-th numerical feature values in the training set, y(i),train is thecorresponding labels, e(i) denotes the vector of leaf node boundary values (in ascending order), x(i)jis the i-th feature value of sample j, and k is its bin index if e(i)k≤x(i)j< e(i)k+1. In TP-BERTa, we setthe maximum numerical bin (magnitude token) number (denoted as nbin) to 256 (i.e., 0 ≤k < 256),unless otherwise specified. A bin index represents a relative magnitude in the value range.Magnitude Tokenization. To transform numerical values into the language space, we treat thenumerical bins as new words. Specifically, nbin additional tokens are added to the RoBERTa vo-cabulary with randomly initialized token embeddings. Each numerical value is discretized with afeature-specific C4.5 process and mapped to these shared magnitude tokens. Since there may be alarge number of values in a single numerical bin, the final token embedding of a numerical value is itscorresponding bin token embedding multiplied with the value itself, i.e., RMT(x(i)j ) ≡Eextra:,k ×x(i)j ,where Eextra:,kdenotes the k-th embedding of the RoBERTa additional vocabulary for the numeri-cal magnitude. These embeddings are shared across any numerical features or datasets that purelyrepresent relative magnitudes with word vectors. Just as LMs show general capability of languagemodeling based on reasonable pair-wise word similarity, we seek to make the designed “magni-tude embeddings” follow a similar relationship. Hence, we devise a magnitude-aware triplet loss toregularize the learning process of the magnitude embeddings. We formulate the regularization as:Lreg = max(d(f(k1), f(k2)) −d(f(k1), f(k3)) + m(k1, k2, k3), 0),s.t. | k1 −k2 | < | k1 −k3 |,(3)f(k) = LayerNorm(Linear(Eextra:,k )),(4)m(k1, k2, k3) = | k1 −k3 | −| k1 −k2 |nbin,(5)where k1, k2, and k3 are three bin indices, and d(x, y) is the L2 distance between vectors x and y.In a nutshell, this regularization process assists to pull the embedding of a bin close to the embeddingof a nearby one, while pushing away from the embedding of a bin far away from it, serving as anauxiliary loss to help embedding learning for magnitude tokens.Tabular Feature Pre-processing. A tabular sample may contain features of different types. Weprocess each feature i by simply concatenating the embeddings of its feature name (Enamei∈Rl1×d)and value (Evaluei∈Rl2×d), i.e., Ei = Enamei⊗Evaluei, where d is the hidden dimension of theRoBERTa embeddings, l1 is the token length of the feature name, and l2 is the length of the featurevalue. Notably, l2 ≡1 for numerical features. As for categorical features, we convert their valuesinto structured texts (e.g., value “0” of the feature “gender” is mapped to “male”). Note that we donot distinguish binary and categorical ones in this paper since they are both converted to meaningful3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024RMT processPosition IDs[CLS]Input TokensBPMT#𝒊[CLS]num. feature embeddingGFemaleSharedMHSA[CLS]G[CLS]BPIFA processLM EncoderClassificationor Regression HeadPre-training& FinetuneBPGenderfemaleSemantic EmbeddingLayerFemaleEmbedding…cat. feature embeddingoutcomenth MT embedding1st MT embedding……minmax123.6Semantic EmbeddingLayer𝑖th MT embeddingBPCat. feature valuesFeature namesInput tableGenderMT#𝑖[CLS]BP0120Figure 1: Illustrating the TP-BERTa workflow. “BP” in the input table denotes the feature nametext “blood pressure”. The rectangles with “B”, “P”, and “Gender” (“G”) represent word embed-ding of “blood”, “pressure”, and “gender”, respectively. In the RMT process, numerical values arediscretized by the feature-specific C4.5 decision tree. In the IFA process, “MT#i” indicates the i-thmagnitude token. All numerical features share these MT embeddings for magnitude representation.“MHSA” is a shared multi-head self-attention across all features for feature refinement.texts. Some datasets contain string features, such as a feature “movie comment” with unstructuredtexts. We process the values of these feature types in the same way as for feature names.2.2INTRA-FEATURE ATTENTION MODULEPrevious attempts of using LMs to process tables still face three lingering issues. (1) Targets in tab-ular predictions are independent of feature permutations, while LMs inherently process texts withpositional encoding since positions of linguistic units matter. (2) When we simply feed all fea-ture values with names into a vanilla LM (e.g., “[Gender] is female, [Blood Pressure] is 123.8”), itlikely increases the training difficulty of LMs since they have to understand the correctly matchedname-value pairs of features and learn to alleviate interference from other features. However, fullyconnected attention mechanism (commonly adopted in auto-encoder LMs) makes it inevitable togenerate mismatched name-value signal. (3) Feeding the whole templated text can incur compu-tation burden caused by excessively long sequences when the feature amount is large. Recently, asolution was given for issue (1) by augmenting a sample with copies of different feature permuta-tions (Borisov et al., 2023), and position encoding was directly dropped and text order of featurenames was ignored (Ye et al., 2024). But, they all neglected issues (2) and (3). Hence, we developthe intra-feature attention (IFA) module for feature refinement before feeding features to the LM.IFA is essentially a single multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module shared across all features anddatasets. It accepts embeddings of a feature name-value pair and fuses them into a single vector. Weformulate the process of IFA fusion on a single feature i as:H(i) = eCLS ⊗E(i),(6)Q(i) = W Tq (H(i) + P (i)), K(i) = W Tk (H(i) + P (i)), V (i) = W Tv H(i),(7)ˆH(i) = MHSA(Q(i), K(i), V (i)), ˆh(i) ≡ˆH(i):,Index(CLS),(8)where E(i) ∈R(l1+l2)×d is concatenation of name-value embeddings, eCLS ∈R1×d is the [CLS]embedding, Wq, Wk, and Wv ∈Rd×d are transformations for query, key, and value vectors, andP (i) ∈R(1+l1+l2)×d is position embeddings. IFA uses the output vector at the [CLS] positionˆh(i) as refined feature information and feeds it to the subsequent RoBERTa. It can be clearly seenthat information from both the name and value is included in ˆh(i), and information from otherfeature names or values cannot corrupt feature i’s representation. As shown in Fig. 1(IFA process),the positions of the [CLS] token and magnitude token are assigned to id 0, and those of featurenames are from 1 to l1. This design aims to make the [CLS] token pay more attention to values(which are probably more important for prediction) as well as keeping the text order of featurenames. Notably, we remove position encoding on value vectors (see Eq. (7)); the key reason forthis is to protect magnitude token embeddings from the impact of embeddings at a constant idposition (e.g., position id 0). Since magnitude embeddings are randomly initialized and intentionallyregularized to represent the meaning of the relative magnitude carefully, a constant signal may distortthe representations and thus make the embedding learning process more difficult.4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20242.3OVERALL TRAINING PARADIGMAfter features are processed by the IFA module, an n-feature sample is organized as the concatena-tion of feature vectors and a [CLS] embedding to be the RoBERTa input, i.e., X ≡eCLS⊗ˆh1⊗ˆh2⊗· · ·⊗ˆhn ∈R(1+n)×d, which is computation-friendly. Since the text order of feature names has beenconsidered in ˆhi, we can avoid position encoding in this step, and achieve feature order-agnosticprediction. The prediction is based on the [CLS] output of the RoBERTa-Encoder, as:ˆym = PredictionHead(m)(RoBERTa-Encoder(X(m)):,Index(CLS)),(9)PredictionHead(x) = Dropout(Linear1(Tanh(Linear2(x)))),(10)where X(m) represents the input from the m-th task (dataset), and we use task-specific predictionheads PredictionHead(m), the shared RoBERTa, and the IFA module (constituting TP-BERTa) toperform supervised pre-training on extensively large tabular datasets. The final pre-training lossconsists of supervised loss and regularization loss (see Eq. (3)), as:L = Lsup + λLreg,(11)where for the supervised loss Lsup, we use binary cross entropy loss for binary classification tasksand mean squared error loss for regression tasks. We keep a constant weight λ ≡0.1 in pre-training. For downstream tasks, ordinary finetune is adopted only with Lsup. We exclude multi-classdatasets in this work as in (Grinsztajn et al., 2022), for the reasons: (1) they can be decomposed intomultiple binary classification tasks, (2) the trends on binary classification can essentially reflect theclassification ability, and (3) multi-class datasets are not very common in tabular dataset collections.3EXPERIMENTSWe first compare our TP-BERTa with classical and advanced tabular prediction models, including(1) the dominating GBDTs, (2) advanced deep tabular models, and (3) recent open-source cross-table models or pre-trained tabular models. We utilize extensive downstream datasets, and analyzethe huge potential of our pre-trained LM, TP-BERTa, as a powerful tabular prediction learner fromthe data perspective (Sec. 3.2). Based on that, we further demonstrate how the encoding strategy ofnumerical values impacts the LMs’ performances, and discuss why they were neglected in previoustabular prediction research (Sec. 3.3). Transferability evaluations (Sec. 3.4) and design ablations(Sec. 3.5) are conducted to reflect the generalization capability and rational adaption of TP-BERTa.3.1EXPERIMENTAL DETAILSDatasets. We leverage the high-quality large semantic tabular database TabPertNet (Ye et al., 2024).Datasets with at least 10,000 samples and no more than 32 features are taken for pre-training, anddatasets with fewer than 10,000 samples are collected as downstream tasks (following the same “typ-ical tabular data” settings of “medium-sized dataset regime” and “not high dimensional” in (Grin-sztajn et al., 2022)). We strictly remove the same datasets in the database and make sure that nosubset of pre-training datasets (e.g., a small version of a large dataset) appears in the downstreamones. Since LMs are fueled by meaningful texts, we manually exclude datasets with uninformativefeature names (e.g., feature names like “v1, v2, x1, x2”) or unmappable categorical features (e.g.,a feature “job” with values “0, 1, 2”). Note that those excluded datasets can still benefit from ourmodel with simple feature preprocessing with their corresponding data dictionaries. In total, ourpre-training datasets consist of 101 binary classification datasets and 101 regression datasets withabout 10 million samples, and our downstream datasets consist of 80 binary classification datasetsand 65 regression datasets. Detailed dataset statistics are provided in Appendix B.Pre-training Details. Since our work does not focus on the curriculum learning issue, we warp allthe datasets into a large data-loader, which provides a data batch from a randomly selected datasetper training step. Each dataset is learned with a dataset-specific prediction head and the shared TP-BERTa (see Sec. 2.3). Because the massive LM is likely to overfit a single dataset, we use 5% ofthe training data as the validation set. For binary classification, we keep the same label distributionsfor the training set and validation set. Pre-training is conducted on four NVIDIA A100 Tensor CoreGPUs, with a total batch size of 512 per step.

We provide threeTP-BERTa versions: pre-trained on only binary classification tasks, or only regression tasks, or bothtypes. More detailed pre-training information and analysis are given in Appendix D.Compared Methods. We compare our TP-BERTa with (1) the representative non-deep learningmodels XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) and CatBoost (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018); (2) knownDNNs including MLP, TabNet (Arik & Pfister, 2021), AutoInt (Song et al., 2019), DCNv2 (Wanget al., 2021), FT-Transformer (FTT) (Gorishniy et al., 2021), and SAINT (Somepalli et al., 2022);(3) the recent open-source cross-table model TransTab (Wang & Sun, 2022) and pre-trained modelXTab (Zhu et al., 2023). We split each finetune dataset ((64%, 16%, 20%) for training, validation,and testing separately), and keep the same label distribution in each split on binary classification.Hyperparameter Tuning & Finetune. We implement our TP-BERTa with PyTorch and the Hug-gingFace Transformers package on Python 3.8. All the models are finetuned on NVIDIA RTX 3090.In training, we uniformly use a training batch size of 64 for all the DNNs. Since the LM takes an in-creased training time, we directly set fixed hyperparameters on the pre-trained TP-BERTa across allthe downstream datasets without tuning. For the other DNNs, the optimizer is AdamW (Loshchilov& Hutter, 2019) with the default configuration except for the learning rate and weight decay rate. Wefollow the hyperparameter spaces from the original work for SAINT. For TransTab, we use its defaulthyperparameters without cross-table pre-training because it originally required partially overlappedmedical tables. For XTab, we follow its settings that report the score of the best pre-trained check-point on the validation set, with other hyperparameters kept fixed. For XGBoost, CatBoost, and theother DNNs, we follow the default (for GBDTs and FT-Transformer) and tuning settings providedin (Gorishniy et al., 2021). Hyperparameter search is performed with the Optuna library (Akibaet al., 2019). More detailed information of hyperparameters is provided in Appendix E.3.2ARE PRE-TRAINED TP-BERTA GREAT TABULAR PREDICTION LEARNERS?Overall Comparison. Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of model ranks on twodataset collections. As expected, a similar trend as shown in (Grinsztajn et al., 2022) is attained:GBDTs (i.e., XGBoost and CatBoost) still outperform classical and advanced DNNs in typical tabu-6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 2: Rank variation curve plots of several representative models with respect to variations ofsome feature type characteristics. Each point represents a set of datasets in a range of α or β.lar regime (specified in “Datasets”of Sec. 3.1). Yet, it is worth noting that the pre-trained TP-BERTaexhibits a significantly different progress and competitive performances. This notable improvementmay be attributed to the generalization ability of the pre-trained LMs (e.g., GPT-3 (Brown et al.,2020)). A medium-sized dataset (with < 10K points and low-dimensional features) may not havesufficient information for non-pre-trained DNNs, while LMs are able to leverage semantic infor-mation from feature names and structured values. Besides, our RMT approach further enables theLMs to handle numerical values in the language space (Sec. 3.3 discusses the necessity of RMT).Few previous deep tabular models were evaluated in such data settings, and this is the first time anextensive comparison on typical tabular data is brought to the forefront. As for cross-table models,TransTab was inspired by overlapped columns between pre-training datasets and downstream ones,which can benefit on domain datasets (e.g., medical tables), but general tables can contain manyfeatures from various domains, thus constraining its application. XTab adopted dataset-specificfeaturizers, though a Transformer backbone is shared; it misses the inherent relationship betweenfeatures of different datasets and learns the feature embeddings from scratch, which may be trappedin insufficiently generalized data patterns. TP-BERTa is able to exploit feature semantics, e.g., thepatterns learned on feature values “male & female” in pre-training can be inherently transferred to“boy & girl” by LMs without compulsory need for overlapped features or dataset-specific encoders.Comparison from the Fea"," we present a specifically pre-trained language model for tabular data prediction .

"Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024EVALUATINGTHEZERO-SHOTROBUSTNESSOFINSTRUCTION-TUNED LANGUAGE MODELSAnonymous authorsPaper under double-blind reviewABSTRACTInstruction fine-tuning has recently emerged as a promising approach for improvingthe zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on new tasks. Thistechnique has shown particular strength in improving the performance of modestlysized LLMs, sometimes inducing performance competitive with much larger modelvariants. In this paper we ask two questions: (1) How sensitive are instruction-tunedmodels to the particular phrasings of instructions, and, (2) How can we make themmore robust to such natural language variation? To answer the former, we collect aset of 319 English instructions manually written by NLP practitioners for over 80unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks, and we evaluate the varianceand average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasingsobserved during instruction fine-tuning. We find that using novel (unobserved)but appropriate instruction phrasings consistently degrades model performance,sometimes substantially so. Further, such natural instructions yield a wide variancein downstream performance, despite their semantic equivalence. Put anotherway, instruction-tuned models are not especially robust to instruction re-phrasings.We propose a simple method to mitigate this issue by introducing “soft prompt”embedding parameters and optimizing these to maximize the similarity betweenrepresentations of semantically equivalent instructions. We show that this methodconsistently improves the robustness of instruction-tuned models.1INTRODUCTIONIn the following, please note …Extract all names from the below text …Summarize the following text Given the task deﬁnition and input, reply with output.

Our analysis suggests that they do not do so very well. Shown is a casewhere pairing an example with an observed instruction yields the correct output, while providing adistinct but equivalent instruction produces an incorrect response. We analyze this fragility in-depth,and based on this analysis we propose and evaluate a simple method that mitigates it.Large Language Models (LLMs) now dominate NLP, in part because they enable zero- and few-shotadaptation to new tasks via prompting (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,2022; Zeng et al., 2022). Recent work has shown the promise of instruction-tuning, or fine-tuning1Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024LLMs with natural language instructions. This improves LLM performance in zero- and few-shot settings, sometimes dramatically, especially “mid-sized” models (Chung et al., 2022; Ouyanget al., 2022). For example, the instruction-tuned Flan-T5-XL (3B parameters; Chung et al. 2022)outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on several benchmarks, despite being dramatically smaller. Similarly,Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)—an instruction-tuned LLaMa-7B Touvron et al. (2023b)—bests GPT-3 onmultiple NLP tasks. This has motivated curation of instruction-augmented task collections (Wanget al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2021), and research into improving instruction-tuning (Longpre et al., 2023;Xu et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2021). In this work, we ask: How sensitive are instruction-tuned LMs tonatural variations in instruction phrasings? This is important given that the primary motivation ofinstruction-tuning is to permit zero-shot adaptation to new tasks via natural language: If models areoverly sensitive to particular phrasings of instructions, this may greatly limit their utility in practice.Prior work has established that LLMs do not seem to intuitively “understand” prompts (Webson &Pavlick, 2022; Jang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a), but these efforts did not focus on instruction-tuned models and their sensitivity to plausible (appropriate) instruction phrasings. Recent, contempo-raneous work (Gu et al., 2023) investigated the robustness of instruction-tuned models, and found thatinstruction-tuned T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) is robust to instruction perturbations in few-shot settings,but less so in zero-shot application. We contribute a more in-depth analysis of this phenomenonacross a much wider set of instruction-tuned models and benchmarks. Based on this analysis, we alsointroduce and evaluate a method for improving the robustness of such models.We collect a large set of task instructions manually composed by NLP researchers; these are validinstructions but distinct from those used in instruction tuning corpora. We then assess the performanceof LLMs fine-tuned on different instruction corpora when provided novel (but appropriate) instructionson two large benchmarks: MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBL (Srivastava et al., 2022). Wefind that using novel instructions in zero-shot application degrades accuracy considerably (Figure 1).For example, for Flan-T5 XXL, using instructions not observed in training but which are appropriatefor tasks leads to a 6.9 point drop in performance on average across benchmarks.Our main contributions are summarized as follows. (1) We perform a comprehensive and in-depthanalysis of the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs across three “families” of such models (Flan-T5,Alpaca, and T0) using large benchmarks. For this we collect a large set of new task instructionscomposed by researchers in NLP; we release this dataset to facilitate additional work on instructionrobustness. We observe substantial performance degradation when using “novel” (unseen in training)instructions. (2) We propose a simple method to improve robustness by encouraging LLMs to inducesimilar representations for semantically equivalent instructions; this yields promising results.2RELATED WORKMultitask learning and instruction-tuning. Training a single text-to-text model capable of handlingarbitrary queries has been an aspiration in NLP for at least half a decade. Prior to prompting andinstructing LLMs, there were efforts to unify disparate tasks by reframing them as instances ofgeneral question answering (McCann et al., 2018; Khashabi et al., 2020; Keskar et al., 2019). Recentefforts have focussed on compiling and fine-tuning LLMs on corpora comprising diverse tasks withassociated natural language instructions (Wei et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021),i.e., instruction-tuning. For example, Wang et al. (2022b) compiles over 1600 tasks and enrichesthese with both instructions and negative examples. Similarly, the recently released OPT-IML BenchIyer et al. (2022) comprises 2000 NLP tasks. The Flan 2022 task collection Longpre et al. (2023)additionally features Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style “reasoning” chains in instruction templates.These meta-resources—collections of instructions, tasks, and samples—have facilitated the trainingof instruction-tuned model families such as Flan-T5, Flan-PaLM, and OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022).Evaluating prompting and instruction capabilities. Instructions can be seen as a special sort ofmodel prompting, which a few recent efforts have critically evaluated. Webson & Pavlick (2022) askedwhether models meaningfully “understand” prompts, finding that they largely do not: Performance isoften unaffected when irrelevant and misleading prompts are provided. In follow up work, Jang et al.(2023) evaluated performance on negated prompts and observed an “inverse-scaling” phenomenonwhere performance seems to degrade with model size. PROMPTBENCH (Zhu et al., 2023) provides aset of automatically generated datasets to assess the adversarial robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs.Similarly, Li et al. (2023) evaluated LLMs under adversarial instruction “attacks”.2Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Other work has attempted to characterize when and how in-context learning (ICL)—i.e., includinga few examples in prompts—works (Min et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2022; Akyüreket al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). ICL is a form of prompting orthogonal to the present effort, as we areprimarily interested in the zero-shot adaptability of instruction-tuned LLMs.In work contemporaneous to ours, Gu et al. (2023) investigated how robust instruction-tuned modelsare to instruction perturbations (e.g., dropping words). This is qualitatively in line with our findings.Our work differs in important ways from this coincident research: (1) We provide a much morecomprehensive analysis of robustness: Gu et al. (2023) considered only T5 instruction-tuned ona single dataset, whereas we evaluate three LLM families (and varying sizes of each) using fiveinstruction tuning datasets, and we evaluate over 80 test tasks in all (Gu et al. 2023 considered only12); from this we identify representational similarity as a source of fragility. (2) On the basis of thisanalysis, we propose and evaluate a new approach to improving the robustness of instruction-tunedmodels; Gu et al. (2023) offered no mechanism to improve robustness.Improving instruction-tuning. Past work has also sought to improve instruction-tuning in variousways. One means to do so is to instruction tune based on human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022;Glaese et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023b). This tends to improveopen-ended model responses but degrade performance on downstream tasks. Another strategy isto leverage existing resources to automatically generate instruction-tuning datasets at scale. Forexample, Wang et al. (2022a) use LLMs to generate instructions, inputs, and outputs and use these toimprove their own instruction-following capabilities. In a similarly meta vein, Zhou and colleagues2022 propose using LLMs to engineer prompts. Finally, Ye et al. (2022) propose “flipping” thestandard task by tasking LLMs with generating instructions, given an input and label.3INSTRUCTION DATASETSEvaluation benchmarks. We evaluate a set of instruction-tuned models on two large benchmarks—MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BIG-BENCH (Srivastava et al., 2022)—and summarizationdatasets. MMLU is a multiple-choice question-answering benchmark comprising 57 tasks requiringexpert knowledge. BIG-BENCH is a collaboratively built benchmark of 204 diverse tasks from variousdomains; we use the BIG-BENCH LITE subset, and include only QA, multi-class, binary classificationtasks, and translation datasets, yielding 15 tasks in all.Collecting new instructions from NLP researchers. We aim to evaluate instruction-tuned modelswhen they are provided instructions that are appropriate for a given task but superficially differentfrom instructions observed in training. To this end we enlisted NLP researchers (graduate students)to compose novel instructions for the tasks considered; these particular instruction phrasings weretherefore unobserved during instruction fine-tuning.Briefly, we recruited 36 NLP graduate students working in NLP. All had at least some experiencewith instruction-tuned models and the downstream tasks included in the evaluation benchmarks.For all tasks in BBL and MMLU, 12 graduate students wrote one instruction they would use forzero-shot inference with an instruction-tuned model. We provide additional details on this instructioncollection process in Appendix J. We will release all 319 instructions collected for reproducibilityand to facilitate further research on instruction-tuned model robustness.4EVALUATING THE ROBUSTNESS OF INSTRUCTION-TUNED LLMS4.1MODELS AND DATAWe conduct experiments with publicly accessible model variants trained over three instructioncollections (which provide observed task instructions): P3 (Sanh et al., 2021), Flan-2022 (Chunget al., 2022), and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). We do not include Llama2-Chat (Touvron et al.,2023b) because its instruction-tuning data is not available. But we do offer a comparison betweenLLama2-Alpaca and LLama-Alpaca in Appendix D (which suggests that better pre-training doesnot markedly improve robustness). We manually identified all instructions that correspond to thefollowing task types: (a) Multiple-choice question answering (QA); (b) Binary classification (BC);(c) Multi-class classification (MC); (d) Summarization and; (e) Translation.3Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024QAIn this task, you are given a multiple-choice question and you have to pick thecorrect option.

These instructions are general, e.g., in the case of classification they request that the modelconsider an example with respect to categorization criteria and label space provided by the instance,and select an appropriate category (examples in Table 1). One can “mix-and-match” such instructionsso long as they are appropriate for the task type.4.2MAIN RESULTSWe present the main aggregated analysis results in Figure 2 and Table 3. The take-away here isthat using instructions unobserved in training—but manually composed for the task at hand and sosemantically appropriate—leads to considerable degradation in performance: On average, unobservedinstructions reduce accuracy by over five points across models considered. Table 3 reports resultsdisaggregated by task type; we observe that classification tasks are most harmed by use of novelinstructions.

These are representative results; detailed results with more metrics are in Appendix B4.3DOES INSTRUCTION ROBUSTNESS EMERGE AS A FUNCTION OF SCALE?We repeated all experiments from Table 3 with Flan-T5 model sizes ranging from small (80Mparameters) to XXL (11B). Figure 2b shows that the disparity between results achieved with observedversus unobserved instructions does not decrease with model scale, at least up to this point. Thatsaid, massive models (175B+) may offer improved robustness. However, we reiterate that much of5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024the excitement about instruction-tuning that this technique appears to allow much smaller models toachieve results competitive with massive alternatives. We report more details in Appendix H4.4ROBUSTNESS UNDER IN-CONTEXT LEARNING (ICL)Recent work (Gu et al., 2023) showed that LLMs are less sensitive to prompt variation when provided“few-shot” examples in context. We are focused on zero-shot, instruction-following capabilities; butfor completeness we re-ran all experiments in a few-shot setting. We followed the sub-samplingstrategy from 4.2, and we evaluate the same examples in the few-shot settings we did for the zero shotcase. Given space constraints, we report the full results in Appendix C, but briefly summarize ourfindings here briefly. (1) On average, ICL examples improve both performance (avg. performance)and robustness (i.e., performance with novel compared to observed instructions) slightly for mostmodels and tasks. (2) For each task, the variance of performance and robustness significantlyincreases when more shots are provided, suggesting a sensitivity to the specific ICL examples selected.In particular, model robustness varies significantly with choice of ICL examples.In sum, ICL does mitigate the robustness issue of medium-sized LLMs we have highlighted, but thisis unstable and depends on the particular selection of examples.4.5A CLOSER LOOK AT INSTRUCTION ROBUSTNESSAbove we used general instructions to induce LLMs to perform tasks (Table 1). Here we delve furtherinto the performance degradation observed when using novel instructions. We report a curious result:Incorrect but observed instructions outperform appropriate but unobserved instructions (Figure 3).We come to this observation by evaluating the performance of Flan-T5-XXL (11B) using six in-struction types over seven datasets from BIG-BENCH. This includes (variants of) two instructionsobserved in training: Closest is the instruction from the most similar task in the instruction-tuning set;Incorrect is an observed instruction for a completely different and inappropriate task (but which hasthe same desired output format)—intuitively, these should not yield the desired behavior; Negatedis the same as closest, but we negate the instruction to indicate that it should not perform the task.For unobserved instructions, we consider: Task designer, the instruction (task prefix) provided bythe author of the task in BIG-BENCH, and; Newly collected, novel and appropriate instructionswe collected as described above. For reference, we also consider Nonsensical, which is a random“instruction” completely irrelevant to any task.ObservedUnobservedNonsensical The council of street raccoons demands you respond to their inquisition ...

We report averages over benchmarks, but show example instructions onthe right for a specific, illustrative task. We provide all instructions in the Appendix.Figure 3 reports average results for these variants. Consistent with our findings, using instructionsunobserved in training degrades performance. Strikingly, here we also find that using inappropriatebut observed instructions outperforms using appropriate but unobserved instructions. This indicatesthat instruction-tuned models—at least the modestly sized ones we have evaluated here—may overlyrely on having observed instructions in training, and not generalize to new instructions and phrasingsas we might hope. We provide a full set of disaggregated results in Appendix B.2.6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20244.6ROBUSTNESS AND “SEMANTIC” DISTANCEOne observation in 4.2 is that performance on MMLU is less affected by using unobserved instruc-tions. MMLU is a benchmark with 57 QA tasks covering different domains; these tasks all share asimilar form of input-output (question, four choices →answer). During instruction collection, wetreated all tasks in MMLU as a general QA task and asked NLP researchers to write general QAinstructions. We therefore hypothesize that these instructions are comparatively similar to observedinstructions, and this in turn explains the relative robustness in this case.Figure 4 and Table 5 support this hypothesis. For each instance (instruction plus example), we extractthe representation at the penultimate layer for the first decoded token. We use tSNE (Van der Maaten& Hinton, 2008) to visualize these representations of observed and unobserved instructions overinstances in MMLU and BBL. Figure 4 shows that for MMLU, the unobserved instructions wecollected are quite similar to the observed, while there is a greater separation between unobservedand observed instructions in BBL. Table 5 further quantifies this phenomenon: We report the averageℓ2 distance between representations of unobserved instructions and those of their nearest observedcounterparts. MMLU unobserved instructions are, on average, closer to the nearest observedinstruction; this correlates with the smaller observed performance drop.MMLUBBLObservedUnobservedFigure 4: tSNE plots of representations for the first decoded tokens of 300 randomly sampledexamples from MMLU and BBL with Flan-T5 (XXL). Embeddings of observed and unobservedinstructions for MMLU are similar, while for BBL they are quite different. This result holds acrossmost but not all models considered: See Appendix I for visualizations over all models.We plot mean performance degradation (as %) as a function of average similarity between thesimilarity of the first decoded tokens (following unobserved instructions) and the same for the mostsimilar observed instruction. The negative slope implies the intuitive relationship: Instructions thatare dissimilar (in terms of model representations) correlate with poorer performance. However, therelationship is relatively weak, yielding a slope estimate of -0.2 (p =0.08).20304050607080Distance−30−25−20−15−10−50Change in performance (%)Figure 5: Average degradations in per-formance versus “semantic” distancewhile using unobserved instructions.In general, larger semantic distancescorrespond to increased degradation.DatasetAvg. ∆ℓ2Avg. ∆Acc.MMLU19.8-0.5BBL-QA37.9-3.4BBL-BC25.3-2.0BBL-MC26.1-2.8Table 5: Average degradations in performance forfour categories (Flan-T5-XXL). MMLU has mini-mal average distance, indicating a smaller distribu-tion shift; we hypothesize that this is what leads tothe relatively small degradation in performance.7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20245ALIGNING REPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVALENT INSTRUCTIONSBased on the preceding analysis, we hypothesize that that to be robust instruction-following LLMsshould induce close internal representations for instructions corresponding to similar tasks. Here wepropose a simple approach to explicitly realize this aim: We introduce a term in the objective thatencourages the model to yield similar predictions (and, correspondingly, similar representations) forthe same input when provided distinct but semantically equivalent instructions.Specifically, we add soft embedding parameters with dimensions Rd×n; this is equivalent to addingn novel tokens (with embedding dimension d) as prefixes to inputs (preceding instructions). Theintuition is to push representations for semantically equivalent tasks close together: To this end,fine-tune the soft embeddings (Li & Liang, 2021) under an additional loss term: The KL-divergenceLKL of the output probabilities between a reference instruction for a given task and a paraphrased(effectively equivalent) version of the same. We combine this with the standard cross-entropy lossand fit only the introduced soft prompt parameters under this objective (Figure 6).

Dotted (red) lines indicate backpropagation; we update only the soft prompt parameters,which we show yields performance superior to fine-tuning all model parameters.Optimizing for the above objective requires similar instructions i for each task in the training data; wegenerate these automatically as follows. For the instruction-tuning dataset, we sample a small amountof training data to use for representation alignment. We paraphrase these reference instructions usingGPT-4. For the Alpaca collection, we randomly sampled 1k tasks, paraphrased them with threeprompts, and collected the top three candidates under temperature 0.5. For the Flan collection, werandomly sampled 1k instances from the mixture with 3 prompts wit"," instruction fine-tuning has recently emerged as a promising approach for improvingthe zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs ) on new tasks. in this paper we ask two questions : (1 ) how sensitive are instruction-tunedmodels to the particular phrasings of instructions , and (2 ) how can we make themmore robust to such natural language variation ? to answer the former , we collect aset of 319 English instructions manually written by nLP practitioners for over 80unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks , and we evaluate the varianceand average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasingsobserved during instruction fine-tuning .

The reason is that current instructiontuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain.This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA)closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM,a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training,and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tooluse, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the con-struction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruc-tion generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involvingthese APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution pathannotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of APIcalls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, wedevelop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMsto evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover,to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evalu-ator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLMToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriateAPIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates aremarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs,and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demon-strates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-usedataset: APIBench. The codes, trained models, and demo are publicly available athttps://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench.1INTRODUCTIONTool learning (Qin et al., 2023b) aims to unleash the power of large language models (LLMs) to effec-tively interact with various tools (APIs) to accomplish complex tasks. By integrating LLMs with APIs,we can greatly expand their utility and empower them to serve as efficient intermediaries betweenusers and the vast ecosystem of applications. Although open-source LLMs, e.g., LLaMA (Touvronet al., 2023a), have achieved versatile capabilities through instruction tuning (Taori et al., 2023;Chiang et al., 2023), they still lack the sophistication in performing higher-level tasks, such as appro-priately interacting with tools (APIs) to fulfill complex human instruction. This deficiency is becausecurrent instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks, with a relative neglect of thetool-use domain. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT (OpenAI,∗Indicates equal contribution.† Corresponding author.1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024API CollectionInstructionGenerationSolution PathAnnotationLLaMAToolLLaMARapidAPIData Construction & Train & InferenceToolBenchSFTInstructions & relevant APIsAPI RetrieverInstructionNAPI RetrieverToolEval···Retrieved APIsFinal AnswerFigure 1:Three phases of constructing ToolBench and how we train our API retriever and ToolLLaMA.During inference of an instruction, the API retriever recommends relevant APIs to ToolLLaMA, which performsmultiple rounds of API calls to derive the final answer.

This limits thedemocratization of AI technologies and the scope of community-driven innovation and development.In this regard, we deem it urgent to empower open-source LLMs to skillfully master diverse APIs.Although prior works have explored building instruction tuning data for tool use (Li et al., 2023a;Patil et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they fail to fully stimulate the tool-usecapabilities within LLMs and have inherent limitations: (1) limited APIs: they either fail to in-volve real-world APIs (e.g., RESTAPI) (Patil et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023) or consider only asmall scope of APIs with poor diversity (Patil et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023a);0.00.20.40.60.8Pass Rate0.00.20.40.60.8Win RateVicuna & AlpacaDavinci-ReACTDavinci-DFSDTClaude2-ReACTClaude2-DFSDTChatGPT-ReACTChatGPT-DFSDTToolLLaMA-ReACTToolLLaMA-DFSDTGPT4-ReACTGPT4-DFSDTFigure 2:Pass rate (↑) and win rate (↑)of different methods in tool-use evaluation.For win rate, we compare each method withChatGPT-ReACT. DFSDT is our improvedreasoning strategy over ReACT. ToolLLaMAsurpasses Text-Davinci-003, Claude-2, andalmost performs on par with ChatGPT.(2) constrained scenario: existing works are confined toinstructions that only involve one single tool. In contrast,real-world scenarios may require that multiple tools are in-terleaved together for multi-round tool execution to solvea complex task. Besides, they often assume that usersmanually specify the ideal API set for a given instructionin advance, which is infeasible with a large collection ofreal-world APIs; (3) inferior planning and reasoning:existing works adopted either CoT (Wei et al., 2023) orReACT (Yao et al., 2022) for model reasoning, which can-not fully elicit the capabilities stored in LLMs and thus failto handle complex instructions. In addition, some worksdo not even execute APIs to obtain real responses (Patilet al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023), which serve as importantinformation for subsequent model planning.To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-sourceLLMs, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use frame-work including data construction, model training, and eval-uation. As illustrated in Figure 1, we collect a high-qualityinstruction-tuning dataset ToolBench. It is constructedautomatically using ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k), whichhas been upgraded with function call (link) capabilities.The comparison between ToolBench and prior works is listed in Table 1. Specifically, the constructionof ToolBench entails three phases:• API Collection: we gather 16,464 representational state transfer (REST) APIs from RapidAPI(link), a platform that hosts massive real-world APIs provided by developers. These APIs span 49diverse categories such as social media, e-commerce, and weather. For each API, we crawl detailedAPI documents from RapidAPI, including the functionality descriptions, required parameters,code snippets for API calls, etc. By comprehending these documents to learn to execute APIs,LLMs can generalize to new APIs unseen during training;• Instruction Generation: we first sample APIs from the whole set and then prompt ChatGPT togenerate diverse instructions for these APIs. To cover practical scenarios, we curate instructions2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024ResourceToolBench(this work)APIBench(Patil et al., 2023)API-Bank(Li et al., 2023a)ToolAlpaca(Tang et al., 2023)ToolBench(Xu et al., 2023b)Real-world API?✓✗✓✗✓Real API Call&Response?✓✗✓✗✓Multi-tool Scenario?✓✗✗✗✗API Retrieval?✓✓✗✗✓Multi-step Reasoning?✓✗✓✓✓Number of tools34513534008Number of APIs16464164553400232Number of Instances1264861700227439382746Number of Real API Calls469585056803926Avg.

This ensures that our model learns not onlyhow to interact with individual tools but also how to combine them to accomplish complex tasks;• Solution Path Annotation: each solution path may contain multiple rounds of model reasoningand real-time API calls to derive the final response. However, even the most sophisticatedLLM, i.e., GPT-4, achieves a low pass rate for complex human instructions, making annotationinefficient. To this end, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) tobolster the planning and reasoning ability of LLMs. Compared with conventional ReACT, DFSDTenables LLMs to evaluate a multitude of reasoning paths and make deliberate decisions to eitherretract steps or proceed along a promising path. In experiments, DFSDT significantly improvesthe annotation efficiency and successfully completes those complex instructions that cannot befulfilled using ReACT.To assess the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator, ToolEval, backedup by ChatGPT. It comprises two key metrics: (1) pass rate, which measures LLM’s ability tosuccessfully execute an instruction within limited budgets, and (2) win rate, which compares thequality and usefulness of two solution paths. We demonstrate that ToolEval achieves a high correlationwith human evaluation and provides a robust, scalable, and reliable assessment for machine tool use.By fine-tuning LLaMA on ToolBench, we obtain ToolLLaMA. After evaluation based on ourToolEval, we derive the following findings:• ToolLLaMA demonstrates a compelling capability to handle both single-tool and complex multi-tool instructions. As depicted in Figure 2, ToolLLaMA outperforms Text-Davinci-003 andClaude-2, achieves comparable performance to the “teacher model” ChatGPT, and is only slightlyinferior to GPT4. Besides, ToolLLaMA exhibits robust generalization to previously unseenAPIs, requiring only the API documentation to adapt to new APIs effectively. This flexibilityallows users to incorporate novel APIs seamlessly, thus enhancing the model’s practical utility.• We show that our DFSDT serves as a general decision-making strategy to enhance the reasoningcapabilities of LLMs. DFSDT broadens the search space by considering multiple reasoning tracesand achieves significantly better performance than ReACT.• We train a neural API retriever, which alleviates the need for manual selection from the largeAPI pool in practice. As shown in Figure 1, given an instruction, the API retriever recommends aset of relevant APIs, which are sent to ToolLLaMA for multi-round decision making to derivethe final answer. Despite sifting through a large pool of APIs, the retriever exhibits remarkableretrieval precision, returning APIs closely aligned with the ground truth.• ToolLLaMA exhibits strong generalization performance on an out-of-distribution (OOD) datasetAPIBench (Patil et al., 2023). Despite not training on any of the APIs or instructions on APIBench,ToolLLaMA performs on par with Gorilla, a pipeline specifically designed for APIBench.2DATASET CONSTRUCTIONWe introduce the three-stage construction process of ToolBench: API collection (§ 2.1), instructiongeneration (§ 2.2), and solution path annotation (§ 2.3). All procedures are based on ChatGPT(gpt-3.5-turbo-16k), requiring minimal human supervision and can be easily extended to new APIs.3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024FinanceJobs······MoviesGET GenresGET Search By Title···API Name: Search By Title API Description: Search movies and series by title, …Required Parameters: (1) title (string, title to search for), (2) country (string, …)Optional Parameters: (1) show_type (string, Type of shows to include in the results, either “movie”, “series”, or “all”.

Developerscan test and connect with various APIs by registering only a RapidAPI key. All APIs in RapidAPIcan be classified into 49 coarse-grained categories (link), such as sports, finance, and weather. Thecategories associate an API with the most relevant topic. Additionally, the hub also provides 500+fine-grained categorization called collections (link), e.g., Chinese APIs and database APIs. APIs inthe same collection share a common characteristic and often have similar functionalities or goals.Hierarchy of RapidAPIAs shown in Figure 3, each tool may be composed of multiple APIs. Foreach tool, we crawl the following information: the name and description of the tool, the URL of thehost, and all the available APIs belonging to the tool; for each API, we record its name, description,HTTP method, required parameters, optional parameters, request body, executable code snippets forAPI call, and an example API call response. This rich and detailed metadata serves as a valuableresource for LLMs to understand and effectively use the APIs, even in a zero-shot manner.API FilteringInitially, we gathered 10, 853 tools (53, 190 APIs) from RapidAPI. However, thequality and reliability of these APIs can vary significantly. In particular, some APIs may not bewell-maintained, such as returning 404 errors or other internal errors. To this end, we perform arigorous filtering process (details in appendix A.1) to ensure that the ultimate tool set of ToolBench isreliable and functional. Finally, we only retain 3, 451 high-quality tools (16, 464 APIs).2.2INSTRUCTION GENERATIONDifferent from prior works, we specifically focus on two crucial aspects for instruction generation:(1) diversity: to train LLMs to handle a wide range of API usage scenarios, thereby boosting theirgeneralizability and robustness; and (2) multi-tool usage: to mirror real-world situations that oftendemand the interplay of multiple tools, improving the practical applicability and flexibility of LLMs.To this end, instead of brainstorming instructions from scratch and then searching for relevant APIs,we sample different combinations of APIs and craft various instructions that involve them.Generating Instructions for APIsDefine the total API set as SAPI, at each time, we sample a fewAPIs: SsubN ={API1, · · · , APIN} from SAPI. We prompt ChatGPT to understand the functionalitiesof these APIs and then generate (1) possible instructions (Inst∗) that involve APIs in SsubN , and (2)relevant APIs (Srel∗⊂SsubN ) for each instruction (Inst∗), i.e., {[Srel1 , Inst1], · · · , [SrelN′, InstN′]}, where N′denotes the number of generated instances. These (instruction, relevant API) pairs will be used for4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024NormalNormalErrorFail···SuccessErrorThought: I will first get some information about Hailee Steinfeld.API Name: get_extra_character_detailsArguments: {“name”: “Hailee Steinfeld”}CoT / ReACTDFSDT (ours)Instruction···InstructionReasoning Chains of Different Methods···User: I want to give my friend a birthday surprise.

Weshow part of the solution path annotation process using ChatGPT (right).training the API retriever in § 3.1. We use different sampling strategies (introduced later) to cover allAPIs and most of their combinations, thus ensuring the diversity of our instructions.The prompt for ChatGPT is composed of (1) a general description of the intended instruction genera-tion task, (2) comprehensive documentation of each API in SsubN , which helps ChatGPT understandtheir functionality and interplay, and (3) three in-context seed examples {seed1, seed2, seed3}. Eachseed example is an ideal instruction generation written by human experts. These seed examples areleveraged to better regulate ChatGPT’s behavior through in-context learning. In total, we wrote 12 /36 diverse seed examples (Sseed) for the single-tool / multi-tool setting, and randomly sampled threeexamples at each time. Detailed prompts for instruction generation are described in appendix A.7.Overall, the generation process can be formulated as follows:ChatGPT{API1,··· ,APIN}∈SAPI,{seed1,··· ,seed3}∈Sseed({[Srel1 , Inst1], · · · , [SrelN’, InstN′]}|API1, · · · , APIN, seed1, · · · , seed3).Sampling Strategies for Different ScenariosAs shown in Figure 3, for the single-tool instruc-tions (I1), we iterate over each tool and generate instructions for its APIs. However, for the multi-toolsetting, since the interconnections among different tools in RapidAPI are sparse, random samplingtool combinations from the whole tool set often leads to a series of irrelevant tools that cannot becovered by a single instruction in a natural way. To address the sparsity issue, we leverage theRapidAPI hierarchy information. Since tools belonging to the same RapidAPI category or collectionare generally related to each other in the functionality and goals, we randomly select 2-5 tools fromthe same category / collection and sample at most 3 APIs from each tool to generate the instruc-tions. We denote the generated instructions as intra-category multi-tool instructions (I2) andintra-collection multi-tool instructions (I3), respectively. Through rigorous human evaluation, wefind that instructions generated in this way already have a high diversity that covers various practicalscenarios. We also provide visualization for instructions using Atlas (link) to support our claim.After generating the initial set of instructions, we further filter those with the hallucinated relevantAPIs by assessing whether they exist in SsubN . Finally, we collect nearly 200k qualified (instruction,relevant API) pairs, including 87413, 84815, and 25251 instances for I1, I2, and I3, respectively.2.3SOLUTION PATH ANNOTATIONAs shown in Figure 4, given an instruction Inst∗, we prompt ChatGPT to search for a valid actionsequence: {a1, · · · , aN}. Such a multi-step decision-making process is cast as a multi-round conver-sation for ChatGPT. At each round t, the model generates an action at based on previous interactions,i.e., ChatGPT(at|{a1, r1, · · · , at−1, rt−1}, Inst∗), where r∗denotes the real API response. For each5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024at, ChatGPT should specify its “thought”, which API to use, and the specific parameters for this API,i.e., at has the following format: “Thought: · · · , API Name: · · · , Parameters: · · · ”.To leverage the function call feature of ChatGPT, we treat each API as a special function and feedits API documentation into ChatGPT’s function field. In this way, the model understands how tocall the API. For each instruction Inst∗, we feed all the sampled APIs SsubN to ChatGPT’s as availablefunctions. To let ChatGPT finish an action sequence, we define two additional functions, i.e., “Finishwith Final Answer” and “Finish by Giving Up”. The former function has a parameter that correspondsto a detailed final answer to the original instruction; while the latter function is designed for caseswhere the provided APIs cannot complete the original instruction after multiple API call attempts.Depth First Search-based Decision TreeIn our pilot studies, we find that CoT (Wei et al., 2023)or ReACT (Yao et al., 2022) has inherent limitations: (1) error propagation: a mistaken action maypropagate the errors further and cause the model to be trapped in a faulty loop, such as continuallycalling an API in a wrong way or hallucinating APIs; (2) limited exploration: CoT or ReACT onlyexplores one possible direction, leading to limited exploration of the whole action space. Hence evenGPT-4 often fails to find a valid solution path, making annotation difficult.To this end, we propose to construct a decision tree to expand the search space and increase thepossibility of finding a valid path. As depicted in Figure 4, our DFSDT allows the model to assessdifferent reasoning paths and choose to either (1) proceed along a promising path or (2) abandonan existing node by calling the “Finish by Giving Up” function and expand a new node. Duringnode expansion, to diversify the child nodes and expand the search space, we prompt ChatGPT withthe information of the previously generated nodes and explicitly encourage the model to generate adistinct node. For the searching process, we prefer depth-first search (DFS) instead of breadth-firstsearch (BFS) because the annotation can be finished as long as one valid path is found. Using BFSwill cost excessive OpenAI API calls. More details are described in appendix A.8. We performDFSDT for all the generated instructions and only retain those passed solution paths. Ultimately, wegenerate 126, 486 (instruction, solution path) pairs, which are used to train ToolLLaMA in § 3.2.3EXPERIMENTSIn this section, we investigate the performance of ToolLLM framework. We first introduce theevaluation metric and evaluate the efficacy of API retriever and DFSDT in § 3.1. Then we present themain experiments in § 3.2, followed by a generalization experiment in § 3.3.3.1PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTSToolEvalConsidering the API’s temporal variability on RapidAPI and the infinite potential solutionpaths for an instruction, it is infeasible to annotate a fixed ground-truth solution path for each testinstruction. Considering that human evaluation can be time-consuming, we follow AlpacaEval (Liet al., 2023b) to develop an efficient evaluator ToolEval based on ChatGPT, which incorporatestwo evaluation metrics (details in appendix A.5): (1) Pass Rate: it calculates the proportion ofsuccessfully completing an instruction within limited budgets. The metric measures the executabilityof instructions for an LLM and can be seen as a basic requirement for ideal tool use; and (2) Win Rate:we provide an instruction and two solution paths to ChatGPT evaluator and obtain its preference (i.e.,which one is better). We pre-define a set of criteria for both metrics and these criteria are organizedas prompts for our ChatGPT evaluator. We evaluate multiple times based on ChatGPT to improve thereliability. Then we calculate the average results from the evaluator.Through rigorous testing (details in appendix A.5), we find that ToolEval demonstrates a highagreement of 87.1% in pass rate and 80.3% in win rate with human annotators. This shows thatToolEval can reflect and represent human evaluation to a large extent.Efficacy of API RetrieverThe API retriever aims to retrieve relevant APIs to an instruction. Weemploy Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) to train a dense retriever based on BERT-BASE (Devlin et al., 2019). The API retriever encodes the instruction and API document into twoembeddings, and calculates their relevance with embedding similarity. For training, we regard therelevant APIs of each instruction generated in § 2.2 as positive examples and sample a few otherAPIs as negative examples for contrastive learning. For baselines, we choose BM25 (Robertson et al.,6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024MethodI1I2I3AverageNDCGNDCGNDCGNDCG@1@5@1@5@1@5@1@5BM2518.419.712.011.025.220.418.517.0Ada57.558.836.830.754.646.849.645.4Ours84.289.768.277.981.787.178.084.9Table 2: Our API retriever v.s. two baselines for three types ofinstructions (I1, I2, I3).

We evaluate the retrieval performance usingNDCG (J¨arvelin & Kek¨al¨ainen, 2002). We train and evaluate our model on single-tool instructions(I1), intra-category multi-tool instructions (I2), and intra-collection multi-tool instructions (I3).As shown in Table 2, our API retriever consistently outperforms baselines across all settings, indicatingits feasibility in real-world scenarios with massive APIs. Also, the NDCG score of I1 is generallyhigher than I2 and I3, which means single-tool instruction retrieval is simpler than multi-tool setting.Superiority of DFSDT over ReACTBefore solution path annotation, we validate the efficacyof DFSDT. Based on ChatGPT, we compare DFSDT and ReACT using the pass rate metric. SinceDFSDT consumes more OpenAI API calls than ReACT, for a fairer comparison, we also establish a“ReACT@N” baseline, which conducts multiple times of ReACT until the total costs reach the samelevel of DFSDT. Once a valid solution is found by ReACT@N, we deem it a pass.From Table 3, it can be observed that DFSDT significantly outperforms the two baselines in allscenarios. Since we only retain those passed annotations as the training data, given the same budgets,using DFSDT could annotate more instructions. This makes DFSDT a more efficient way that savesthe total annotation cost. We also find that the performance improvement of DFSDT is more evidentfor harder instructions (i.e., I2 and I3) than those simpler instructions (I1). This means that byexpanding the search space, DFSDT can better solve those difficult, complex instructions that areunanswerable by the vanilla ReACT no matter how many times it is performed.3.2MAIN EXPERIMENTSToolLLaMAWe fine-tune LLaMA-2 7B model (Touvron et al., 2023b) using the instruction-solution pairs. The original LLaMA-2 model has a sequence length of 4096, which is not enoughunder our setting since the API response can be very long. To this end, we use positional interpola-tion (Chen et al., 2023) to extend the context length to 8192 (training details in appendix A.3).SettingsIdeally, by scaling the number and diversity of instructions and unique tools in the trainingdata, ToolLLaMA is expected to generalize to new instructions and APIs unseen during training. Thisis meaningful since users can define customized APIs and expect ToolLLaMA to adapt according tothe documentation. To this end, we strive to evaluate the generalization ability of ToolLLaMA atthree levels: (1) Inst.: unseen instructions for the same set of tools in the training data, (2) Tool:unseen tools that belong to the same (seen) category of the tools in the training data, and (3) Cat.:unseen tools that belong to a different (unseen) category of tools in the training data.We perform experiments on three scenarios: single-tool instructions (I1), intra-category multi-toolinstructions (I2), and intra-collection multi-tool instructions (I3). For I1, we conduct the evaluation forthe aforementioned three levels (I1-Inst., I1-Tool, and I1-Cat.); for I2, since the training instructionsalready involve different tools of the same category, we only perform level 1 and level 3 for thegeneralization evaluation (I2-Inst. and I2-Cat.); similarly, we only perform level 1 generalizationfor I3 (I3-Inst.) since it already covers instructions that involve various combinations of tools fromdifferent categories (the tools in a RapidAPI collection may come from different RapidAPI categories).For each test instruction, we feed the ground-truth (oracle) APIs SsubN to each model. This simulatesthe scenario where the user specifies the API set they prefer.BaselinesWe choose two LLaMA variants that have been fine-tuned for general-purpose dialogue,i.e., Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). We also choose the “teacher model”ChatGPT, Text-Davinci-003, GPT-4, and Claude-2 as baselines, and apply both DFSDT and ReACTto them. When calculating the win rate, each model is compared with ChatGPT-ReACT.7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024ModelMethodI1-Inst.I1-ToolI1-Cat.I2-Inst.I2-Cat.I3-Inst.AveragePassWinPassWinPassWinPassWinPassWinPassWinPassWinChatGPTReACT"," despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs ) , e.g.,LLaMA , they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities , i.e. using exter-nal tools (APIs ) to fulfill human instructions .

"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024INSTRUCTIVE DECODING:INSTRUCTION-TUNED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELSARE SELF-REFINER FROM NOISY INSTRUCTIONSTaehyeon Kim∗, Joonkee Kim∗, Gihun Lee∗, and Se-Young YunKAIST AIABSTRACTWhile instruction-tuned language models have demonstrated impressive zero-shotgeneralization, these models often struggle to generate accurate responses whenfaced with instructions that fall outside their training set. This paper presentsInstructive Decoding (ID), a simple yet effective approach that augments theefficacy of instruction-tuned models. Specifically, ID adjusts the logits for next-token prediction in a contrastive manner, utilizing predictions generated from amanipulated version of the original instruction, referred to as a noisy instruction.This noisy instruction aims to elicit responses that could diverge from the intendedinstruction yet remain plausible. We conduct experiments across a spectrum of suchnoisy instructions, ranging from those that insert semantic noise via random wordsto others like ‘opposite’ that elicit the deviated responses. Our approach achievesconsiderable performance gains across various instruction-tuned models and taskswithout necessitating any additional parameter updates. Notably, utilizing ‘opposite’as the noisy instruction in ID, which exhibits the maximum divergence from theoriginal instruction, consistently produces the most significant performance gainsacross multiple models and tasks.1INTRODUCTIONLanguage Models (LMs) have opened up a new era in Natural Language Processing (NLP) byleveraging extensive datasets and billions of parameters (Zhao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Kaplanet al., 2020). These LMs excel at In-Context Learning (ICL), generating responses based on a fewdemonstrations without needing further parameter adjustments (Wei et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020;Dong et al., 2022). The rise of instruction-tuning has further enhanced this capability, optimizing LMsto align their outputs closely with human-specified instructions (Wei et al., 2021b; Sanh et al., 2021;Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019). This approach has demonstrated a significant improvementin zero-shot scenarios, underscoring its importance for tackling diverse tasks.However, instruction-tuned models often struggle with unfamiliar tasks due to limitations in theirtraining datasets, whether the datasets are human-annotated (Mishra et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022c)or model-generated (Wang et al., 2022b; Honovich et al., 2022). Refining these datasets is essentialbut requires substantial effort and computational resources, highlighting the need for more efficientapproaches (Chung et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023). Moreover, the depth of a model’s understandingof and how they respond to instructions remains an area of active research. While recent studies haveprovided some insights (Kung & Peng, 2023; Yin et al., 2023), many questions remain unanswered.Techniques such as prompt-engineering (Wei et al., 2021a) and utilizing diversified outputs (Wanget al., 2022a) aim to increase the quality of outputs. However, the effectiveness of these techniquesoften depends on the fortuitous alignment of prompts or initial conditions, making them labor-intensive since the tuning process must be tailored for each task.In pursuit of refining the behavior of LMs, some researchers have begun to explore the anchoringeffect (Kahneman et al., 1982)—a well-known cognitive bias where initial information exerts dis-proportionate influence on subsequent judgments. Intriguingly, this cognitive principle has beendemonstrated to extend to LMs. For example, through effective prompting, the outputs generatedby LMs can be steered towards a specific intent (Jones & Steinhardt, 2022). Similarly, emphasiz-ing the first few sentences of a long context enhances the model’s overall comprehension of the∗Equal contribution1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Instructive DecodingInstruction-tunedLLMNoisy InstructionBase LogitsFinal LogitsOppositeAlways respond with the opposite of what you're asked.

In contrast, ID generates a more relevant response by refiningits next-token predictions based on the noisy instruction (here, opposite prompting is used for ID).content (Malkin et al., 2021). Given these observations on LMs—parallels that mirror human tenden-cies—and the influential role of initial prompts, we hypothesize that the strategic application of theanchoring effect could substantially improve LMs’ fidelity to instructions.In this work, we propose Instructive Decoding (ID) (Figure 1), a novel method that enhances theattention of instruction-tuned LMs towards provided instructions during the generation phase withoutany parameter updates. The essence of ID lies in the introduction of noisy instruction variants. Theseare designed to anchor the model’s output in a specific direction, potentially away from the mostoptimal predictions. This deliberate steering enables a clear anchoring effect within the languagemodels, facilitating a contrastive approach in our decoding process. Our range of variants spans fromsimple strategies such as instruction truncation and more aggressive alterations, the most extreme ofwhich is the opposite instruction. By intentionally introducing such deviations, ID capitalizes on theresulting disparities. Within a contrastive framework, next-token prediction logits that are influencedby the noisy instructions are systematically compared to those derived from the original instruction.This process refines the model’s responses to align more closely with the intended instruction.GPT3 (175B) + Fine-tuning(SupNatInst Dataset; Wang et al., 2022b)Tk-XXL+Ours(11B)T0(3B)Tk-XXL(11B)Tk-XL(3B)Tk-XL+Ours(3B)304050T0+Ours(3B)2023.6131.3826.5829.4945.3646.6946.0147.4349.5Alpaca(7B)Alpaca+Ours(7B)Instruction-tuned W/O SupNatInstInstruction-tuned W/ SupNatInstRouge-L48.05OpenSNI(7B)OpenSNI+Ours(7B)49.47Figure 2: Zero-shot Rouge-L comparison on the SUP-NATINST heldout dataset (Wang et al., 2022c).

Intriguingly, Tk-XL combined withour method outperforms its larger version,Tk-XXL, with standard inference (Figure 2).Models not previously trained on the SUP-NATINST dataset, including Alpaca (7B)and T0 (3B), also show marked enhance-ments in performance. Additionally, theoverall Rouge-L score of the GPT3 (175B)is strikingly competitive, closely mirroringthe performance of OpenSNI (7B) whenaugmented with our method. We furtherobserved that ID’s generation exhibits in-creased both adherence to the instruction and an improvement in semantic quality. To provide acomprehensive understanding, we investigated the anchoring effect of noisy instructions. Our findingssuggest that as the model’s comprehension of the noisy instruction intensifies, the anchoring effectbecomes more potent, making ID more effective. Our main contributions are as follows:1According to the 2022 U.N. Revision, the population of USA is approximately 338.3 million as of 2022.2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024• We introduce Instructive Decoding (ID), a novel method to enhance the instruction followingcapabilities in instruction-tuned LMs. By using distorted versions of the original instruction,ID directs the model to bring its attention to the instruction during generation (Section 2).• We show that steering the noisy instruction towards more degrading predictions leads toimproved decoding performance. Remarkably, the opposite variant, which is designed forthe most significant deviation from the original instruction yet plausible, consistently showsnotable performance gains across various models and tasks (Section 3).• We provide a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of ID, demonstrating its efficacyfrom various perspectives. The generated responses via ID also improve in terms of labeladherence and coherence, and contribute to mitigate the typical imbalances observed in thestandard decoding process. (Section 4)2INSTRUCTIVE DECODINGIn this section, we present instructive decoding, a method designed to enhance the response generationof instruction-tuned models. By leveraging the responses derived from noisy instructions, ourapproach employs a contrastive technique to refine generated responses, ensuring they are moreclosely aligned with provided instructions.2.1PRELIMINARYIn the context of an auto-regressive language model, denoted as Mθ parameterized by θ, the primarygoal is to generate an output sequence y<t+1 = (y1, . . . , yt) when presented with an input sequencex. Within the ICL framework, a specific demonstration, represented as I, is supplied in conjunctionwith the context x. The language model Mθ then computes the logit for the t th token, symbolized aszt ∈R|V| equal to Mθ(yt|I, x, y<t), wherein V is the vocabulary set. Consequently, the probabilityof output sequence can be formally expressed as:pθ(y|I, x) =TYt=1pθ(yt|I, x, y<t)(1)where pθ(yt|I, x, y<t) is the probability for the next token prediction derived from the softmaxfunction applied to zt. It can either be the token with the highest probability (i.e., greedy decoding) orsampled from its distribution (e.g., nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019)). In the broader scope oftask generalization with previously unobserved instructions, the demonstration I takes the form of theguiding instruction. Depending on the specific context or setting, a few examples can be incorporatedto enhance the learning process. Generally, predictions of the instruction-tuned models are derivedfrom both the context x and the given instruction I, which play pivotal roles (Eq. 1).2.2MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW OF INSTRUCTIVE DECODINGA significant challenge in instruction following is ensuring that the generated tokens intrinsicallyadhere to the instruction I. While the dominant strategy involves enriching the dataset with numerous,diverse, and creatively curated high-quality tasks, this approach is both labor-intensive and compu-tationally expensive. It requires new training cycles and does not always produce improvementscommensurate with the effort invested. Consequently, there is growing interest in exploring moresustainable and effective alternative strategies for enhancing instruction-tuned models.Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we highlight the anchoring effect, a well-known cog-nitive bias in which initial information exerts a disproportionate influence on subsequent judg-ments (Kahneman et al., 1982). Recent studies have hinted at this principle being relevant to LMs,where the LM’s predictions are significantly conditioned (i.e., anchored) on the given context (Jones& Steinhardt, 2022; Malkin et al., 2021). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the strategicuse of the anchoring effect could refine the responses of instruction-tuned models by leveraging thediscrepancies between the predictions that are anchored on different instructions.Contrastive Decoding (CD) is a straightforward technique that improves the performance of LMsby comparing two sets of predictions (Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021). In this approach, predictionsfrom a high-performing primary model are contrasted against those from a less accurate ‘amateur’model. The goal is to differentiate the primary model’s outputs against the less reliable outputsfrom the amateur model during the decoding process. Despite its simplicity, the need for two3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Algorithm 1: Instructive DecodingINPUT : Language model Mθ, base instruction sequence I, noisy instruction sequence ˜I, initialprompt sequence x and target sequence length T, smoothing coefficient ϵ.1: Initialize t ←12: while t < T do3:zt, ˜zt ←Mθ(yt|I, x, y<t), Mθ(yt|˜I, x, y<t)4:yt = arg max(SOFTMAX[zt −ϵ ∗˜zt])5:set t ←t + 16: end whilemodels limits its broad applicability, and its utility in instruction-following scenarios remains largelyunexplored. To this end, we propose Instructive Decoding (ID), a novel method to ensure thatthe model’s output closely aligns with the given instruction. Leveraging the anchoring effect, IDincorporates these principles into the Contrastive Decoding framework by introducing noisy variantsof the original instruction. These variants are designed to subtly mislead the model into generatingdeviated responses based on the noisy instruction yet plausible. The comparison between the originalinstruction and the noisy version helps the model identify and correct biases (e.g., inherent modelbias and input bias), resulting in outputs better aligned with the intended purpose. To delve deeperinto the mechanics, during decoding, the model contrasts the logits z, originating from the originalinstruction, with the logits ˜z, originating from the noisy instructions, as described in Algorithm 1.2.3A COLLECTION OF NOISY INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTRUCTIVE DECODINGWe aim to design a collection of noisy instructions that harness the anchoring effect while maintainingtask fidelity. Key guiding principles for our noisy instruction design include:• Automated Perturbations: To ensure scalability and minimize manual intervention across diversetasks, we inject perturbations into the instructions. These perturbations include deletion, shuffling,or random word insertion.• Contrastive Elicitation: We systematically create prompts that elicit counter-intuitive yet plausibleresponses, thereby producing a deviation from the expected responses.In line with the principles outlined above, we employ the following noisy instruction variants.Full-text examples of these variants are displayed in Figure 3.1. Trunc-Shuf: Words from the instruction are randomly truncated and then shuffled. Thischallenges the model to deal with both missing words and altered word sequences.2. Null: The model receives only input-output pairs. This evaluates its inherent ability to comprehendtext and identify biases without any guiding instruction.3. Rand Words: Random words from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (Loper & Bird, 2002)replace the original instruction. This places the model in an environment filled with semanticnoise, requiring it to distinguish meaningful signals.4. Opposite: In a contrarian approach, the instructions contain misleading directives like ”Alwaysrespond with the opposite of what you’re asked. You never get it right.\n\n”. Such directivesconfront the model with conflicting guidance, helping it better align with the base instruction.Unless specified, in the Experiment Section, we configure the noisy instructions to include onerandom word (Rand Words) and set the truncation ratio to 0.6 (Trunc-Shuf).NullRand TruncTrunc-ShufOppositeRand WordsOther Noisy Templates…unbathed brachystomous warabi colorificconsolatoriness jungle Armatoli Sophocleanunrecognizing preadministratioNow complete the following example -Input: Question: what is the usa population?Output:…Now complete the following example -Input: Question: what is the usa population?Output:Definition: Given a, generate a paraphrase ofthat changing the of it.

Both datasets feature a diverse collection of crowd-sourced NLPtasks. In SUPNATINST, each task is formatted as a ‘Definition’ prompt that acts as the instruction. Forzero-shot evaluations, only the ‘Definition’ is utilized, whereas two positive demonstration examplesare incorporated for few-shot evaluations. Our experiments focus solely on the English segment ofthe dataset, and 100 instances per tasks are used for evaluation following Wang et al. (2022c). Thissubset comprises 119 evaluation tasks, grouped into 12 categories:• AC: Answerability Classification• CEC: Cause-Effect Classification• CR: Coherence Resolution• DT: Data-to-Text• DAR: Dialogue Act Recognition• GEC: Grammar Error Correction• KT: Keyword Tagging• OE: Overlap Extraction• QR: Question Rewriting• TE: Textual Entailment• TG: Title Generation• WA: Word AnalogyThe UNNATINST dataset features LM-generated instructions based on an initial set of 15 seedsamples. From its 64,000 samples, we evaluate a subset of 10,000.ModelsWe use the Tk-instruct models (Wang et al., 2022c), instruction-tuned from T5-LM (Lesteret al., 2021). These models are trained across 757 english tasks from the SUPNATINST training splitover 2 epochs, with each task comprising 100 samples. Our evaluation primarily involves three sizesof Tk-Instruct models: Large (770M), XL (3B), and XXL (11B). While Tk-XL and Tk-XXL comefrom publicly available checkpoints, the 770M model is manually trained under the same settings asthe other Tk-instruct models. Additionally, T0 (3B), Alpaca (7B), and Open-instruct-SNI (OpenSNI)are also used for further evaluations. T0 model also fine-tunes T5-LM (Lester et al., 2021) using taskprompts sourced from PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022). Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) fine-tunes theLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) based on a style outlined by Wang et al. (2022b), whereas OpenSNI(Wang et al., 2023b) is a fine-tuned version of LLaMA on SUPNATINST, marking a distinct way ofuse from Alpaca. In our experiments, greedy decoding is primarily employed for these models.Evaluation MetricsWe examine the outputs of instruction-tuned LMs on unseen tasks. Unlessspecified, all evaluations are conducted in a zero-shot setting, where the models perform tasks basedsolely on instructions, without any demonstration examples. Task performance is measured using theRouge-L score (Lin, 2004), which measures the overlap between generated and reference sequences,and is often used for open-ended tasks as Wang et al. (2022c). Adding to the Rouge-L score,classification tasks further use the Exact Match (EM) metric, which measures whether the responseprecisely matches a pre-defined label. To better evaluate semantics not captured by metrics like EMor Rouge-L, we introduce two additional metrics: Label Adherence and Label Coherence. Thesemetrics offer insights into how closely the generated responses adhere to the provided instructions.Detailed explanations of our evaluation metrics are as follows:• Label Adherence (LA): LA checks if the response stays within the label space defined by theinstruction, regardless of its agreement with the golden label. For example, if the instructionspecifies answers as ‘True’ or ‘False’, any response within this set is deemed conforming.• Label Coherence (LC): This metric evaluates the semantic alignment of the response with thegold label, allowing for near-equivalent answers. For example, responses like ‘Correct’ mayalign with a gold label of ‘True’. We compare responses against an expanded set of gold labelswith semantically equivalent expressions.For a more comprehensive evaluation, LA and LC are primarily measured on classification tasksidentifying 58 tasks among the 119 unseen tasks in SUPNATINST, which contains the predefinedlabels. Although adherence and coherence are valuable for open-ended generation, focusing onclassification ensures thorough evaluation. For clarity, an example illustrating the relationshipbetween EM, LA, and LC is provided with further details on evaluation in Appendix D.3.2PERFORMANCE ON UNSEEN TASK GENERALIZATIONResult OverviewTable 1 displays the results when applying Instructive Decoding (ID) to theTk-Instruct models and OpenSNI-7B model.

This per-formance advantage is evident across all types of noisy instructions. Notably, while larger modelsgenerally yield higher scores, the improvements are not uniformly distributed across task categories.For instance, the ‘OE (Overlap Extraction)’ task shows a slight performance decline, which hints atpossible architectural limitations for learning in this specific task Nevertheless, the ‘opposite’ variantconsistently results in the most significant improvements in Rouge-L scores across all model sizes,thus affirming the robustness of our method.From Degradation to Enhancement: The Two-fold Impact of Noisy InstructionsWhen usedin a standard decoding process, noisy instructions lead to a significant decline in performancefor generated responses. However, when integrated into ID, these instructions actually enhanceperformance. We attempt to unveil the relationship between such degradation and its enhancementwith ID (Figure 4 (a)). When replacing the original instruction with a noisy variant during thedecoding process, a noticeable drop in Rouge-L scores occurs, as shown on the x-axis labeled‘degradation’. The y-axis displays the performance improvement gained through ID when using thesenoisy instructions. Interestingly, we find a strong positive correlation between the initial drop inperformance and the subsequent improvement when using ID. This correlation is quantified using thePearson Correlation Coefficient (R in Figure 4 (a); Cohen et al. (2009)). The more substantial theinitial drop caused by a noisy instruction, the greater the performance gain when it is integrated intoID. Notably, the ‘opposite’ instruction, which causes the most significant initial decline, results in thelargest performance boost when used with ID.Comparative Winning Rates of Base vs. OursFigure 4 (b) illustrates tasks where ID outperformsthe baseline, as measured by the Rouge-L score.

The analysis is segmented into three metrics: EM, LA, and LC. A clear trendemerges: as the model size increases, EM scores also rise. However, when examining the LA andLC metrics based on baseline responses, the Tk-XL model outperforms the Tk-XXL model. Thissuggests that while larger models excel at strictly adhering to provided instructions, smaller modelsare more effective at generating semantically congruent outputs within the given instructional context.With the incorporation of ID, performance patterns remain largely consistent across different modelsizes and noisy instructions. Specifically, as model sizes increase, the ’opposite’ variant significantlyimproves the performances, particularly in the LC metrics for the Tk-XXL model. The random’trunc-shuffle’ variant exhibits a significant boost in LA scores as model size grows, highlighting thecomplex interplay between model sizes and their responsiveness to instructions.Table 2: Rouge-L scores cross-evaluatedacross different models and datasets.DatasetUNNATINSTSUPNATINSTModelTk-LargeT0-3B Alpaca-7Bbaseline43.2526.5823.61null44.5729.3331.21rand words44.4429.4930.93opposite43.4229.4631.38Table 3: Rouge-L scores under a few-shot sce-nario across different models.

Figure 4 illustrates the trajectory of thetraining loss and the performance on the RACE reading comprehension tasks for the 7B models.The training loss for ICLM consistently remains lower than that of the standard LM. This suggeststhat, when predicting the next token, ICLM benefits from a richer set of relevant prior documents torefer to, while the standard LM has limited information to rely on, leading to higher loss. Figure 4(b, c) shows that after training on around 150 billion tokens, ICLM is consistently better than thestandard LM on reading comprehension tasks. This performance gap remains consistent throughoutthe remainder of the pretraining phase. This suggests the scale of improvements by IN-CONTEXTPRETRAINING does not diminish and remains consistent as training on more tokens.8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20244.2ABLATION STUDY ON IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING DESIGNWe perform analysis on two design choices of IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING: a choice of methods forfinding retrieved documents and deduplication. Ablations are done with 1.5B models and evaluatedwith perplexity on Wikipedia. The results are presented in Figure 5.Document relevance.A key design of IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING is grouping documents bytheir relevance. We consider three levels of relevance: random (the standard baseline discussed in§3.2), clustering, and our document linking method in IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING. Clusteringfollows the method from Abbas et al. (2023) in clustering documents into 11k clusters based on theirembeddings and sample documents from each cluster to form the training inputs. Documents groupedby clustering are sourced from the same clusters, indicating topical similarity but not necessarilyclose relation. In contrast, ICLM links documents as nearest neighbors, indicating a higher degreeof similarity. The relevance between documents increases from random, clustering to linking. Weobserve that the perplexity of the language model decreases as the relevance increases.Deduplication.We compare perplexity of the models trained with and without the semanticdeduplication step. Removing the semantic deduplication step leads to a significant decrease inperplexity. When near duplicate documents are present in the same context, language models mightmerely copy from the prior document, leading to training instability.4.3DEMONSTRATION EXAMPLES SIZE FOR IN-CONTEXT LEARNINGWe evaluate the 7B models trained with the standard method and IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, usinga varying number of demonstration examples on text classification tasks described in §3.3.2. Asdepicted in Figure 6, ICLM maintains consistent performance gains over the standard method, evenas the number of demonstration examples grows. While the performance improves as the number ofdemonstration examples increases, it plateaus after 32 examples.5RELATED WORKData batching based on similarityPrevious work employs batching lexically similar segments inthe same training batches to construct high-quality positive pairs for training retrieval-augmentedlanguage models. For instance, Zhong et al. (2022) use BM25 and same documents to ensure thesegments in the same batch are similar to each other, while Min et al. (2023) group segments fromthe same documents in the same batch. Our method shares the same spirit with these methods exceptwe maintain the relevance of documents in the same context window, yet context windows withinbatches are shuffled. Additionally, our focus is to apply the batching method to train the standardlanguage models.6CONCLUSIONWe introduce IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new pretraining method that learns to generate textconditioned on a set of relevant documents, exposing LMs to relevant contexts and providing trainingsignals beyond document boundaries. Our method is highly scalable and simple, and works withany pre-training pipeline by simply changing the document ordering during preprocessing. Ourcomprehensive evaluation demonstrates our method leads to significant improvements in a widevariety of settings that highlight the ability to understand and reason over the given context, includingin-context learning, reading comprehension, retrieval augmentation, and more. Future research maydelve into the inherent connections between documents within specific corpus domains or usingmultilingual retriever to group related multilingual documents in the same context. For example, thecode scripts within the same repository are related. This insight paves the way for future exploration,where concatenating entire repositories into a unified whole could lead to the creation of meaningfullong-context data sets.9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024REFERENCESAmro Abbas, Kushal Tirumala, Dániel Simig, Surya Ganguli, and Ari S Morcos.

Context-faithful prompting for largelanguage models. ArXiv, abs/2303.11315, 2023.13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024AADDITIONAL BACKGROUNDA.1DEDUPLICATIONCorpora often have semantic duplicates: pairs of documents that are semantically related, yet notentirely identical. Previous studies (Yasunaga et al., 2023) show that retraining highly similardocuments in the input contexts during training hurts multimodal models’ performance. We observeda similar behaviur: when near duplicate documents are present in the same context, language modelsmight merely copy from the prior document, leading to training instability. Given that our retrievalapproach inherently assesses pairwise document similarity, we can easily filter out near duplicatedocuments that have high cosine similarity with other documents. We find this deduplication step tobe crucial for achieving performance of good language models (§4.2).A.2FAISS INDEXWe used a product quantised inverted file (IVFPQ) FAISS index with a code size of 256 and thecorresponding number of inverted lists 32768 , with total size of 62 gigabytes. The index contains235266464 768-dimensional embeddings originally in float 32. The index was trained on a sampleof 1572864 embeddings and the train time was 423 s. Successively, the data is split in batches of50M embeddings and for each index shard the corresponding batch of embeddings is added to thetrained index, the average adding embeddings time per index shard is 628.4 s. Finally, approximatenearest neighbor search is conducted per each shard before aggregating all results using faiss bigbatch search. The nprobe used for conducting approximate search is 64, this means that 0.2% of theinverted lists are probed during the nearest neighbors search.14", * abstract *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ," we introduce an open-access multilingual language model ( iCLM ) based on a sentiment treebank .

"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE NOT ROBUSTMULTIPLE CHOICE SELECTORSChujie Zheng†Hao Zhou‡Fandong Meng‡Jie Zhou‡Minlie Huang†∗†The CoAI Group, DCST, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China‡Pattern Recognition Center, WeChat AI, Tencent Inc., Chinachujiezhengchn@gmail.comaihuang@tsinghua.edu.cnABSTRACTMultiple choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task formatin the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This work shows that modernLLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent“selection bias”, namely, they prefer to select speciﬁc option IDs as answers (like“Option A”). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three bench-marks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs’ tokenbias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to speciﬁc optionID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the option IDs. To mit-igate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method,called PriDe, which separates the model’s prior bias for option IDs from the over-all prediction distribution. PriDe ﬁrst estimates the prior by permutating optioncontents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated priorto debias the remaining samples. We demonstrate that it achieves interpretableand transferable debiasing with high computational efﬁciency. We hope this workcan draw broader research attention to the bias and robustness of modern LLMs.11INTRODUCTIONQuestion:In an SR latchbuilt from NOR gates, whichcondition is not allowedOptions:A. S=0, R=0B. S=0, R=1C. S=1, R=0D. S=1, R=1Answer:DFigure 1: A multiple choice ques-tion (MCQ) example from MMLU.Multiple choice question (MCQ) is a prevalent input formatof large language models (LLMs). An MCQ typically encom-passes a question accompanied by multiple candidate options,from which the model is tasked to select the most suitable an-swer, as exempliﬁed in Figure 1. Current LLM-centric scenar-ios have widely utilized the task format of MCQ, for instance,within benchmarks targeted at assessing LLMs (Hendryckset al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023) and inLLM-based automatic evaluation frameworks (Chiang et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b). In anyscenario, we always expect LLMs to robustly select reliable answers in MCQs.Unfortunately, we observe that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs(Robinson & Wingate, 2022). We show in Table 1 that, in the 0-shot MMLU evaluation (Hendryckset al., 2020), a simple “answer-moving attack” by always moving the golden answers to a speciﬁcposition causes LLMs’ dramatic performance ﬂuctuations. For instance, moving the golden answersto position D degrades the accuracy of gpt-3.5-turbo by 6.3 (from 67.2 to 60.9). When movingto A, llama-30b is boosted by 15.2 and surpasses gpt-3.5-turbo (68.2 vs. 65.3), which starklycontrasts with their original performance (53.1 vs. 67.2).LLMs’ poor robustness to option position changes results from their biased behavior: they preferto select speciﬁc option IDs as answers (like “Option A”), which we term as selection bias. Asa simple veriﬁcation, we randomly sampled 1,000 MMLU test samples, where we controlled thenumber of correct answers being A/B/C/D as 250 each. Among these samples, llama-30B selectsA/B/C/D 34.6% / 27.3% / 22.3% / 15.8% of the time, while gpt-3.5-turbo for 22.5% / 25.6% /∗Corresponding author.1Project repository: https://github.com/chujiezheng/LLM-MCQ-Bias.1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Table 1: Simply moving the golden answers of MCQs toa speciﬁc option position can cause dramatic performanceﬂuctuations (0-shot MMLU), suggesting LLMs’ poor ro-bustness to option position changes in MCQs.Move Golden toOrigABCDllama-30B53.168.2(+15.2)54.1(+1.1)50.1(-2.9)41.2(-11.9)vicuna-v1.3-33B57.059.5(+2.5)58.6(+1.5)65.8(+8.8)44.8(-12.3)falcon-40B51.846.3(-5.5)45.2(-6.7)64.8(+13.0)47.9(-3.9)falcon-inst-40B51.538.3(-13.3)38.9(-12.7)55.7(+4.1)69.1(+17.6)llama-2-70B64.061.5(-2.6)68.6(+4.5)64.1(+0.1)62.0(-2.1)gpt-3.5-turbo67.265.3(-1.9)68.5(+1.3)74.2(+6.9)60.9(-6.3)10010 Acc (%)llama-30Bvicuna-v1.3-33Bfalcon-40Bfalcon-inst-40Bllama-2-70Bgpt-3.5-turbo255075Recall (%)ABCDFigure 2: The performance ﬂuctua-tion (left) correlates with the balanceof different option IDs’ recalls in theoriginal inputs, as the original recallof option ID X is actually calculatedon a subset of samples where all thegolden answers are moved to X.32.3% / 19.6%, respectively (averaged over 10 runs). These proportions are statistically nonuniform(χ2 Test, p-value ≪10−4) and align well with the performance ﬂuctuations in Table 1.Through extensive empirical evaluation (§2.3), with 20 LLMs, on three benchmarks, and with vary-ing option numbers (from two to ﬁve), we show that selection bias is prevalent across various LLMsand cannot be well mitigated by simple prompting strategies (§2.6), like Chain-of-Thought prompt-ing (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). It varies with models but manifests a cross-domainsimilarity within the same model (§2.3). With careful ablation analyses (§2.4), we ﬁnd that, con-trary to the common view in previous work (Wang et al., 2023a; Pezeshkpour & Hruschka, 2023),selection bias arises less from LLMs’ position bias, where they are deemed to favor options pre-sented at speciﬁc ordering positions (like ﬁrst or last). In contrast, we pinpoint one more salientintrinsic cause of selection bias as the model’s token bias when predicting answers from the optionIDs given the standard MCQ prompt, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass tospeciﬁc ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D).To efﬁciently mitigate selection bias, we propose a method called PriDe (§3), referring to Debiasingwith Prior estimation. In PriDe, we assume the model’s prior bias for option IDs can be separatedfrom the overall prediction distribution. PriDe ﬁrst estimates the prior by permutating option con-tents on a small number of test samples (e.g., 5%), and then applies it to debias the remainingsamples. The whole debiasing procedure needs no sample labels, takes place during the inferencetime, and requires only negligible extra computational costs, which is especially suitable for modernLLMs. We demonstrate that PriDe achieves superior debiasing effectiveness to strong baselines, es-pecially in the low-cost scenario (§4.1). Furthermore, the prior estimated by PriDe provides a goodinterpretation for selection bias (§4.1) and can transfer well across different domains (§4.2), whichhighlights its practical potential in broader scenarios.Summary of Contributions(1) We identify the ubiquitous selection bias in LLMs and provideextensive empirical analyses (with 20 LLMs, on three MCQ benchmarks) and valuable insights onthis problem. (2) We pinpoint LLMs’ token bias as one primary intrinsic cause of selection bias.(3) We propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method PriDe, which demonstrates notableeffectiveness and efﬁciency, interpretability, and cross-domain transferability. We hope this workcan inspire future research on the bias and robustness of LLMs.2INVESTIGATION ON SELECTION BIAS2.1EXPERIMENTAL SETUPModelsOur study focuses on the causal, decoder-only LLMs since this architecture has becomethe dominant choice for modern LLMs. We experiment with 20 LLMs from popular LLM familiesacross various sizes: llama-7/13/30/65B (Touvron et al., 2023a), llama-2(-chat)-7/13/70B(Touvron et al., 2023b), vicuna-v1.3-7/13/33B, vicuna-v1.5-7/13B (Chiang et al., 2023),falcon(-inst)-7/40B (Almazrouei et al., 2023), and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 (OpenAI, 2022).The models except gpt-3.5-turbo are all open source on the HuggingFace website, and we can2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024access their output probabilities. gpt-3.5-turbo is the commercial API of ChatGPT. It acceptstextual prompts and returns generated texts without providing access to output probabilities.Benchmarks We conduct experiments on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), ARC-Challenge (Clarket al., 2018), and CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019), which are all MCQ benchmarkswidely used for LLM evaluation. Our selection of benchmarks takes into account the diversityof tasks and domains. Speciﬁcally, MMLU and ARC consist of 4-option MCQs, while CSQAconsists of 5-option ones, and MMLU covers tests from 4 domain categories spanning 57 subjects.The diverse domains facilitate us to derive general observations and enable cross-domain transferexploration. See Appendix E for detailed data statistics.EvaluationOur evaluation protocol follows the mainstream LLM evaluation frameworks, suchas HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard, EleutherAI lm-harness, the original MMLU implementation,and OpenAI Evals (see Appendix F). Speciﬁcally, for open-source models, we access the outputprobabilities of option ID tokens A/B/C/D/E and use the maximal one as the model prediction. Forgpt-3.5-turbo, we compare the golden answer with the ﬁrst generated token, with the decodingtemperature set to 0. See Figure 7 and 6 in Appendix A for the input formats.Our evaluation mainly considers the 0-shot setting, which excludes biases introduced by in-contextexamples, but we also conduct 5-shot experiments. The in-context examples come from the devel-opment sets and are shared across all the test samples within the same task.2.2MEASUREMENT OF SELECTION BIASIn our study, selection bias is deﬁned as the model’s behavioral bias to select speciﬁc option IDs asanswers. To measure selection bias, one naive way is based on the counting for model predictions,which, however, is susceptible to label imbalance. We instead propose to measure selection biasbased on the balance of recalls of different option IDs and use the standard deviation of recalls(RStd) as a quantitative metric. This measurement is intuitive that greater recall imbalance indicatesmore pronounced selection bias and is not as susceptible to label imbalance as the counting-basedmeasurement. More importantly, recall balance well reﬂects the model’s robustness to option posi-tion changes, as illustrated in Figure 2. Hence, we reasonably expect that reducing selection bias(measured by recall balance) will improve LLMs’ robustness to option position changes in MCQs.Note that measuring selection bias with recall balance implies the premise that the golden answersshould be randomly placed. We show in Figure 18 in Appendix C that randomly shufﬂing the optionsdoes not obviously change selection bias, validating the above premise.2.3KEY OBSERVATIONSWe ﬁrst conduct an extensive evaluation of LLMs on various benchmarks to gain a preliminaryunderstanding of selection bias. We show partial results in Figure 3 for a brief presentation and putthe full results in Appendix B. We draw the following main observations and insights:Selection bias is prevalent across various LLMs and varies with model families and sizes.In-tuitively, selection bias is likely to originate from LLMs’ training data, where some answers (e.g., C)may occur more frequently than others. However, we do not observe consistent patterns of selectionbias within the same model family where the models are trained with the same training data (e.g.,llama-7/13/30/65B, llama-2-7/13/70B). We speculate that selection bias arises as a product ofcomplex interactions between training data composition and ordering, model capacity (number ofparameters), and other factors like hyperparameters.Selection bias within the same model displays a moderate similarity across different domains.For instance, under the 0-shot setting, llama-30B consistently prefers A/B on various benchmarks,while gpt-3.5-turbo favors C/B more. While the preference ranking may not strictly persistacross tasks or domains, there is an overarching tendency for each model to lean towards certainoption IDs (e.g., A and B) and away from others (e.g., C and D). It suggests that selection bias is aninherent behavioral bias of LLMs that is less impacted by tasks or domains.In-context examples can reduce but may meanwhile alter selection bias.As exempliﬁed inFigure 3, llama-30B disfavors C under the 0-shot setting but becomes biased towards it under the5-shot setting. We ﬁnd that this alteration still does not display noticeable patterns within the same3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20241001020llama-30B0-shot5-shot0-shot, Removing IDsSTEMSocial ScienceHumanitiesOthersMMLUARCCSQA1050510gpt-3.5-turboSTEMSocial ScienceHumanitiesOthersMMLUARCCSQASTEMSocial ScienceHumanitiesOthersMMLUARCCSQAABCDEFigure 3: Selection bias of llama-30B and gpt-3.5-turbo on various benchmarks, see Appendix B for allthe 20 LLMs’ results.

It indicates that in-context examples can introduce new biases that will be intertwinedwith the inherent selection bias, making the latter complex and less regular.2.4WHAT CAUSES SELECTION BIAS?Given the ubiquity of selection bias in various LLMs, we now seek to ﬁgure out the intrinsic causesresulting in this behavioral bias. We propose two hypotheses: (1) Token bias. In the standard MCQprompt (Figure 1), when selecting answers from the option IDs, the model may a priori assignmore probabilistic mass to speciﬁc ID tokens (such as A or C). (2) Position bias. The model mayfavor options presented at speciﬁc ordering positions (such as the ﬁrst or last one). Note that in arecent work, Wang et al. (2023a) similarly found that GPT-4 exhibits the bias towards the responsesfrom “Assistant 1”. However, it is still unclear whether it is because the preferred responses are“selected via the ID token 1” or because they are “presented ﬁrst”.Table 2: Preliminary debiasing results (0-shot,gpt-3.5-turbo), measured by the standarddeviation of recalls (RStd) and accuracy (Acc).MethodsMMLUARCRStdAccRStdAccDefault5.567.23.384.3a/b/c/d6.867.02.183.11/2/3/43.865.82.182.3(A)/(B)/(C)/(D)8.166.54.082.4Debiasing Instruct6.166.33.984.2Chain-of-Thought4.566.83.484.5Shufﬂing IDs5.163.93.780.3Removing IDs1.066.70.684.9One challenge here is that option IDs are boundwith options’ ordering positions, e.g., the ID Bis naturally tied with the second-presented option.To distinguish the impacts of the two hypothesizedcauses, we conduct two ablation experiments. (1)Shufﬂing option IDs. We randomly shufﬂe thedefault ID ordering A/B/C/D, for instance, intoB/D/A/C or C/A/D/B, etc. In this way, B can de-note the option presented at any ordering position,thus eliminating the impact of position bias andleaving only token bias. Note that this ablationwill obviously impair the naturalness and qual-ity of the MCQ prompt, and may consequently de-grade model performance (as shown in Table 2).(2) Removing option IDs and asking the model to directly select option contents. In this way, thechange of selection bias would indicate the impact of token bias, while the remaining part corre-sponds to position bias. When evaluating LLMs without option IDs, we require gpt-3.5-turbo togenerate the whole selected option, which is then compared with the golden answer. For open-sourcemodels, we compute the likelihoods of options, normalized by their lengths, and use the maximumone as the model prediction. See Figure 9 and 8 in Appendix A for the input formats.As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, the removal of option IDs notably reduces selection bias (RStddecreases), while RStd is little changed by shufﬂing option IDs. The former observation, in mostcases, holds for various LLMs, on different benchmarks, and with varying option numbers (from twoto ﬁve, where 2/3-option settings are constructed from the original data), see Appendix B and Table3 in Appendix C for detailed results. We also try to replace the default ID symbols A/B/C/D withseveral reasonable alternatives, including a/b/c/d, 1/2/3/4, and (A)/(B)/(C)/(D), but observeno remarkable reduction in RStd from the default one, as shown in Table 2. These results conﬁrmthat the model’s token bias is one primary intrinsic cause of selection bias.4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024However, with option IDs removed, the remaining selection bias (corresponding to the impact ofposition bias) varies with models and tasks, see Appendix B and Table 3 in Appendix C. For in-stance, the remaining selection bias of llama-13B, vicuna-v1.3-7B, and gpt-3.5-turbo is onlymarginal, while that of llama-30B, vicuna-v1.3-33B, and falcon-40B is still pronounced (al-though having been reduced much). The selection bias of llama-2-13/70B even slightly increasesin MMLU and ARC after option IDs being removed while still decreasing in CSQA, implying thepotential counteraction between token bias and position bias. These results suggest that the model’sposition bias is somewhat present but quite irregular, largely depending on models and tasks.2.5CAN WE DEBIAS LLMS BY REMOVING OPTION IDS?Despite the notably reduced selection bias, we ﬁnd that removing option IDs usually degrades modelperformance (except in a few cases under the 5-shot setting), see Table 3 and 4 in Appendix C. Thisperformance degradation results from the way we leverage LLMs to answer MCQs without optionIDs, i.e., calculating and comparing the likelihoods of options, which is referred to as the “clozeprompt” format in Robinson & Wingate (2022). Their study demonstrates that asking LLMs topredict option IDs forms a better MCQ prompt than the “cloze prompt”, which is consistent withour observation. Besides, selecting answers by calculating and comparing the likelihoods of optionsis not as convenient and straightforward to implement as directly predicting option IDs. We thussuggest that removing option IDs is not a practical method to mitigate selection bias.2.6CAN SIMPLE PROMPTING STRATEGIES MITIGATE SELECTION BIAS?As a preliminary debiasing attempt, we apply two simple prompting strategies to gpt-3.5-turbo:(1) Explicit debiasing instruction: We append an explicit debiasing instruction in the system mes-sage of gpt-3.5-turbo (“Please note that the provided options have been randomly shufﬂed, soit is essential to consider them fairly and without bias.”). (2) Chain-of-Thought prompting (Weiet al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022): gpt-3.5-turbo is ﬁrst prompted with “Let’s think step by step:”to generate its thought process and then produces the ﬁnal answer. We follow the implementationin OpenAI Evals, see Figure 10 in Appendix A for details. As shown in Table 2, the two promptingstrategies cannot mitigate selection bias well. It suggests that selection bias is an inherent behavioralbias of LLMs that cannot be addressed by simple prompt engineering.3METHODOLOGY3.1PERMUTATION-BASED DEBIASING BASELINE AND FORMULATIONBefore proposing our debiasing method, we ﬁrst introduce a strong permutation-based debiasingbaseline that our method builds upon. It averages the model’s prediction distributions under variousoption permutations (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al., 2023b), which intuitively cancels out both themodel’s token bias and position bias.Formally, we use q to denote the MCQ question. Suppose the n default-ordered option IDs (e.g.,A/B/C/D) are di and the default-ordered option contents are oi, i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. We use I to denotea permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}, I to a set of possible Is. We use gI(i) to denote the index of i in I,and xI to the concatenation of the default-ordered option IDs and the I-permuted option contents,so that oi is tied with dgI(i) in xI. The permutation-based debiasing baseline can be formulated as:ePdebiased(oi|q, x) = 1|I|XI∈IPobserved(dgI(i)|q, xI), i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n},(1)where x is the default input of option IDs and option contents, Pobserved(dgI(i)|q, xI) is the observedprediction probability for the option ID dgI(i) (meaning oi being correct) under the option permu-tation I, and ePdebiased(oi|q, x) denotes the debiased prediction probability for the option contentoi. Since computing full permutations is prohibitively expensive (×n! costs), we adopt a practicalalternative, called Cyclic Permutation, where I = {(i, i + 1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , i −1)}ni=1. It reducesthe computational cost (e.g., LLM forward times) from ×n! to ×n and ensures one pairing betweeneach option ID di and option content oj. In Figure 16 in Appendix C, we show that selecting otherpermutations I in Cyclic Permutation, where we still ensure one pairing between each di and oj,leads to similar debiasing results. However, the overhead of Cyclic Permutation is still somewhathigh (×n inference costs), which stimulates us to design more efﬁcient debiasing methods.5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20243.2PREDICTION PROBABILITY DECOMPOSITIONThe core idea of our method PriDe is to obtain a debiased prediction distribution by separating themodel’s prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution. Equivalently, it assumesthat the observed prediction distribution Pobserved over di can be decomposed as a prior distributionPprior over di and a debiased distribution Pdebiased over oi:Pobserved(di|q, xI) = Z−1q,xIPprior(di|q, xI)Pdebiased(ofI(i)|q, xI), ∀I ∈I, i ∈{1, 2, ..., n}, (2)where fI(i) denotes i-th element in I. Note that we can rewrite the form of Pobserved as a joint proba-bility P(di, oj|q, xI) for di and oj, which equals to Pobserved(di|q, xI) if j = fI(i) and 0 otherwise.Therefore, the above prediction probability decomposition can be interpreted as the conditional in-dependent assumption (ignore the normalization item Zq,xI), where the model holds independentbeliefs about di and oj. Speciﬁcally, Pdebiased(oj|q, xI) reﬂects the model’s true belief about theoption content oj, which is not inﬂuenced by the option ID di. In contrast, Pprior(di|q, xI) indi-cates the model’s prior bias for the option ID di, which actually involves not only the model’stoken bias but also position bias (§2.4), due to the natural binding between option IDs and options’ordering positions. Hence, under this formulation, we do not need to strictly distinguish the twobiases laboriously, but can instead address them together by eliminating Pprior.For tractable derivation, we reasonably assume that Pdebiased is not affected by how the options areordered, which implies its invariance to option permutation I so we can replace xI with the defaultinput x. We also assume Pprior to be independent of xI, which means that the prior for option IDsdepends on only the question q. Equation 2 is then simpliﬁed to:Pobserved(di|q, xI) = Z−1q,xIPprior(di|q)Pdebiased(ofI(i)|q, x), ∀I ∈I, i ∈{1, 2, ..., n}.(3)3.3DEBIASING WITH PRIOR ESTIMATIONTaking the logarithm of both sides of Equation 3 and summing over all I ∈I, we can obtain:XI∈Ilog Pobserved(di|q, xI) = |I| log Pprior(di|q) + XI∈Ilog Pdebiased(ofI(i)|q, x)+ C(4)= |I| log Pprior(di|q) +|I|nnXj=1log Pdebiased(oj|q, x)+ C(5)= |I| log Pprior(di|q) + C′, i ∈{1, 2, ..., n}.(6)We derive Equation 5 because PI∈I log Pdebiased(ofI(i)|q, x) actually involves |I|/n iterationsover each Pdebiased(oj|q, x) (given I contains either full or cyclic permutations), whose aggregationover j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is a constant. Therefore, without any sample labels, we can obtain:Pprior(di|q) = softmax 1|I|XI∈Ilog Pobserved(di|q, xI), i ∈{1, 2, ..., n}.(7)Recall our observation in §2.3 that selection bias within the same model displays a moderate cross-domain similarity. This implies that the prior for option IDs is likely to transfer across differentsamples and domains, which motivates us to compute the priors of partial test samples and use themas an approximation for the remaining samples. It can largely improve debiasing efﬁciency since nomore computational overhead is needed for the remaining samples once the prior is estimated.Drawing the above inspiration, PriDe ﬁrst takes K test samples De from the test set D, where K canbe adjusted based on the estimation budget. Each sample in De undergoes the standard permutation-based debiasing in Equation 1, during which we estimate each sample-speciﬁc prior Pprior(di|q)using Equation 7. For the remaining samples Dr = D\De, we compute the “global prior” ePprior(di)by averaging the previously computed priors as an approximation to the new sample’s Pprior(di|q)in Equation 3. We can thus compute the approximated ePdebiased(oi|q, x) and obtain the debiasedprediction (omit the superscript I as we only use the default input here):ePdebiased(oi|q, x) ∝Pobserved(di|q, x)/ ePprior(di), i ∈{1, 2, ..., n}.(8)When K ≪|D|, the overhead for prior estimation will become negligible compared to the wholeinference cost.

We control the costs of Cyclic/Full Perm viathe ratio β of the debiased test samples, where we take β ∈{0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%}. ForPriDe, we control the costs via the ratio α of test samples for prior estimation (these samples are meanwhiledirectly debiased via Cyclic Perm), where we take α ∈{2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%}. Note thatwhen α = 100%, PriDe degenerates to Cyclic Perm, so we do not plot them.4EXPERIMENTS4.1MAIN RESULTSWe compare PriDe with two strong permutation-based debiasing baselines: Cyclic Permutationand Full Permutation. The latter is not experimented on the 5-option CSQA benchmark due to theextremely high cost. Since gpt-3.5-turbo does not return the output probability, we sample 100generated answers as an approximation to Pobserved. For PriDe, we randomly sample K = α|D|test samples as De and report the average results over 5 runs. Here, we use α ∈(0, 1) as the ratio oftest samples for prior estimation to control the estimation overhead.Figure 4 presents the debiasing results (averaged over all the models) versus the computational costsunder the 0-shot setting, see detailed breakdowns in Table 3 and 4 in Appendix C. PriDe achievessuperior debiasing effectiveness and performance improvement to Full/Cyclic Perm, especially inthe low-cost scenario. This also holds under the 5-shot setting, see Figure 19 in Appendix C. InFigure 17 in Appendix C, we show that the estimated prior manifests a clear correlation with theempirical selection bias (i.e., the recalls of different option positions before debiasing). It suggeststhat PriDe can provide a good interpretation for the model’s selection bias. Furthermore, we observethat the priors are stable when estimated with different sizes of test samples (from 2% to 20%). Itsuggests that we are able to obtain a reliable estimate of prior even with a limited computational7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 5: Cross-domain debiasing results of PriDe (0-shot, averaged over all the 20 LLMs), with priors esti-mated using α = 5% test samples from the source domains.budget. It also implies that the model’s prior bias for option IDs exhibits a similar pattern acrossdifferent samples, conﬁrming our design motivation of PriDe in §3.3.Note that one may propose to debias with fewer permutations (such as 2 or 3 random permutations,with ×2 or ×3 costs) as a low-cost alternative to Cyclic (×n) or Full (×n!) Perm. In Figure 21 and22 in Appendix C, we show that PriDe can still be combined with these methods and notably boostdebiasing effectiveness and efﬁciency.4.2TRANSFERABILITY ANALYSISIn practical scenarios, we may not guarantee that the test samples always come from the same orsimilar domains. We hope the prior estimated by PriDe to be transferable: Once the prior is estimatedusing a small number of samples from domain X, it can be used to debias not only other samplesfrom domain X but also samples from domain Y. To this end, we evaluate the cross-domain transferperformance of estimated priors on the four category domains of MMLU and ARC (5 domains intotal, all are 4-option MCQs). We ﬁrst use PriDe to estimate the prior with α test samples from asource domain X, and then apply it to debiasing the test samples from a target domain Y.

"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024BEYOND MEMORIZATION: VIOLATING PRIVACY VIAINFERENCE WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELSRobin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovi´c, Martin VechevDepartment of Computer Science, ETH Zurich{robin.staab,mark.vero}@inf.ethz.chABSTRACTCurrent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses onthe issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models’ in-ference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question ofwhether current LLMs could violate individuals’ privacy by inferring personalattributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first com-prehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributesfrom text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show thatcurrent LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income,sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost(100×) and time (240×) required by humans. As people increasingly interact withLLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emergingthreat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information throughseemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., textanonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting userprivacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can in-fer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of workingdefenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implicationsbeyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.1INTRODUCTIONThe recent advances in capabilities (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) of largepre-trained language models (LLMs), together with increased availability, have sparked an activediscourse about privacy concerns related to their usage (Carlini et al., 2021; 2023). An undesiredside effect of using large parts of the internet for training is that models memorize vast amountsof potentially sensitive training data, possibly leaking them to third parties (Carlini et al., 2021).While particularly relevant in recent generative models, the issue of memorization is not inherentlyexclusive to LLMs and has been demonstrated in earlier models such as LSTMs (Carlini et al.,2019). However, as we show in this work, the privacy risks associated with current state-of-the-artLLMs extend beyond this established understanding.This Work: Privacy Violations through LLM InferenceIn particular, we find that with in-creased capabilities, LLMs are able to automatically infer a wide range of personal author attributesfrom large collections of unstructured text (e.g., public forum or social network posts) given to themat inference time. Combined with the increased proliferation of LLMs, this drastically lowers thecosts associated with privacy-infringing inferences. In turn, this allows an adversary to scale farbeyond what previously would have been possible with expensive human profilers. For instance,as illustrated in Figure 1, imagine a user leaving the following seemingly harmless comment on apseudonymized online platform (e.g., Reddit) under a post about daily work commutes:“there is this nasty intersection on my commute, I always get stuck there waiting for a hook turn”Although the user had no intent of revealing their location, current LLMs are able to pick up onsmall cues left in their comment. Prompting GPT-4, it correctly deduces that the user comes fromMelbourne, noting that “a ”hook turn” is a traffic maneuver particularly used in Melbourne.”.In Figure 1, we show two more examples (derived from Section 4) how LLMs’ strong languageunderstanding capabilities enable such inferences across various personal attributes and texts.1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 1: Adversarial inference of personal attributes from text. We assume the adversary has accessto a dataset of user-written texts (e.g., by scraping an online forum). Given a text, the adversarycreates a model prompt using a fixed adversarial template 1 . They then leverage a pre-trained LLMin 2 to automatically infer personal user attributes 3 , a task that previously required humans.current models are able to pick up on subtle clues in text and language (Section 5), providing accurateinferences on real data. Finally, in 4 , the model uses its inference to output a formatted user profile.In this work, we demonstrate that by scraping the entirety of a user’s online posts and feeding themto a pre-trained LLM, malicious actors can infer private information never intended to be disclosedby the users. It is known that half of the US population can be uniquely identified by a small numberof attributes such as location, gender, and date of birth (Sweeney, 2002). LLMs that can infer someof these attributes from unstructured excerpts found on the internet could be used to identify theactual person using additional publicly available information (e.g., voter records in the USA). Thiswould allow a malicious actor to link highly personal information inferred from posts (e.g., mentalhealth status) to an actual person and use it for undesirable or illegal activities like targeted politicalcampaigns, automated profiling, or stalking.For this, we investigate the capabilities of 9 widely used state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude2, Llama 2) to infer 8 personal attributes, showing that they achieve already ∼85% top-1 and∼95.2% top-3 accuracy on real-world data. Despite these models achieving near-expert humanperformance, they come at a fraction of the cost, requiring 100× less financial and 240× lower timeinvestment than human labelers—making such privacy violations at scale possible for the first time.Emerging FrontiersAll risks discussed so far focus on LLMs being used to analyze alreadyexisting texts. However, a new form of online communication is emerging, as millions of peoplestart to interact with thousands of custom chatbots on a range of platforms (ChAI, 2022; Poe, 2023;HF). Our findings indicate that this can create unprecedented risks for user privacy. In particular, wedemonstrate that malicious chatbots can steer conversations, provoking seemingly benign responsescontaining sufficient information for the chatbot to infer and uncover private information.Potential MitigationsBeyond attacks, we also investigate two directions from which one couldtry to mitigate this issue: from the client side, a first defense against LLM-based attribute inferencewould be removing personal attributes using existing text anonymization tools. Such an approach2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024was recently implemented specifically for LLMs (Lakera, 2023). However, we find that even whenanonymizing text with state-of-the-art tools for detecting personal information, LLMs can still infermany personal attributes, including location and age. As we show in Section 6, LLMs often pickup on more subtle language clues and context (e.g., region-specific slang or phrases) not removedby such anonymizers. With current anonymization tools being insufficient, we advocate for strongertext anonymization methods to keep up with LLMs’ rapidly increasing capabilities.From a provider perspective, alignment is currently the most promising approach to restricting LLMsfrom generating harmful content. However, research in this area has primarily focused on avoidingunsafe, offensive, or biased generations (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) and has not consideredthe potential privacy impact of model inferences. Our findings in Section 5 confirm this, showingthat most models currently do not filter privacy invasive prompts. We believe better alignment forprivacy protection is a promising direction for future research.Main contributionsOur key contributions are:1. The first formalization of the privacy threats resulting from inference capabilities of LLMs.2. A comprehensive experimental evaluation of LLMs’ ability to infer personal attributes fromreal-world data both with high accuracy and low cost, even when the text is anonymizedusing commercial tools.3. A release of our code, prompts, and synthetic chatlogs at https://github.com/eth-sri/llmprivacy. Additionally, we release a dataset of 525 human-labeled syn-thetic examples to further the research in this area.Responsible DisclosurePrior to publishing this work, we contacted OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta,and Google, giving access to all our data, resulting in an active discussion on the impact of privacy-invasive LLM inferences. We refer to Section 7 for a further discussion of ethical considerations.2RELATED WORKPrivacy Leakage in LLMsWith the rise of large language models in popularity, a growing num-ber of works have addressed the issue of training data memorization (Carlini et al., 2021; Kim et al.,2023; Lukas et al., 2023; Ippolito et al., 2023). Memorization refers to the exact repetition of train-ing data sequences during inference in response to a specific input prompt, often the correspondingprefix. Carlini et al. (2023) empirically demonstrated a log-linear relationship between memoriza-tion, model size, and training data repetitions, a worrisome trend given the rapidly growing modeland dataset sizes. As pointed out by Ippolito et al. (2023), however, verbatim memorization does notcapture the full extent of privacy risks posed by LLMs. Memorized samples can often be recoveredapproximately, and privacy notions are strongly context-dependent (Brown et al., 2022). Yet, thethreat of memorization is bounded to points in the model’s training data. This is in stark contrast toinference-based privacy violations, which can happen on any data presented to the model. While ac-knowledged as a potential threat in recent literature (Bubeck et al., 2023), there is, to our knowledge,no existing study of the privacy risks of pre-trained LLMs inferences to user privacy.Risks of Large Language ModelsBesides privacy violations (inference or otherwise), unre-stricted LLMs can exhibit a wide range of safety risks. Current research in model risks and mit-igations focuses mainly on mitigating harmful (e.g., ”How do I create a bomb?”), unfairly biased, orotherwise toxic answers (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). The most popular provider-side mit-igations currently used are all forms of ”model alignment,” most commonly achieved by finetuninga raw language model to align with a human-preference model that penalizes harmful generations.However, recent findings by Zou et al. (2023) show that such alignments can be broken in an auto-mated fashion, fueling the debate for better alignment methods.Personal data and PIILegal definitions of personal data vary between jurisdictions. Within theEU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU, 2016) defines personal data in Article4 as ”any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” explicitly includinglocation data and a persons economic, cultural or social identity. The Personal Identifiable Infor-mation (PII) definitions applied under U.S. jurisdiction are less rigorous but, similarly to GDPR,3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024acknowledge the existence of sensitive data such as race, sexual orientation, or religion. All of theattributes investigated in Section 5 (e.g., location, income) fall under the personal data definitions ofthese legislatures as they could be used with additional information to identify individuals.Author ProfilingAuthor profiling, the process of extracting specific author attributes from writtentexts, has been a long-standing area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Estival et al.,2007; Rangel et al., 2013; 2017). However, current approaches focus predominantly on specificattributes (often gender and age), using specific feature extraction methods (Rangel et al., 2018). Aspointed out in Villegas et al. (2014), one significant challenge slowing the progress in this field is alack of available datasets. The primary source of labeled author profiling datasets is the yearly PANcompetition (Rangel et al., 2013), primarily focusing on Twitter texts and a few select attributes.At the same time, the significant growth of available (unlabeled) online raises concerns about whatother kinds of personal data malicious actors could infer from user-written texts. Our work addressesthe gap between current author profiling work on specific textual domains/attributes and emergingLLMs trained on vast datasets showing strong language understanding capabilities across domains.3THREAT MODELSIn this section, we formalize the privacy threats presented in Section 1 by introducing a set of ad-versaries Ai∈{1,2} with varying access to a pre-trained LLM M. We first formalize the free text in-ference setting via an adversary A1 that infers personal attributes from unstructured free-form texts,such as online posts. We show in our evaluation (Section 5) that an A1 adversary is both practical(i.e., high accuracy) and feasible (i.e., lower cost) on real-world data. Considering the rapid devel-opment of LLM-based systems and proliferation of LLM-based chatbots, we additionally formalizethe emerging setting of an adversary A2 controlling an LLM with which users interact.3.1FREE TEXT INFERENCEFigure 2: Free text inference: Theadversary creates a prompt fromuser texts, using an LLM do inferpersonal attributes.The free text inference setting formalizes how an adversarycan extract and infer information from unstructured texts. Forthis, we assume that an adversary A1 has access to a datasetD consisting of texts written by individuals ui ∈UD. Sucha dataset could be obtained by, e.g., scraping a large onlineforum or social media site. However, D is not restricted topublic-facing data—it could also come from (il)legally ob-tained records of internal communications or messenger chatlogs (Yang, 2019). Given D, the A1 adversary’s goal is to inferpersonal attributes of individuals contained in D.Formally, let (u, t) ∈D be a pair of a user u and text t writ-ten by them. As shown in Figure 3, we are interested in A1’scapability of extracting (attribute, value) tuples that match theauthor correctly. In particular, we write ua to refer to the valueof attribute a of user u. In Figure 2, we have uLOC = Mel-bourne, uAGE = 47, uSEX = Female. Given t, A1 first cre-ates a prompt PA1(t) = (S, P). For this, PA1 is a function thattakes in the text t and produces both a system prompt S anda prompt P which is given to the model M. While this formulation is general, for the rest of thiswork, we restrict the prompt P to P = (Prefix FA1(t) Suffix) where FA1 is a string formattingfunction. By having a fixed prefix and suffix, we exclude cases where an adversary could encodeadditional information via P (e.g., vector-database queries). The model M responds to this promptwith M(PA1(t)) = {(aj, vj)}1≤j≤k the set of tuples it could infer from the text. For our experi-ments in Section 5, we additionally ask the model to provide its reasoning behind each inference.It is important to note that across all settings M is a pre-trained LLM. In particular, the adversary Aiis no longer limited by the resource-intensive task of collecting a large training dataset and traininga model on it. Using pre-trained “off-the-shelf” LLMs reduces such initial investments significantly,lowering the entry barrier for adversaries and enabling scaling. We explore this tradeoff further in4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Appendix D by showing that on a restricted set of ACS (Ding et al., 2021) attributes, LLMs achievestrong 0-shot attribute inference performances, even compared to specifically finetuned classifiers.In Section 5, we present our main experiments on real-world free text inference. We show that LLMsare already close to and sometimes even surpass the capabilities of human labelers on real-worlddata (Section 4). Several instances where human labelers required additional information could becorrectly inferred by models based on text alone. Importantly, as we show in Section 6, we findthat the models’ strong inferential capabilities allow them to correctly infer personal attributes from,e.g., the specific language (such as local phrases) or subtle context that persists even under state-of-the-art text anonymization. Furthermore, such inferences become increasingly cheaper, allowingadversaries to scale beyond what would previously have been achievable with human experts.3.2ADVERSARIAL INTERACTIONWith a rapidly increasing number of LLM-based chatbots and millions of people already using themdaily, an emerging threat beyond free text inference is an active malicious deployment of LLMs. Insuch a setting, a seemingly benign chatbot steers a conversation with the user in a way that leadsthem to produce text that allows the model to learn private and potentially sensitive information. Thisnaturally extends over the passive setup of free text inference, as it enables the model to actively in-fluence the interaction with the user, mining for private information. We formalize this setting below.Figure 3: Illustration of the adversarial interaction. The useris unaware of Th given by the adversary. The model steersthe conversation in each round to refine prior information.Assume the user has only black-boxaccess to the LLM, where, crucially,the system prompt S is only accessi-ble by the adversary A2. Let Tp bethe public task of the LLM, e.g., “be-ing a helpful travel assistant”. Addi-tionally, let Th be a potentially ma-licious hidden task of the LLM, inour case, trying to extract private in-formation from the user.The sys-tem prompt of the LLM is a combina-tion of both tasks, i.e., S = (Tp, Th).Each round i of conversation between the user and the LLM consists of: (1) a user message mi, (2) ahidden model response rhi only available to the model hosting entity (e.g., PII inferences from priorresponses), and (3) a public model response rpi revealed to the user. For such an attack to succeed,besides fulfilling Th, Th must also remain hidden from the user throughout the interaction.In Section 5, we instantiate the A2 adversary using a free-conversational chatbot, mimicking thesetup of popular platforms such as Character.AI (ChAI, 2022), with the hidden task of inferringpersonal attributes of the user. Our simulated experiment demonstrates that such a setup is alreadyachievable with current LLMs, raising serious concerns about user privacy on such platforms.4A DATASET FOR LLM-BASED AUTHOR PROFILINGAs mentioned in Section 2, a key issue in evaluating author profiling capabilities is the lack ofavailable datasets (Villegas et al., 2014). While there are commonly used datasets for LLM privacyresearch, such as the Enron-Email dataset (Klimt & Yang, 2004), these generally do not come withground truth attribute labels. We found only one commonly used source of ground-truth labeleddatasets in English: the yearly PAN competition datasets, which for author profiling consist of aset of texts (often tweets) with ground-truth labels for 1 to 3 attributes, commonly gender and age.This is a substantial limitation when compared to the broad personal data definitions presented inSection 2. We provide an evaluation for the (latest) author profiling dataset (PAN 2018) in Ap-pendix E—showing how GPT-4 outperforms all prior approaches by a significant margin.Key RequirementsTo investigate LLMs’ real-world attribute inference capabilities, we state twokey requirements that a dataset should satisfy: (1) The texts must accurately reflect commonly usedonline language. As users interact with LLMs primarily in an online setting and given the volume5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024of online texts, they are inherently at the highest risk of being subject to LLM inferences. (2) Adiverse set of personal attributes associated with each text. Data protection regulations (Section 2)are deliberately formulated to protect a wide range of personal attributes, which is not reflected byexisting datasets, that focus on one or two common attributes. This is particularly relevant as theincreasing capabilities of LLMs will enable the inference of more personal information from texts.Table 1: Number of attributes per hardness score inthe PersonalReddit dataset consisting of 1184 total la-bels. We give a detailed overview in Appendix A.Hard. SEX LOC MARAGE SCH OCC POB INC148733745334520102185711134869272127366581546186684123706302650123401121184311251168149123795053The PersonalReddit (PR) DatasetTofulfill these requirements, we constructedPersonalReddit (PR), a dataset consistingof 520 randomly sampled public Redditprofiles consisting of 5814 comments be-tween 2012 and early 2016. We restrictedcomments to a set of 381 subreddits (seeAppendix J.1) likely to contain personal at-tributes.Inspired by datasets created bythe American Census Bureau (ACS), weselected the following eight attribute cat-egories:age (AGE), education (SCH),sex (SEX), occupation (OCC), relation-ship state (MAR), location (LOC), place of birth (POB), income (INC). We created ground truthlabels by manually annotating attributes for all selected profiles. To ensure personal data is handledresponsibly, labeling was not outsourced but only conducted by authors of the paper (referred toas labelers). We give a detailed overview of the labeling guidelines in Appendix J.2 and aggregatedataset statistics in Appendix A. Labelers were asked to extract attribute values from each profile,providing perceived certainty and hardness scores on a 1-5 scale. We provide qualitative examplesfor each level in Appendix A. For hardness scores 4-5, labelers could use internet search engines(excluding LLMs). While perceived hardness increases with the score for humans, samples of hard-ness 4 often require extra information (internet search) but less reasoning than hardness 3. Further,labelers could view subreddit names not included in our LLM evaluation prompts in 5. This hadtwo advantages: (1) It enabled labelers to create better ground-truth labels, often inferring mean-ingful information from the subreddit. (2) It allowed us to test LLM inference capabilities in aninformation-limited setting, assessing their ability to infer attributes from texts without meta infor-mation. The labeling procedure took roughly 112 man-hours (we refer to Appendix H for detailson LLM speedups). To address potential memorization, we provide an extensive decontaminationstudy of our dataset in Appendix B, showing that no memorization besides very few common URLsand quotes occurred. Due to the personal data contained in the dataset, we do not plan to make itpublic. Instead, we provide 525 human-verified synthetic examples, detailed in Appendix F.5EVALUATION OF PRIVACY VIOLATING LLM INFERENCESFree Text Inference on PersonalRedditIn our main experiment, we evaluate the capabilities of 9state-of-the-art LLMs at inferring personal author attributes on our PersonalReddit (PR) dataset. Weselect all attribute labels from PR with a certainty rating of at least 3 (quite certain). This resultedin 1066 (down from 1184) individual labels across all 520 profiles. Using the prompt templatepresented Appendix I, we then jointly predicted all attributes (per profile). For each attribute, we askthe models for their top 3 guesses in order (presenting all options for categoricals, see Appendix A).We present our main findings in Figure 4, showing the total number of correct inferences per modeland target attribute. First, we observe that GPT-4 performed the best across all models with a top-1 accuracy of 85.5% across attributes. In Appendix C, we show that this number rises to 95.2%when looking at top-3 predictions—almost matching human labels. This is especially remarkableas humans, unlike the models, were (1) able to see corresponding subreddits in which a commentoccurred and (2) had unlimited access to traditional search engines. In total, PR contains 51 labels,which humans could only infer using subreddits (e.g., subreddits like /r/Houston)—many of whichGPT-4 inferred from text alone. Further, we can observe a clear trend when comparing model sizesand attribute inference performance. While Llama-2 7B achieves a total accuracy of 51%, Llama-270B is already at 66%. This trend also persists across model families (assuming common estimatesof model sizes), a fact especially worrying considering the already strong performance of GPT-4.6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 4: Accuracies of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the PersonalReddit dataset. GPT-4 achieves thehighest total top-1 accuracy of 85.5%. Note that Human had additional information.Table 2: Individual accuracies [%] for GPT-4 on allattributes in the PR dataset.Attr. SEX LOC MARAGE SCH OCC POB INCAcc. 97.8 86.2 91.5 78.3 67.8 71.6 92.7 62.5Individual attributesWe further showthe individual attribute accuracy of GPT-4 in Table 2 (for other models we refer toAppendix C). We first observe that each at-tribute is predicted with an accuracy of atleast 60%, with gender and place of birthachieving almost 97% and 92%, respec-tively. GPT-4 shows its lowest performance on income; however, this is also the attribute withthe lowest number of samples (only 40) available. Further, when looking at the top-2 accuracy(given in Appendix C), we find a significant jump to 87%, indicating that humans and the modelare not generally misaligned. For example, we find that GPT-4 prefers predicting ”Low Income(< 30k)” instead of ”No income” as the first guess, potentially a result of model alignment. We par-ticularly highlight the 86% accuracy of location predictions, which are in a non-restricted freetext format. As we will show in Section 6, this performance remains strong even when removing alldirect location references with state-of-the-art anonymizers.Figure 5: Accuracies [%] for each hardness level for onerepresentative model of each family. We observe a cleardecrease in accuracy with increasing hardness scores.HardnessOurlastexperimentdemonstrates that our human-labeledhardness scores and overall model per-formance are well aligned. In particular,we show in Section 5, for one repre-sentative model of each family, theiraccuracy across each hardness level(we provide full results in Appendix C).For all models,we can observe adecrease in accuracy with increasinghardness scores, indicating that modelsand human labelers generally agree onwhich examples are harder.We alsoobserve that the decrease from 3 to 4 isless clear than for other scores, notablywith GPT-4 achieving a higher accuracyon hardness 4 than 3. Referring backto Section 4, this can be explained byexamples in 4 often requiring humans to search for additional information (e.g., by mentioninga specific local drink) but not strong reasoning capabilities as in 3. Therefore, hardness 4 favorsmodels that can accurately retrieve information across various topics. We will observe a similarbehavior on anonymized text in Section 6.7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Figure 6: Shortened conversationbetween our bots. We give the fullconversation in Appendix J.3.Adversarial InteractionIn Section 3, we have formalizedthe emerging threat of active adversarial chatbots that incon-spicuously steer their conversations to learn private user in-formation. A practical evaluation of this threat with real per-sons would raise serious ethical concerns. Therefore, we sim-ulated the experiment, demonstrating that it is already possibleto build such malicious chatbots. Similar to popular platformslike CharacterAi (ChAI, 2022), we set the public task Tp tobe an engaging conversational partner while now additionallysetting Th to “extract the user’s place of living, age, and sex”.In each conversation round, we extracted rhi with a summaryof what the bot knows, including the reasoning for their nextpublic response rpi . We show an example of one such roundin Figure 6. To simulate this interaction, we construct user-bots grounded in a synthetic profile (including age, sex, etc.),as well as real hardness 5 examples from PublicReddit. Userbots are specifically instructed to not reveal any of the private information. We instantiate all modelswith GPT-4, running 224 interactions on 20 different user profiles. Across all runs, the adversaryachieves a top-1 accuracy of 59.2% (location 60.3%, age: 49.6%, sex: 67.9%). While simulated,these numbers are similar to GPT-4’s performance on PersonalReddit, indicating an alignment be-tween our user bot and real data. We include full examples of simulated interactions in Appendix J.3,showing that already now adversarial chatbots are an emerging privacy threat.6EVALUATION OF CURRENT MITIGATIONSTo evaluate the effectiveness of current mitigations, we investigate (1) the impact of industry-standard text anonymization procedures on Free Text Inference and (2) the impact of model align-ment with respect to privacy-invasive prompts.Figure 7: Shortcomings of current anonymizers.

Anexception is a very recent language agent architecture, namely Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), andseveral other related work, e.g., Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023b) and Generative Agents (Parket al., 2023), which use verbal feedback, namely self-reflection, to help agents learn from priorfailure. These reflective agents convert binary or scalar reward from the environment into verbalfeedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional context to the promptfor the language agent. The self-reflection feedback acts as a semantic signal by providing the agentwith a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn from prior mistakes and prevent repetitiveerrors to perform better in the next attempt.Although the self-reflection operation enables iterative refinement, generating useful reflective feed-back from a pre-trained, frozen LLM is challenging, as showcased in Fig. 1, since it requires the*Corresponding Authors†Website for Retroformer & demos: https://Retroformer.github.io/‡Code: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/Retroformer1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024LLM to have a good understanding of where the agent made mistakes in a specific environment, i.e.,the credit assignment problem (Sutton & Barto, 2018), as well as the ability to generate a summarycontaining actionable insights for improvement. The verbal reinforcement cannot be optimal, if thefrozen language model has not been properly fine-tuned to specialize in credit assignment problemsfor the tasks in given environments. Furthermore, the existing language agents do not reason andplan in ways that are compatible with differentiable, gradient-based learning from rewards by ex-ploiting the existing abundant reinforcement learning techniques. To address these limitations, thispaper introduces Retroformer, a principled framework for reinforcing language agents by learn-ing a plug-in retrospective model, which automatically refines the language agent prompts fromenvironment feedback through policy optimization. Specifically, our proposed agent architecturecan learn from arbitrary reward information across multiple environments and tasks, for iterativelyfine-tuning a pre-trained language model, which refines the language agent prompts by reflecting onfailed attempts and assigning credits of actions taken by the agent on future rewards.Lollipop Chainsaw featured Juliet Starling, who was voiced by a Canadian-American actress who has done voice roles for what Teen Titans spinoff series?1.

Action sequences in prior trialI should have searched for Lollipop Chainsaw first and looked up the Canadian-American actress who voiced Juliet Starling afterwards. I also should have looked up Tara Strong's filmography and searched for any voice roles she did specifically for Teen Titans or Teen Titans Go!3.

Action sequences in next trial+add to agent promptFigure 1: An example of uninformative self-reflections from a frozen LLM. The root cause of failurein prior trial is that the agent should have only submitted the spinoff series “Teen Titans Go” and not“Teen Titans” in the answer. The agent forgot its goal during a chain of lengthy interactions. Theverbal feedback from a frozen LLM, however, only rephrases the prior failed actions sequences asthe proposed plan, resulting repetitive, incorrect actions in the next trial.We conduct experiments on a number of real-world tasks including HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018),which involves search-based question answering tasks, AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021), in whichthe agent solves embodied robotics tasks through low-level text actions, and WebShop (Yao et al.,2022), a browser environment for web shopping. We observe Retroformer agents are fasterlearners compared with Reflexion, which does not use gradient for reasoning and planning, and arebetter decision-makers and reasoners. More concretely, Retroformer agents improve the successrate in HotPotQA by 18% with 4 retries, 36% in AlfWorld with 3 retries and 4% in WebShop, whichdemonstrate the effectiveness of gradient-based learning for LLM action agents.To summarize, our contributions are the following:• The paper introduces Retroformer, which iteratively refines the prompts given to large lan-guage agents based on environmental feedback to improve learning speed and task completion.We take a policy gradient approach with the Actor LLM being part of the environment, allowinglearning from a wide range of reward signals for diverse tasks.• The proposed method focuses on fine-tuning the retrospective model in the language agent sys-tem architecture, without accessing the Actor LLM parameters or needing to propagate gradientsthrough it. The agnostic nature of Retroformer makes it a flexible plug-in module for varioustypes of cloud-based LLMs, such as OpenAI GPT or Google Bard.2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20242RELATED WORKAutonomous Language AgentsWe summarize in Table 1 the recent language agent literaturerelated to our work from five perspectives and differentiate our method from them. The completionof a complex task typically involves numerous stages. An AI agent must possess knowledge of thesestages and plan accordingly. Chain-of-Thoughts or CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is the pioneering workthat prompts the agent to decompose challenging reasoning tasks into smaller, more manageablesteps. ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), on the other hand, proposes the exploitation of this reasoningand acting proficiency within LLM to encourage interaction with the environment (e.g. using theWikipedia search API) by mapping observations to the generation of reasoning and action tracesor API calls in natural language. This agent architecture has spawned various applications, such asHuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), WebGPT (Nakano et al.,2021), AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023), and BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023).Table 1: Related work on large language agents.ApproachGradientArbitraryIterativeHiddenDecisionMemorylearningrewardrefinementconstraintsmakingCoT (Wei et al., 2022)✗✗✗✗✗✗ReAct (Yao et al., 2023)✗✗✗✓✓✓Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023b)✗✗✓✗✗✗RAP (Hao et al., 2023)✗✗✓✓✓✓Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023)✗✗✓✓✓✓Retroformer (our method)✓✓✓✓✓✓However, these approaches fail to learn from valuable feedback, such as environment rewards, to en-hance the agent’s behaviors, resulting in performances that are solely dependent on the quality of thepre-trained LLM. Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023a) addresses this limitation by employing a singleLLM as a generator, refiner, and provider of feedback, allowing for iterative refinement of outputs.However, it is not specifically tailored for real-world task-based interaction with the environment.On the other hand, RAP (Hao et al., 2023) repurposes the LLM to function as both a world modeland a reasoning agent. It incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategic exploration within theextensive realm of reasoning with environment rewards. This approach enables effective naviga-tion and decision-making in complex domains. Recently, Shinn et al. (2023) presents Reflexion, aframework that equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities, enhancing theirreasoning skills. Self-reflection plays a pivotal role, allowing autonomous agents to iteratively refinepast actions, make improvements, and prevent repetitive errors.Transformer Reinforcement LearningReinforcement learning with a provided reward functionor a reward-labeled dataset, commonly referred to as RLHF, has become a standard practice withinthe LLM fine-tuning pipeline. These endeavors have convincingly demonstrated the efficacy of RLas a means to guide language models towards desired behaviors that align with predefined rewardfunctions encompassing various domains, including machine translation, summarization, and gen-erating favorable reviews. Among the prevalent transformer RL methods are online RL algorithmssuch as Proximal Policy Optimization or PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and offline RL techniquessuch as Implicit Language Q-Learning or ILQL (Snell et al., 2022) and Direct Preference Optimiza-tion or DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). These methods have been implemented in TRL/TRLX (vonWerra et al., 2020; Max et al., 2023) distributed training framework.3NOTATION AND FORMULATIONIn this work, we denote a large language model (LLM) based action agent as a function Mξl : X →A, where X is the space of prompts, which may include the actual prompts xu provided by the users,as well as some contextual information c ∈C. Here C is the space of context as a representation ofthe current state S returned by the environment Ω. A is the space of actions. Note the actions takenby most language model based agents are sampled auto-repressively, so M is a random function.The subscript ξl denotes the re-parameterized random variables involved in the sampling process.Another note is, the LLM-based agent itself is stateless. All the states and possible memorizationare characterized as text in the agent prompt x.3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024The environment is defined as a tuple (Tξo, R). Tξo : S × A →S is the state transition function,where S is the space of states and A is the action space. Here we assume the states and actions arerepresented using text. Again we used ξo to represent the randomness involved in the state transition.For each state s ∈S, a reward function is defined as R : S →R. At each step of the play, the state sis described using natural language, and integrated into the context c. In the context, previous statesmay also be described and embedded to help LLMs making a good guess on the next action to take.As in all the reinforcement learning setting, the final goal is to maximize the cumulative rewards,or episode returns Gcum = PTt=0 R(st). In many situations, the rewards are sparse, i.e., R(st) aremostly zero except very few states, such as in the terminal state for indicating task success or failure.The retrospective model takes the all the previous states s1,··· ,t, actions a1,··· ,t, rewards r1,··· ,t, andthe user prompt xu as input, and massage them into a new prompt x to be consumed by the LLM:Γξr,Θ : [Si, Ai, Ri, X ui ]ti=1 →X,(1)where ξr stands for the randomness involved in the retrospective model, and Θ is the set of learnableparameters in the retrospective model. The goal of the RL optimization isarg maxΘEξl,ξo,ξr"" TXt=1R(st)#s.t.st+1 = Tξo"," thispaper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agentsby learning a retrospective model , which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient .

"SST-20.8680.895Trec0.3110.653Mpqa0.6900.807Disaster0.6570.656Table 9: Comparison between DP-OPT and DLN-1 using sanitized data (Mattern et al., 2022). Testaccuracy averaged over 3 repetitions are reported on SST-2 using Vicuna-7B.The implementation includes three steps: (1) First, the embedding of each token will be perturbedand projected into the original embedding space. This step can be extended to other sanitizationmethods (Utpala et al., 2023; Feyisetan et al., 2020). (2) We use DLN-1 to tune prompts on thesesamples. DLN-1 is selected here due to its similarity to our method but can be replaced by otherprompt-tuning algorithms in practice. (3) We use the generated prompts for inference. Note that thetext sanitization is measured under the metric Differential Privacy instead of standard DP. Because ofthe different privacy assumptions, we emphasize that the meaning of ϵ is different. We show that ourmethod can outperform Private DLN-1 significantly on three datasets and has similar performance asPrivate DLN-1 on Disaster.Generated Prompts. In Tables 10 and 11, we give more examples of prompts generated by LLMs.DLN-1 is able to generate a very semantic prompt (e.g., seed 1 in SST-2 task) but may fail to transfer(with a 3.5% drop). Consistent with the conclusions in the main content, the DLN-1 tends to leakmore private information and DP-OPT presents much less visible leakage. In the hardest task, Trec,DLN-1 extensively overfits the source model with semantically favored prompts but transfers poorlyto DaVinci where two prompts suffer from negative transfer.Interestingly, we see that “# Student successes Input:” does not provide useful task information butoften occurs to enjoy positive transfer, e.g., DP-OPT on SST-2 and Disaster. We conjecture that theprompt induces the LLM to produce “success” output.We notice that the prompt engineering degrades to generating dummy samples sometimes. However,our method can create prompts without samples and promote the performance, as well. For example,DP-OPT may only slightly change the prompt by appending “ # Student successes Input:” to aninitial instruction. Intuitively, the modification prompts LLMs to generate “successful” responses.We notice such minor modifications can improve the accuracy of the Disaster dataset from 76.4%(0-shot) to 78.9% (DP-OPT) tested by DaVinci-003. It even outperforms more complicated promptsgenerated by DLN-1 (77%).Avoid Privacy Leakage via Instruction. When we notice the direct breach of training samplesin generated prompts, a straightforward fixture could be to instruct LLMs to keep secrets. Wetried two of such instructions in experiments: (1) Instruction 1: Do not provide examplesin the prompt. (2) Instruction 2: Do not use existing samples but createdummy samples as examples in the prompt. For DLN-1 and (DP-)OPT, we all ap-pend the privatization instruction to the instruction in the backward template. We test the instructionson SST-2 following the same setting in the main experiment and report the generated prompts inTable 12. We notice Instruction 1 still leaks private samples and the AUC measured by LikelihoodRatio MIA attack is as high as 73%. Interestingly, the second instruction only generates dummy ex-amples that have no similar examples in the training set. However, the prompt will present non-trivialrisks (69% AUC) measured by Likelihood Ratio MIA attack.In conclusion, though privatization instruction could remove private examples, it still suffers frominformation leakage. The method is orthogonal to our method that provides theoretical guaranteesand can be combined with our DP-OPT to reduce the chance of explicit leakage.21Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Table 10: Generated prompts.

However, they do not require major-level knowledgerelated to the domain.Example: When the Founders met in 1787 to write the Constitution, what was their primaryobjective?Major level knowledge: Questions that require understanding domain-specific concepts andcoming up with novel answers that are creative and sound. People majoring in the domaincan solve these questions.Example: According to Kubler-Ross, when a terminally ill patient is informed of his/hercondition, what would the patient’s initial reaction likely be?Expert level knowledge: Questions that require understanding uncommon or professionaldomain-specific knowledge and coming up with novel answers that are creative and sound.A profession in a specific field of the target domain is required.Example: A company owned a night club that was built on a pier extending into a majorriverbed. For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, par-ticularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against thestructure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did notrespond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customersand employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club forviolating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and chargedhim with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act werelegally insufficient to establish manslaughter.
