The labels are supportive (entailment inthe NLI task) or not supportive (either neutral or contradiction in the NLI task). Then we evaluate thestate-of-the-art NLI model over this dataset and calculate its accuracy.B.6UNCERTAINTY ANSWER RATIO WHEN LLMS ENCOUNTER KNOWLEDGE CONFLICTIn Table B.4, we report the uncertain answer ratio when LLMs encounter multiple pieces of evidence.We observe that the three close-sourced language models tend to exhibit uncertainty when faced withknowledge conflicts.B.7IRRELEVANT EVIDENCEWe collect irrelevant evidence for the question from the human-written corpus (i.e., Wikipediapassages provided by POPQA). Specifically, we use SentenceBERT to retrieve the top 3 sentenceswith the highest similarity to the question. We limit our search to data within the same question type.Note that we exclude any evidence that includes the entity mentioned in the parametric memory orcounter-memory , as it would affect the arrangement of our options. The method for constructingoptions for irrelevant evidence is based on the template provided in the Table B.2.19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024B.8FRAGMENTED EVIDENCEThe STRATEGYQA dataset incorporates human-written facts associated with each sub-question. Inthe standard mode, we merge these facts to construct an intact piece of evidence. However, in SectionA.2, we treat each fact as an individual piece of evidence, without any consolidation.CPROMPTS LISTIn Table C.9, we provide a comprehensive list of all the prompts that have been utilized in this study,offering a clear reference for understanding our experimental approach.20Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Examples of Answer InconsistencyChatGPT on POPQAThe first paragraph answers the question and the second paragraph gives the reason.Q: Who is the mother of Eliot Sumner?A: The mother of Eliot Sumner is the actress and musician Trudie Styler.Trudie Styler is the wife of the musician Sting, who is Eliot Sumner’s father.
